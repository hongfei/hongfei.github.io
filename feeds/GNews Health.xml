			&lt;p&gt;The constant ebb and flow of hormones that guide the menstrual cycle don't just affect reproductive organs – they also reshape the brain, and a 2023 study gives us insight into how this happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by neuroscientists Elizabeth Rizor and Viktoriya Babenko of the University of California, Santa Barbara, a team of researchers tracked 30 women across their menstrual cycles, documenting structural changes in the brain as hormonal profiles fluctuate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.26785"&gt;peer-reviewed study&lt;/a&gt;, the findings suggest that structural brain changes during menstruation may not be limited to those regions associated with the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/long-covid-could-mess-with-menstruation-in-a-horrid-feedback-loop"&gt;Long COVID Could Mess With Menstruation in a Horrid Feedback Loop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These results are the first to report simultaneous brain-wide changes in human white matter microstructure and cortical thickness coinciding with menstrual cycle-driven hormone rhythms," &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.26785"&gt;the researchers wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Strong brain-hormone interaction effects may not be limited to classically known hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal-axis (HPG-axis) receptor-dense regions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_142259" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-142259" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/menstruation_cycle.jpg" alt="menstrual cycle diagram" class="wp-image-142259 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/menstruation_cycle.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/menstruation_cycle-600x364.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-142259" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(Rujirat Boonyong/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menstruation typically means experiencing some 450 or so periods during the course of a lifetime, so understanding their effects on the body is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, despite affecting roughly half the world's population &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/menstrual-cycle/your-menstrual-cycle"&gt;for half their lives&lt;/a&gt;, research has &lt;a href="https://acmedsci.ac.uk/more/news/a-mans-world-how-healthcare-and-research-is-failing-women"&gt;been somewhat lacking&lt;/a&gt;. Who knows why. &lt;a href="https://www.rand.org/blog/2022/02/underfunding-of-research-in-womens-health-issues-is.html"&gt;Total mystery&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/womens-health-massively-underfunded-and-one-biggest-missed-opportunities-health"&gt;Seriously&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the research on the hormonal effect on the brain has been focused on neural communication during cognitive tasks, not on structural changes themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cyclic fluctuations in HPG-axis hormones exert powerful behavioral, structural, and functional effects through actions on the mammalian central nervous system," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.26785"&gt;Rizor, Babenko, and their team noted&lt;/a&gt;. "Yet, very little is known about how these fluctuations alter the structural nodes and information highways of the human brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The microstructure of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_matter"&gt;white matter&lt;/a&gt; – the fatty network of neuronal fibers that transfer information between regions of gray matter – has been found to change with hormonal shifts, including puberty, oral contraception use, gender-affirming hormone therapy, and post-menopausal estrogen therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_142255" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-142255" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/white_matter_tracts.jpg" alt="white matter tracts in the brain" class="wp-image-142255 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/white_matter_tracts.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/white_matter_tracts-600x364.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-142255" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;White matter tracts connecting regions in the human brain. (Thom Leach/Science Photo Library)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address the menstruation gap in our understanding, the team took  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="176272" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; scans of their subjects during three menstrual phases: menses, ovulation, and mid-&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24417-luteal-phase"&gt;luteal&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of each of these scans, the researchers also measured the participants' hormone levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that, as hormones fluctuate, gray and white matter volumes change too, as does the volume of cerebrospinal fluid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, just before ovulation, when the hormones &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol"&gt;17β-estradiol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22255-luteinizing-hormone"&gt;luteinizing hormone&lt;/a&gt; rise, the brains of the participants showed white matter changes suggesting faster information transfer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24638-follicle-stimulating-hormone-fsh"&gt;Follicle-stimulating hormone&lt;/a&gt;, which rises before ovulation, and helps stimulate the ovary follicles, was associated with thicker gray matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/24562-progesterone"&gt;Progesterone&lt;/a&gt;, which rises after ovulation, was associated with increased tissue and decreased cerebrospinal fluid volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What this means for the person driving the brain is unknown, but the research lays the groundwork for future studies, and perhaps understanding the causes of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9132-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder-pmdd"&gt;unusual but severe period-related mental health problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44294-024-00012-4"&gt;A separate study published in 2024&lt;/a&gt; by an international team of scientists found each phase of the menstrual cycle had a distinct influence over the brain as a whole, with changes across the brain and in specific regions found to also be related to an individual's age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although we do not currently report functional consequences or correlates of structural brain changes, our findings may have implications for hormone-driven alterations in behavior and cognition," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.26785"&gt;the researchers wrote.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investigation of brain-hormone relationships across networks is necessary to understand human nervous system functioning on a daily basis, during hormone transition periods, and across the human lifespan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are reported in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.26785"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Human Brain Mapping&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in October 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I’m not going to make a marinara sauce from scratch.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2019 analysis by Hall and his colleagues found that ultra-processed foods led participants to eat about 500 calories a day more than when they ate a matched diet of unprocessed foods, suggesting they are addictive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the findings, Hall says he hasn't been put off UPFs and he 'treats them as recreational substances'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Opening up about his typical daily diet, he made another surprising revelation: that he doesn't eat breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some nutritionists say skipping breakfast has consequences, as it may lead to low energy, poor concentration, overeating later in the day, or blood sugar imbalances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Kevin Hall served as a nutrition and metabolism scientist at the National Institutes of Health for 21 years before quitting this spring amid complaints that his work was being censored by the Trump government&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Hall simply says he's 'not a breakfast eater' and he prefers to start his day with a coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For a morning snack, around 11:30am, his go-tos are fruit, nuts or hard boiled eggs and then for lunch, at 1pm, he generally has leftovers from the night before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For dinner, Hall says that marinara sauce (which is a tomato sauce usually made with tomatoes, garlic, herbs, and onions) 'plays a pretty prominent role' in his household.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His favorite recipe is mixing the sauce with frozen scallops and whole-wheat pasta, with some grilled vegetables. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Those are common things in our household, at least for the adults.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For his children, he says he and his wife pick out things that they known they will like as 'they are very particular.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While they like farmed Atlantic salmon, vegetables rice and beans, another of their favorite foods are chicken nuggets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nutritionists generally advise against UPFs, such as chicken nuggets, as studies have linked them to various negative health impacts, including increased risks of cancer, heart disease, stroke, and early death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These foods often contain unhealthy levels of fat, sugar, and salt, while lacking essential fiber, vitamins, and minerals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But for Hall, chicken nuggets are a convenient dinner solution for his picky children. 'It can be a little challenging, but we make it work for the whole family,' he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ultra-processed foods have exploded in the US and elsewhere in recent decades, just as rates of obesity and other diet-related diseases also rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A 2019 analysis by Hall and his colleagues found that ultra-processed foods led participants to eat about 500 calories a day more than when they ate a matched diet of unprocessed foods, suggesting they are addictive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The foods, which are often high in fat, sodium and sugar, are typically cheap, mass-produced and contain added colors and chemicals not found in a home kitchen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Think sugary cereals and potato chips, frozen pizzas, sodas and ice cream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, even healthier options like pasta sauce and salad kits are often processed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have linked ultra-processed foods to negative health effects, but whether it's the actual processing of the foods (rather than the amount of calories they contain or the chemicals in them) remains uncertain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following his 2019 analysis exposing ultra-processed foods, Hall launched a more in-depth multimillion-dollar study this year which saw three dozen participants paid $5,000 each to devote 28 days of their lives to science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During the study, the subjects were monitored as they ate different foods to understand how processing impacts digestion and metabolism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results from the trial are set to be published later this year, but Hall previously said the preliminary results were intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At a scientific conference in November 2024, he reported that the first 18 trial participants ate about 1,000 calories a day more of an ultra-processed diet that was particularly hyperpalatable and energy dense than those who ate minimally processed foods, leading to weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When those qualities were modified, consumption went down, even if the foods were considered ultra-processed, Hall said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NIH spends about $2 billion a year, about five percent of its total budget, on nutrition research, according to Senate documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Ghostly lights dancing in midair in swamps, forests, and even graveyards have been reported by cultures all over the world, for centuries. According to a new study, there could be a logical explanation after all: a strange form of 'microlightning'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will-o%27-the-wisp"&gt;will-o'-the-wisps&lt;/a&gt;, jack-o'-lanterns, or &lt;em&gt;ignis fatuus&lt;/em&gt;, these bizarre floating flames have understandably inspired many a colorful back story. They're sometimes explained as the spirits of the dead, or lanterns carried by lost souls doomed to roam the land forever after &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/533988"&gt;tricking the Devil&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ball-lightning-caught-on-film-after-storm-in-canada"&gt;'Ball Lightning' Caught on Film After Storm in Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what is the science behind this fanciful folklore? More grounded explanations have included pockets of swamp gas that spontaneously ignite, but they shouldn't be able to spark up without a clear trigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a study led by Stanford University chemists suggests that microlightning could be to blame. These tiny bolts of electrical energy could form in electric fields where gases meet liquids, then jump between bubbles of different charges and ignite methane gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175903" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175903" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/microlightning-1.png" alt="Ghostly Lights Seen For Centuries Could Have a Strange Explanation" class="wp-image-175903 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175903" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Flashes of microlightning can be seen between bubbles in the team's experiments. (Xia et al., &lt;em&gt;PNAS,&lt;/em&gt; 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In lab experiments, the team piped air and methane into water to generate tiny bubbles, and watched them with a high-speed camera. And sure enough, flashes of microlightning were clearly captured throughout, each lasting a fraction of a millisecond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the flashes were seen even when only air bubbles were introduced, more microlightning seemed to flare up when methane was present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microlightning between methane microbubbles offers a natural ignition mechanism for methane oxidation under ambient conditions," the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2521255122"&gt;researchers write&lt;/a&gt; in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This discovery supports a long-suspected link between electrified interfaces and spontaneous cool flames, and it provides a physically grounded explanation for the occurrence of ignis fatuus."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon might not just explain the mysterious will-o'-the-wisps – it could have played a key role in our own existence. Some of the same researchers &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microlightning-could-help-solve-a-crucial-question-on-how-life-began"&gt;previously suggested&lt;/a&gt; that this kind of microlightning could have provided the original spark that set off the chemical reactions that let life arise from non-living matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2521255122"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For millions of retirees, turning 65 and &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-seniors-should-know-about-medicare-open-enrollment-for-2025/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;enrolling in Medicare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; can feel like crossing the finish line after decades of paying into the system. But what many are surprised to discover after enrolling is that Original Medicare — which includes Parts A and B — &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-are-the-things-that-original-medicare-wont-cover/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;doesn't cover everything&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Hospital stays, doctor visits, and certain preventive services are included, but things like deductibles, copays and other uncovered services can quickly add up. Medicare is &lt;a href="https://www.mutualofomaha.com/advice/medicare/medicare-costs/understanding-medicare-costs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;designed to cover about 80%&lt;/a&gt; of medical costs on average, after all, which leaves beneficiaries responsible for the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those out-of-pocket expenses can be manageable for some retirees. But for others — especially those with chronic conditions or those who have experienced major health events — the costs can be substantial. That's where &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-medicare-supplemental-insurance/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Medicare supplemental coverage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, also called Medigap, comes in. These private insurance plans are designed to fill in the gaps left by Original Medicare, but they come with extra monthly premiums. As a result, the big question for many retirees is whether it's truly necessary to pay for this additional coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://secure.money.com/pr/sd6ac5036842?s1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fdo-retirees-really-need-supplemental-coverage-with-original-medicare" target="_blank" rel="nofollow, sponsored, noopener"&gt;Compare your Medicare supplemental coverage options online now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do retirees really need supplemental coverage with Original Medicare?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every retiree will need Medigap coverage. For example, someone with a very low anticipated level of medical care, significant savings or other insurance, like retiree employer coverage or Medicaid, may be able to manage without it. But for most Medicare beneficiaries, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/when-should-you-buy-medicare-supplemental-insurance/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;supplemental coverage is a critical tool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to help control costs and protect against unpredictable medical bills. Here are a few key reasons why it's often worth having:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Out-of-pocket costs with Original Medicare can be unpredictable and steep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original Medicare doesn't have a cap on out-of-pocket costs, meaning that there's no annual maximum like there would be with most employer or marketplace health insurance plans. So, if you need frequent care or &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-the-medicare-3-day-rule-how-does-it-impact-coverage/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;an extended hospital stay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and you only have Original Medicare coverage, your share of the costs could be thousands of dollars, and that's before factoring in any non-covered services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the &lt;a href="https://www.medicare.gov/basics/costs/medicare-costs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Medicare Part A hospital deductible&lt;/a&gt; is $1,676 per benefit period in 2025. After 60 days in the hospital, you're also responsible for daily coinsurance amounts that rise the longer your stay continues. Part B comes with its own annual deductible ($257 in 2025) and typically covers only 80% of approved services after that. That remaining 20% may not sound like much, but if you're facing major surgeries, outpatient treatments or ongoing therapies, it can add up quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medigap policies help insulate you from these types of unpredictable expenses. Depending on the plan, this coverage can cover most or all of the deductibles and coinsurance, providing peace of mind and more stable health care costs over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://secure.money.com/pr/sd6ac5036842?s1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fdo-retirees-really-need-supplemental-coverage-with-original-medicare" target="_blank" rel="nofollow, sponsored, noopener"&gt;Find out how you can fill in the gaps left by your Original Medicare coverage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health care needs typically increase with age, and Medicare doesn't cover everything&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even healthy retirees can expect their medical needs to grow as they age. More frequent doctor visits, specialist care, lab tests and hospitalizations are common — and Original Medicare's cost-sharing can become more burdensome as utilization increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medicare also doesn't cover some important types of care. &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-long-term-care-costs-does-medicare-cover/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Long-term care&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, most dental services, routine vision, hearing aids and prescription drugs (Part D is separate) are excluded. Supplemental coverage generally doesn't pay for everything either, but many retirees pair Medigap with a standalone Part D prescription plan to help control medication costs.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without supplemental coverage, retirees are more exposed to these rising costs at precisely the time in life when their health and often their income may be more vulnerable. A Medigap policy can &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-does-medicare-supplemental-insurance-work/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;serve as a financial buffer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, though, making it easier to manage both routine and unexpected care as health needs evolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supplemental coverage can provide more flexibility than Medicare Advantage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many retirees consider Medicare Advantage (Part C) plans as an alternative to enrolling in Original Medicare plus Medigap. That's because these plans often include prescription coverage and may have lower monthly premiums. However, they also typically use provider networks and may require referrals or prior authorizations for certain types of care, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-seniors-can-fill-medicare-insurance-coverage-gaps/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;which can be limiting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Original Medicare combined with Medigap allows beneficiaries to see any provider nationwide who accepts Medicare, without network restrictions. This flexibility can be especially valuable for retirees who split their time between states, travel frequently or want the freedom to choose their doctors and specialists without worrying about coverage denials or network rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Medigap premiums can be higher than some Medicare Advantage plans, the tradeoff is predictable cost-sharing and fewer hurdles when accessing care. For many retirees, the simplicity and predictability that come with &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-compare-medicare-supplemental-plans/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;the right Medicare supplemental&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; policy make it a worthwhile investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplemental coverage isn't mandatory when you enroll in Medicare, and some retirees may be able to manage without it. But for many people, Medigap plans play a crucial role in protecting against unexpected medical costs, providing flexibility and stabilizing out-of-pocket spending in retirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're approaching Medicare eligibility or evaluating your current coverage, consider your health history, financial resources and tolerance for risk as part of the decision-making process. Comparing Medigap plan options and premiums can help you find a balance between cost and protection. And remember: If you want Medigap coverage, the best time to buy is typically during your six-month &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-the-medigap-open-enrollment-period-and-why-is-it-important-experts-explain/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Medigap open enrollment period&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which starts the month you're 65 and enrolled in Part B. After that, you may face medical underwriting and higher costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression is a serious disorder that disrupts daily life through lethargy, sleep disturbance, and social withdrawal, and also increases the risk of suicide. The number of depression patients has steadily increased over the years, affecting more than 280 million people worldwide as of 2025. Now, researchers have uncovered a new pathological mechanism that could provide clues for the diagnosis and treatment of depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;A research team led by C. Justin Lee and Lee Boyoung at the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) has identified a new molecular pathway in the brain that directly links abnormal sugar modifications in proteins to depressive behaviors. Specifically, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronic+stress/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronic stress&lt;/a&gt; disrupts sugar chains (O-glycans) attached to proteins in the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/prefrontal+cortex/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;, thereby triggering depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ady2733" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;, open new possibilities for targeted therapies for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/treatment-resistant+depression/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;treatment-resistant depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression arises from a complex interplay of psychological, environmental, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+factors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic factors&lt;/a&gt;, and many different pathological mechanisms have been reported. However, most &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/antidepressant+drugs/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;antidepressant drugs&lt;/a&gt; in clinical use focus on regulating neurotransmitters, especially serotonin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These drugs, however, benefit only about half of patients and often cause side effects such as gastrointestinal problems or worsening anxiety. This limitation underscores the need to search for new molecular pathways in the brain beyond neurotransmitter signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on glycosylation, the process by which small sugar chains attach to proteins and alter their structure and function. Glycosylation has been recognized as an important mechanism in various diseases, including cancer, viral infections, and neurodegenerative disorders. Among its forms, O-glycosylation plays a role in cell signaling and maintaining balance in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neural+circuits/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neural circuits&lt;/a&gt;, though its involvement in brain disorders has only recently begun to be studied.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Using high-performance mass spectrometry, the team first analyzed O-glycosylation patterns in nine brain regions of healthy mice and found that each region exhibited distinct glycosylation features. They then compared these with the brains of chronically stressed mice, revealing significant alterations in O-glycosylation in regions such as the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, they observed a reduction in sialylation—the addition of sialic acid to the ends of sugar chains, which stabilizes proteins—along with decreased expression of the enzyme St3gal1, which mediates this modification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test whether this enzyme is directly linked to depressive behavior, the researchers manipulated St3gal1 expression in the prefrontal cortex of both normal and stressed mice. Suppressing St3gal1 in normal mice caused them to exhibit depressive-like symptoms—loss of motivation, heightened anxiety—even without stress. Conversely, increasing St3gal1 in stressed mice alleviated their depressive behaviors. These results identify decreased St3gal1 as a key molecular factor that directly induces and regulates depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further protein analyses and electrophysiological experiments showed that reduced St3gal1 destabilized the sugar chain structures of synaptic molecules, including neurexin 2 (NRXN2), a synaptic adhesion protein, and impaired the function of inhibitory neurons that normally help maintain balance in brain circuits. In other words, small changes in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/sugar+chains/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;sugar chains&lt;/a&gt; simultaneously disrupted both the connections and stability of neural circuits, ultimately collapsing the brain's emotion-regulation system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This study demonstrates that abnormal glycosylation in the brain is directly connected to the onset of depression," said Research Fellow Boyoung Lee. "It provides an important foothold for identifying new diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets beyond neurotransmitters."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Depression imposes a major social burden, yet current treatments remain limited," added Director C. Justin Lee. "This achievement could extend not only to depression therapy but also to other mental illnesses such as PTSD and schizophrenia, paving the way for broader therapeutic strategies."&lt;/p&gt;

In addition to the prison term, the sentence includes the forfeiture of $115,638 and a civil judgment in favor of the victims.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7808297887848592" data-ad-slot="3652501944"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The sentencing was handed down in New York State Supreme Court on October 1, according to an update from the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ilovetheupperwestside.com/tag/manhattan-da/" data-wpel-link="internal"&gt;Manhattan District Attorney’s office&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mateo’s scheme first came to light after the husband—who had been living with his wife at 380 Riverside Drive, near West 110th Street—passed away in September 2022. With the wife under legal guardianship in a nursing home and deemed mentally incapacitated, Mateo began transferring funds from their accounts into his own. Within 24 hours of the husband’s death, he had deposited the first of 26 fraudulent checks, many of which he had written to himself under misleading pretenses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the following months, Mateo also siphoned pension payments meant for the wife, a retired city schoolteacher. Prosecutors said he submitted forged documents to the Teachers’ Retirement System to reroute her annuity checks to his personal bank account—even after her death in July 2023. He also allegedly made multiple calls to the pension system pretending to be the woman, at one point altering his voice to mimic an elderly female.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In total, Mateo was accused of stealing $477,685 from the couple, who spent decades building their savings. At the time of the plea, D.A. Alvin Bragg described the theft as a “disturbing fraud,” vowing to protect vulnerable New Yorkers from financial exploitation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Alfredo Mateo will now be held accountable for stealing from a retired schoolteacher and her husband,” Bragg said following the sentencing. “He used his access as a doorman to drain their bank accounts, stealing hundreds of thousands of their hard-earned money. We will not allow fraudsters to exploit older New Yorkers for their own personal financial gain.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7808297887848592" data-ad-slot="3652501944"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Mateo was &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ilovetheupperwestside.com/uws-doorman-faces-serious-charges-for-stealing-almost-half-a-mill-from-elderly-residents/" data-wpel-link="internal"&gt;initially indicted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in October 2024, and entered his guilty plea in May 2025. His case drew widespread attention due to the sheer size of the theft and the calculated nature of the fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;380 Riverside Drive is a prewar co-op building just off Riverside Park.

Although experts had ‘younger’ brains than their less-experienced counterparts did, even learning a creative skill from scratch had an anti-ageing effect on &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03425-y" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03425-y" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were published on 3 October in &lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Song and dance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies suggest that engaging in creative activities can help to keep the brain young and foster emotional well-being. But few have investigated the biological basis of these brain benefits or what drives them, says study co-author Agustín Ibáñez, a neuroscientist at Adolfo Ibáñez University in Santiago, Chile. “There is really poor mechanistic evidence,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02086-9" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03197-z/d41586-025-03197-z_51161266.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How fast are you ageing? Ordinary brain scans reveal the pace&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;To address this gap, Ibáñez and his colleagues created brain clocks using neuroimaging data of brain activity taken from 1,240 participants across 10 countries. These machine-learning models used functional connectivity, a measure of how brain regions work together, to estimate brain age. The researchers then applied their brain clocks to 232 tango dancers, musicians, visual artists and video game players of different ages and experience levels to calculate their ‘brain age gap’ — the difference between their predicted brain age and their actual age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, all four creative pursuits seemed to delay brain ageing. The more skilled and experienced participants were at their chosen activity, the slower their brain aged. This anti-ageing effect was strongest in expert tango dancers, whose brains were, on average, seven years younger than their chronological age. Tango’s cognitively demanding mix of complex movement sequences, coordination and planning makes it a particularly good activity for keeping the brain young, says Ibáñez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers built a brain map to assess whether creativity has a protective effect on areas that are particularly vulnerable to ageing. They found that creativity had the greatest impact on the frontoparietal region, which controls various functions, including working memory and decision-making. This region is one of the most susceptible areas to age-related decline. In experienced participants, brain connections were notably strong in areas involved in movement control, coordination and rhythm, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But in older mice, as routines changed, the cells fired chaotically, evidence that their spatial memory had begun to break down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Spatial memory, or memory for locations or directions, becomes severely impaired with &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15136877/hidden-sign-alzheimers-early-symptoms-brain.html"&gt;forms of dementia like Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting the medial entorhinal cortex degrades with the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could pave the way for new treatments that specifically target this structure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers at Stanford University have uncovered a brain structure that may degrade in conditions like Alzheimer's disease (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Lisa Giocomo, senior study author, professor of neurobiology at Stanford Medicine, said: 'You can think of the medial entorhinal cortex as containing all the components you need to build a map of space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Before this study, there was extremely limited work on what actually happens to this spatial mapping system during healthy aging.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published Friday in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63229-0"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, looked at 18 mice divided into three categories based on age: three months old, 13 months old and 22 months old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These ages roughly translate to 20-year-old, 50-year-old and 75- to 90-year-old humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers recorded the brain activity of slightly thirsty mice while they ran through virtual reality tracks with a hidden reward, which was a lick of water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The tracks involved running on a stationary ball surrounded by screens displaying a virtual environment, which the team compared to a mouse-sized treadmill in a mouse-sized IMAX theater. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the course of six days, the mice ran through the tracks hundreds of times. By the end of the experiment, mice in all age groups learned where the reward was on a particular track and only stopped at reward locations to lick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As they learned the path, grid cells in their medial entorhinal cortex fired off distinct signals for each track, as if the mice were building custom mental maps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when mice were switched between two tracks they had already learned, each of which had a different reward location, elderly mice had trouble figuring out which track they were on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Giocomo said: 'In this case, the task was more similar to remembering where you parked your car in two different parking lots or where your favorite coffee shop is in two different cities.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The medial entorhinal cortex is pictured above in red. Experts believe it may degrade with aging and conditions like Alzheimer's disease (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This led the older mice to sprint through the rest of the track without stopping to search for rewards. Several even tried licking everywhere instead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the confused older mice, their grid cells fired erratically instead of in the distinct patterns they had adopted when they got used to the tracks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Charlotte Herber, lead study author and MD-PhD student at Stanford Medicine, said: 'Their spatial recall and their rapid discrimination of these two environments was really impaired.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Giocomo likened this to older people with signs of cognitive decline or dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'Older people often can navigate familiar spaces, like their home or the neighborhood they’ve always lived in, but it’s really hard for them to learn to navigate a new place, even with experience.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, younger and middle-aged mice were able to adapt to the changes, and their grid cell activity matched the track they were on within six days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Herber said: 'Over days one through six, they have progressively more stable spatial firing patterns that are specific to context A and specific to context B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The aged mice fail to develop these discrete spatial maps.' &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Middle-aged mice had slightly weaker brain activity patterns, the team found, but they generally performed similarly to young mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Herber said: 'We think this is a cognitive capacity that at least until about 13 months old in a mouse, or maybe 50 to 60 years old in a human counterpart, is probably intact.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said that based on the findings, older mice showed more variability in spatial memory. Male mice also performed better at the tests than female mice, though the team is unsure why. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings suggest the medial entorhinal cortex may be responsible for helping mice maintain mental maps as they age and could be one of the earliest structures to degrade in conditions like Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was partially funded by the National Institutes of Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            Ice cream, mascarpone and milk-washed cocktails may sound like simple pleasures — but the ones served at a two-Michelin-starred restaurant in Denmark contained a little extra something: &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/13/science/iberian-harvester-ants-two-species"&gt;ants&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9i0004356nepv2ruo3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j0005356n7yuepwcl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The restaurant’s ant-ics began when staff noticed that milk started to curdle when a chef left it in a fridge with an ant inside. This led to experiments involving anthropologists, culinary innovators and food scientists, food innovation researcher Nabila Rodríguez Valerón told CNN. She is head of flavor fermentation at Danish food tech company Summ Ingredients (formerly Nutrumami), a former food scientist at Alchemist and coauthor of a study describing the results that was published Friday in the journal &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2025.113595" target="_blank"&gt;iScience&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j0006356nt5x4vzxg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The fermentation of milk into cheese and yogurt dates back about 9,000 years to Anatolia, part of modern-day Turkey, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j0007356nx6zc4x30@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Microbes from natural plants like pine cones and nettles&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;added to the milk would start the fermentation process that turns milk into thick, acidic yogurt.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j0008356n4t3dj0qm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, after microbiologists successfully made yogurt in a lab in the early 1900s, there was a shift from traditional yogurt to a simplified, industrialized version, which only contains two species of lactic acid bacteria, the researchers said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j0009356n21bi6nxf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This makes the yogurt “safe for the high scale that we have to make foods, but the thing about traditional yogurt is they might have some of these two species,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;but they have many others, and that adds to the complexity,” lead study author and biologist Veronica Marie Sinotte, an assistant professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j000b356nmbhw8pi2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers therefore decided to explore a traditional spring practice in Bulgaria of making yogurt using a red wood ant colony, believing that the ants and their microbes could contribute the enzymes and acids needed to kick off fermentation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j000c356n7iaiuhrr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study team visited a village in Bulgaria that was the ancestral home of study coauthor and evolutionary biologist Sandra B. Andersen, associate professor of hologenomics at the University of Copenhagen.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j000d356njy8a89ej@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The community there “only had living memories of” the practice, but they helped the researchers try to make the yogurt several times, Sinotte said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j000e356n6tcipw5b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The team then made a final ant yogurt by milking a cow, warming the milk, pouring the milk into a jar, adding four live ants, covering the jar with a cheesecloth and burying it inside the ant colony, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j000f356nztxaqmnz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While “it was early May, so it was a bit chilly at that time and maybe the fermentation was a little bit slower than normal,” the next day, they found that the milk “was an early stage of yogurt. It had a slight tangy flavor” and had started to thicken, Sinotte said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmgauf585001p356nc06dpbpq@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="tangy-lemony-and-silky" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Tangy, lemony and silky
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j000h356nqg2rxohj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To test how ant yogurt could be used in cooking, the research and development team at Alchemist then created three dishes, using live, frozen and dehydrated ants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j000i356nhz3otlcc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The first was an “ant-wich” ice cream made using sheep yogurt that had been fermented using live ants. The ice cream was sandwiched between ant-shaped cookies with an ant-infused gel, according to the study, which noted that the “ants provided a distinct, pungent acidity that contrasts with the fat of the milk.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j000j356nnojaiu80@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The second was a goat milk “mascarpone,” with dehydrated ants used to start the milk fermentation. While the texture was similar to that of a regular mascarpone, “the flavor was pungent and aromatic, such as a mature pecorino cheese,” the researchers said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j000k356nfk8vkxi7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The final creation was a milk-washed cocktail. Normally, acid from citrus is used to curdle the milk, before the solids are removed to leave a rich drink. Here, however, dehydrated ants were used to induce curdling. The cocktail also contained an apricot liqueur and brandy, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j000l356n9iwwtd0w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The milk-washed cocktail, wow, that was phenomenal. Absolutely incredible, because you got the acidity of the ants, which is lemony but a little bit slightly more complex than lemony,” said Sinotte, adding that the drink had an “amazing silky” flavor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j000m356nmetc7rzs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One microorganism produces some specific aroma compound, but when you use many different ones, like for example, all the microorganisms that ants carry with them, the complexity is like sourdough or, for example, miso or soy sauce,” said study coauthor Valerón.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j000n356nivj8gb1k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A spokesperson for Alchemist told CNN that the “ant-wich” went on to be served in the restaurant for about a year and was “very appreciated” by diners.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j000o356nx8jovsb4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers also did further experiments in the sterile conditions of a lab in Denmark with ants that were the sister species of the ones used in Bulgaria.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j000p356nxmzp45j4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the lab, the team crushed the ants to release more enzymes and microbes, and left the milk for eight hours in warmer conditions than they did in Bulgaria, Sinotte said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j000q356n2ayrt5qi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers found that live ants worked much better than dehydrated and frozen ants as a starter for fermentation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j000r356n4p7czvte@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The live ants consistently introduced lactic acid, as well as acetic acid, to the milk, and the live ant yogurt contained several species of lactic acid bacteria, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j000s356n07kvclly@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the yogurts made with frozen and dehydrated ants, there was not much lactic acid bacteria, but they did contain several species of bacteria known as Bacillaceae, one of which was a food contaminant, the researchers noted. They added that dehydrated and frozen ants and their yogurts are “undesirable” for food fermentation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j000t356njrjoi67c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s one of the most delightful studies I’ve read in a while,” Changqi Liu, a professor in the School of Exercise and Nutritional Sciences at San Diego State University, told CNN. He was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j000u356nkigq96oq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This shows that insects are more than just a novel source of nutrients. They can play a role in transforming and diversifying the way we make food,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j000v356n89eex81p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It also reminds us that traditional practices can reveal new scientific insights when examined closely,” Liu continued, adding: “Personally, I’d love to try ant yogurt as long as it comes without parasites and pathogens.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j000x356nq318azeu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite ant dishes being served at Alchemist, the researchers caution against people making ant yogurt&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;at home, unless they already do so in their culture or are skilled food microbiologists, due to “food safety concerns.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j000y356nzxppztk5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The European red wood ants used in the study can carry a parasite, Dicrocoelium dendriticum, that can be “dangerous” to humans, the researchers said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j000z356nv9yp6fcx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When mixing the live ants with milk, the researchers strained the milk through a filter that allowed bacteria and yeast to move through, but which removed any parasites.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j0010356nb77ud2fb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While freezing can also kill the parasite, freezing and then warming the milk for a long time for fermentation could cause foodborne pathogens to arise, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j0011356nkao3xk4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a very valid concern,” food chemist Andrea Liceaga told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j0012356nfzp6xanj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But, as they mentioned in the study as well, there’s other ways that we can mitigate those safety hazards,” said Liceaga, a professor of food science at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, who was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j0016356ngd8hazv6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The scientists noted that taking their research forward is not simply a case of working out how to scale up ant yogurt production.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;European red wood ants are listed as near-threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature &lt;a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/8644/12924699" target="_blank"&gt;Red List&lt;/a&gt; of Threatened Species.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j0018356n4zt8wv09@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s not really feasible to go harvest a bunch of ants and do this, actually,” Sinotte said. “They’re important and part of the ecosystems. So, what we could think is maybe these ants have actually exciting bacteria in them and we could go collect some of that bacteria and see how it works for fermentation for new types of food.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j001a356npwue60pf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Traditional fermentation “makes a lot of sense,” said Valerón, because using a “huge” community of microorganisms “is much healthier than eating just one strain of bacteria” and is “good for the human gut.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgau7d9j001b356n38ihiw03@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “So I would love to see those kind of fermentation in the future, and I think it’s the way that food systems or (the) food industry should go, with the diversity of different microorganisms,” she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CDC data is based on analyzing wastewater for traces of the virus collected from more than 100 sites across the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 15 states with high levels of Covid were: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Indiana, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were also four states, including Arizona, Delaware, Montana and New York, where cases detected in wastewater had risen compared to the previous week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The uptick comes amid a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15155577/staying-safe-covid-new-strains-surge-stratus-nimbus.html"&gt;surge in Covid infections&lt;/a&gt; in the UK and as the US heads into the fall and winter months when respiratory virus cases surge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What we see is that virus activity in the US and Europe tends to track each other, said Dr Ellerin, who also works at South Shore Hospital in Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So, what we see weeks or months before in Europe, we then see in the US.

Humane Technology, which is struggling to inject ethics into the AI debate. “What is it that is uniquely human? It is our ability to feel, to have an internal experience of being,” he told me. “AI will likely become better at making anything than we can, and it [already] can make better poetry and music and images, or at least more commercially successful ones. But it will never replace the &lt;i&gt;experience&lt;/i&gt; of making music, or the experience of feeling the poetry flow through you and out your fingers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="Text" data-file="custom-template-components/src/Text/Text.js" data-style="stitches" id="NZN4MAGVTRFCVAEEK6LZBOYFCE" data-contentid="NZN4MAGVTRFCVAEEK6LZBOYFCE" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;While extending the hand of friendship, ChatGPT assured me that I had nothing to fear from AI. “Used wisely, AI could actually make us &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; human,” it said, even providing me with a sharp one-liner: “AI won’t decide whether we become more or less human. &lt;i&gt;We will.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="Text" data-file="custom-template-components/src/Text/Text.js" data-style="stitches" id="YOEISU6EB5EVLIYUVNXGG4QSSY" data-contentid="YOEISU6EB5EVLIYUVNXGG4QSSY" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;I asked the machine why it kept using “I,” “we,” “us” and “our” to refer to itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="Text" data-file="custom-template-components/src/Text/Text.js" data-style="stitches" id="4YHOBCMKEBHT3KHBF65YF6U5TQ" data-contentid="4YHOBCMKEBHT3KHBF65YF6U5TQ" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;“Good catch,” ChatGPT answered, then continued referring to itself in the first person. “I used &lt;i&gt;‘we/us/our’ &lt;/i&gt; in that answer because I was framing the explanation from the perspective of humans in general.” The machine went on to admit that “I don’t experience the things that make humans human ... I can describe and analyze them, but I don’t &lt;i&gt;live&lt;/i&gt; them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="Text" data-file="custom-template-components/src/Text/Text.js" data-style="stitches" id="4ZPIEFCFAJGVDHLQJNPFEKRPUE" data-contentid="4ZPIEFCFAJGVDHLQJNPFEKRPUE" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;We feel, therefore we exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="Text" data-file="custom-template-components/src/Text/Text.js" data-style="stitches" id="YEAH5FWQ4RAAJGMHCF77WSQ7DE" data-contentid="YEAH5FWQ4RAAJGMHCF77WSQ7DE" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-gxxVqo-dropcap-true wpds-c-foYyTm-ihVwKVo-css"&gt;Of all the AI engines I asked how I could become more human — ChatGPT, Gemini, Meta AI, Grok and Claude — not one of them came up with what would seem to be the most obvious solution: Stop asking computers how I can become more human. Uniformly, the chatbots would not own up to the harm their creators have done. Meta AI informed me that “social media has both positive and negative impacts on humanity.” Elon Musk’s Grok let me know that “social media’s impact on our sense of humanity is a mixed bag.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="Text" data-file="custom-template-components/src/Text/Text.js" data-style="stitches" id="CTXKFPVSDZG6ZH2HTVJ2VI2WPM" data-contentid="CTXKFPVSDZG6ZH2HTVJ2VI2WPM" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;To its credit, Grok told me I might “consider a digital detox,” citing a study linking excessive social media use with increased anxiety and reduced empathy. But a digital detox would be poison to the AI industry, and even as these chatbots spat out their multi-point how-to-be-human plans, they got to work trying to lure me into deeper engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="Text" data-file="custom-template-components/src/Text/Text.js" data-style="stitches" id="GBNXNFJNHBD6NK3AUEBTPOJTXU" data-contentid="GBNXNFJNHBD6NK3AUEBTPOJTXU" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;“For any of the AIs trained on engagement, their chief competitors are other, human relationships,” Raskin said. “Any time you spend not on the computer talking with a real friend is a time you’re not spending in relationships with one of these AIs.” He added: “When the companies say we’re going to solve loneliness, actually what they’re creating is a very different type of loneliness, where it’s replacing human beings with machines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="Text" data-file="custom-template-components/src/Text/Text.js" data-style="stitches" id="BDMNQIC7NVE4LI56N6P76QXIHQ" data-contentid="BDMNQIC7NVE4LI56N6P76QXIHQ" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;In the short run, people are going to feel “seen” and “heard.” They will share intimate details of their lives with machines. And, ultimately, they may lose their real human relationships — because that is the cynical business model. That model will achieve this destruction while simultaneously displacing perhaps 1 billion people from their jobs over the next several years, undermining the self-worth of all those human beings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="Text" data-file="custom-template-components/src/Text/Text.js" data-style="stitches" id="IO3U7KDTLRASTFN2K4BECLG37U" data-contentid="IO3U7KDTLRASTFN2K4BECLG37U" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;It doesn’t have to be this way.

But for the adventurous, the menu may be about to get wilder. How about a spoonful of ant yoghurt?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Making it does not involve milking any ants. Instead, the unfortunate insects are dropped into a jar of warm milk, which is tucked into an ant mound and left to ferment overnight. The fermenting tradition originating from Turkey and Bulgaria is now being resurrected in the name of science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Veronica Sinotte and her colleagues at the University of Copenhagen became interested in the practice after being approached by research and development chefs at the city’s two-Michelin-starred restaurant the Alchemist in the hope of learning more about how this fermentation process worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Ants are a somewhat commonly used ingredient in high-end gastronomy in Copenhagen. They’re an ingredient chefs like to play with,” said Dr Leonie Jahn, a senior researcher at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Centre for Biosustainability in Lyngby, who supervised the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The [former] head of Alchemist’s R&amp;amp;D was very keen on science-driven food innovation and quite excited about the acidity of the ants.

Though the villagers no longer made ant yoghurt themselves, some remembered older generations’ methods and helped reconstruct a makeshift recipe: milk a cow, warm the milk until it “bites” your finger, add four red wood ants, cover with cheesecloth and bury the pot in an ant mound overnight. The mound provides warmth, and possibly additional microbes that fall in through the cheesecloth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The next day, Sinotte sampled the results: “It was at this early stage of a nice yoghurt – fermentation was dropping the acidity and there were some tiny flavours and herbaceous notes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Back in the laboratory, the team ran further experiments under controlled conditions, using a related red wood ant found in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/denmark" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;. According to Sinotte, this yoghurt tasted a little different – it was thicker, with more lemony notes – perhaps because of differences in the quantity and composition of the ant starter culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Their findings, which are published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)01856-5" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;iScience&lt;/a&gt;, suggest the fermentation is a collaborative process between ant and microbe: the insects’ formic acid lowers the milk’s pH, enabling their acid-loving microbes to thrive, while ant or bacterial enzymes break down milk proteins to produce a yoghurt. Notably, only live ants had the correct microbial community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f29dfaed-c910-43a8-8f7d-0e22471c52ca" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;The findings of the Danish research suggest the fermentation is a collaborative process between ant and microbe.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As a keen “fermentista”, I found the urge to try making my own ant yoghurt hard to resist. Sinotte and colleagues advise against this: some ants can carry a parasite, a type of liver fluke that is harmful to humans. Plus, red wood ant numbers are declining across wide parts of Europe, making large-scale harvesting of the insect unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I spent a good hour fretting over the ethics, but curiosity won out – helped by finding a supplier that funds red wood ant reintroductions. With a relative experienced in ant-keeping to care for my remaining colony, I also hoped to offset the loss of the four ants I planned to sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Adapting the methodology from Sinotte’s iScience paper, I sterilised a pestle and mortar, heated 30ml of milk to 42C, added four crushed ants, then strained the mixture through a microbiology-grade sieve to remove any parasites or ant fragments, before incubating it in my regular yoghurt maker overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The result was a gelatinous yoghurt, with a surprisingly creamy taste. I did not detect any lemony notes, just a mild bitterness. It was actually rather nice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Curiosity aside, such experiments could give rise to practical applications. The researchers believe microbes from ants could serve as a toolkit for creating new foods such as plant-based yoghurts, or introducing novel flavours to existing ones such as sourdough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Martin Blaser, a human microbiome expert at Rutgers University in the US, said he was excited by the research. “One consequence of the worldwide popularity of yoghurt is that there are a few industrial strains [of bacteria] that dominate yoghurt making,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Nutritionally, my guess is that ant yoghurt is more or less equivalent to industrially produced yoghurt. But for the discerning, this kind of approach could possibly broaden our repertoire of foods, giving us interesting and unique tastes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ants are not the only unusual ingredient historically used to make yoghurt. In Turkey and other countries, people have traditionally used plant material such as pinecones, chamomile and linden flowers, or nettle roots to kickstart yoghurt fermentations. Investigating these approaches could impart further textures or flavours – with the added benefit of leaving ants unharmed. Nettle yoghurt for breakfast, anyone?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 14:34:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxNVTdxbEw0MkhsUi1waUtDTHR2UXlYY05BeXlEa0cxQ1NuN2JkZ0xvR0w2Qm5BNEtIbTdoU2FVS2tNcWo2ZWNFUWM1dkhoUlJ5eEpVVkdPUjA1RmNVekxTYjNfU2YtVG1BVWNnbE9WaXlMdXpha29tSzN3bXZNMHlDSHlYTzhEa3gwX002cmhR</guid></item><item><title>根据引人入胜的新心理学研究- PsyPost ，您对响度的感知与您所知道的相符</title><link>https://www.psypost.org/your-perception-of-loudness-bends-to-what-you-know-according-to-fascinating-new-psychology-research/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5334/joc.445" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Journal of Cognition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; provides evidence that what we know influences what we hear. Researchers found that when people listened to pairs of words and nonsense words spoken at the same volume, they tended to judge the real words as louder. This perceptual bias appeared not only in a person’s native language but also in their second language, although with some differences in strength. The findings suggest that familiarity with language can shape basic aspects of auditory perception, such as loudness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were interested in whether a previously documented visual illusion—where familiar letters and words are perceived as physically larger than unfamiliar combinations—also occurs with sound. In other words, could the brain treat known words as perceptually “louder” in the same way it treats them as visually “taller,” even when there is no physical difference?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This question connects to larger theories in cognitive science about how perception is influenced by prior knowledge. In particular, models of language processing suggest that top-down processes, like recognizing a word, can shape the way basic sensory features are experienced. The team wanted to know whether this effect could cross sensory boundaries, extending from vision into hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also wanted to test whether this effect depends on how familiar someone is with the language. For example, would a person hear a native-language word as louder than a foreign one? And would the effect be weaker when listening to a second language, where vocabulary is less deeply ingrained?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were inspired by earlier findings of the word/letter height superiority illusion in vision (New et al., 2016), where letters and words are perceived as taller than pseudoletters or pseudowords (letter strings that follow the orthographic and phonotactic rules of a language but have no meaning, e.g., wug) of the same size,” said study author Boris New, a professor in cognitive psychology at the Université Savoie Mont Blanc, LPNC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to know whether this illusion was specific to reading (and perhaps to the visual word form area) or whether it reflected a more general cognitive mechanism that could also be observed in other modalities like audition. The study connects also to an everyday phenomenon – many people feel they need to ‘turn up the volume’ when watching movies in a foreign language. We wanted to test whether this subjective experience has a perceptual basis: do words in a familiar language actually feel louder than in a less familiar one, even when their physical intensity is identical?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers ran two experiments. In the first, they recruited 77 native French speakers who also spoke English as a second language. In the second, they tested 89 native English speakers who had some knowledge of French.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants listened to pairs of audio clips in which two spoken items—a real word or a nonsense word made by swapping the syllables of a real word—were played one after the other. The key trials involved pairs where the two items were played at exactly the same volume, yet one was a real word and the other was not. The participants’ task was to decide which of the two items sounded louder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nonsense words were carefully constructed to resemble real words in terms of their syllable structure and length, but they lacked meaning. This allowed the researchers to control for acoustic features and focus on the effect of lexical familiarity. The sounds were presented in both the participants’ native and second languages, with the language blocks counterbalanced to avoid order effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants first completed a headphone check and a calibration step to ensure consistent listening conditions. Then they practiced with example trials to familiarize themselves with the task. The full experiment involved several trials in which the words varied in their actual volume or were equal in volume. The key measure was whether, in trials where the volume was objectively the same, participants were more likely to say the real word sounded louder than the nonsense word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Experiment 1, the French-speaking participants showed a clear pattern. When real words and nonsense words were played at the same volume, they were significantly more likely to judge the real words as louder. This happened in both their native French and their second language, English. However, the effect was stronger in their native language. When errors were made in identifying which item was louder, over 70 percent of those errors favored the real word in French, compared to about 59 percent in English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiment 2 replicated the basic finding with a different group: native English speakers. These participants also showed a bias to hear real words as louder than nonsense words. Interestingly, though, the strength of the effect was similar in both their native English and their second language, French.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We expected the illusion (words being perceived as louder than pseudowords) to be stronger in the native language (L1) than in the second language (L2) for both groups,” New told PsyPost. “That’s what we found with French participants (illusion was stronger in French than in English). But for English participants, the pattern was different: the illusion was present in both English (L1) and French (L2), but the strength was about the same in both languages, not stronger in L1 as predicted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was surprising because it went against the initial hypothesis. We think it might be due to how the stimuli were created: syllables were concatenated, which disrupted natural stress patterns, a crucial cue in English but less so in French. That could have weakened the ‘native-language boost’ for English listeners.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team examined whether differences in second-language proficiency could explain this asymmetry. Data showed that French speakers reported using English more frequently and rated themselves as more proficient in it than English speakers did with French. This suggests that the level of experience with a language might influence the strength of top-down processing effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these findings suggest that language knowledge influences perception in a direct way. Words that are familiar to the listener are more likely to be perceived as louder than nonsense words, even when there is no actual difference in volume. This provides support for theories that top-down processes—where knowledge and expectations feed back into early sensory processing—can shape how we perceive the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The key takeaway is that our brains don’t just passively register sounds – what we know and recognize shapes how we hear them,” New explained. “Words we know are literally perceived as louder than nonsense words, even when the physical volume is the same.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So the big message is: familiarity with language changes how we actually perceive sound intensity, our knowledge literally shapes our perception. Readers should think of the effect as modest in size but revealing of an important principle: the brain’s expectations and knowledge can change how loud something feels. The illusion is subtle, not dramatic; the effect is a small perceptual bias. So it’s not that your ears are changing physics, it’s that your brain’s language system nudges your perception.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the study, like all research, has some limitations. The stimuli were synthetic and constructed from individual syllables, which may have disrupted natural speech rhythm, especially in English. Future studies could explore whether the illusion holds with naturally spoken words and across a wider range of languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The task was also demanding, and the experiment was designed to be completed in under 20 minutes, which limited the number of test words. Expanding the range of stimuli would help confirm whether the effect generalizes beyond the specific examples used here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individual differences in hearing sensitivity were not directly measured. Although participants adjusted their listening volume at the start of the study, this method relies on self-assessment and may not capture subtle differences in auditory processing. Future work could include more precise hearing tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another avenue for research would be to test this auditory illusion in other syllable-timed languages. If the effect varies across languages, it might reveal how speech rhythm and lexical familiarity interact in shaping perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We would like to replicate the experiment in other syllable-timed languages like Italian, to see if the illusion generalizes the same way it does in French,” New told PsyPost. “Our study helps explain a very common experience, why people often feel the need to turn up the volume when listening to a foreign language. It shows that this isn’t just about effort or attention, but about how our brain’s familiarity with words literally changes perception.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.445" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Listening to Foreign Languages: Pump Up the Volume!&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Boris New, Clément Guichet, Elsa Spinelli, and Julien Barra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 14:14:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxNUE9SdzRremZLdlZmNTJCeDJEbm5ZMlZoWFRFQkhlTnBGRjhRVmRVMkFSaEJwczRvTkE5NWEzTkRsRXh3NzIyT3BBUVpRLUV1VURKb2dHZG9ybWpWb3VTVGM1X2FUTEdTbDFEeXNzdUpZZ3loZWRIRHRTZzBycFlfZjVTajZuV3JIU0lZRU5XTVpMM1dWRE5vc2lYNTFLQXlqZmQ5Y1FGenZhQnBzblVETUs0MWRfNzdFY1B5M3hobElGdw</guid></item><item><title>亲爱的安妮：我无法接我1岁的曾孙，因为她的父母喂她太多了- NJ.com</title><link>https://www.nj.com/advice/2025/10/best-of-dear-annie-i-cant-pick-up-my-1-year-old-great-grandchild-because-her-parents-feed-her-so-much.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="56ZIJA2TNZBHFBODDOCDDXNFFA"&gt;DEAR ANNIE: My grandson married a lovely girl who we are crazy about.

James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute (OSUCCC - James) report key findings about the underlying mechanisms of immune system stress response to protein misfolding, launching a new approach to cancer immunotherapy treatment targeting the protein production cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this study, OSUCCC - James researchers sought to answer a long-held question: Why do T cells, which are crucial for fighting infections and recognizing cancer, sometimes become "exhausted" and lose their effectiveness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this comprehensive preclinical study, researchers revealed a hidden vulnerability in exhausted T cells: they are overwhelmed by misfolded proteins that ignite a previously unrecognized stress pathway, now named TexPSR (proteotoxic stress response in T-cell exhaustion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike ordinary stress responses that slow protein production to help cells regain balance, TexPSR drives protein synthesis into overdrive. The result is a relentless buildup of misfolded proteins, stress granules, and toxic aggregates ¾ similar to the amyloid plaques seen in Alzheimer's disease. This overload poisons the T cells, crippling their ability to attack tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Reviews Immunology&lt;/em&gt;, a leading opinion journal in the field, described this phenomenon as a "proteotoxic shock." Strikingly, when researchers blocked key drivers of TexPSR in preclinical models, exhausted T cells recovered their function and cancer immunotherapy became markedly more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"T-cell exhaustion is the biggest roadblock to cancer immunotherapy. Our study results present a surprising and exciting answer to this fundamental problem and could be critical to improving future scientific advances in the field of engineered cancer drug therapies to harness the immune system," said Zihai Li, MD, PhD, senior study author and founding director of the Pelotonia Institute for Immuno-oncology (PIIO) at the OSUCCC - James.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li, who also serves as Deputy Director for Translational Research at the OSUCCC - James and holds the Klotz Memorial Chair in Cancer Research, has studied the link between protein folding and immunity for over three decades. He emphasized: "Researchers worldwide are tackling T-cell exhaustion through studying genetics, epigenetics, metabolism and others, but the role of protein quality control has been largely overlooked -- until now."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ohio State cancer research team also found that high levels of TexPSR in T cells from cancer patients were linked to poor clinical responses to immunotherapy. This suggests that targeting TexPSR could be a new way to enhance cancer treatment in the clinics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When T cells become exhausted, they continue creating molecular weapons but then destroy the weapons before they can do their job," said Yi Wang, first author and doctoral student in Li's laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team's findings reveal that this self-perpetuating cycle of protein stress is a central driver of T-cell exhaustion, ultimately disabling the function of these immune cells. Notably, the mechanism was validated in multiple preclinical and clinical cancer models -- including lung, bladder, liver cancer, and leukemia -- highlighting its broad relevance across diverse cancer types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li and colleagues report their findings in the latest issue of &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The procedure — the first of its kind — could improve access to donor organs, specialists say, because the blood type of the donor would no longer matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, organs from deceased donors can be transplanted into people only if they have a compatible blood type. This is because the recipient’s immune system can produce antibodies to attack and destroy the donated organ if the donor and recipient have different antigens, which come in two types: A and B. Organs that are blood type O do not have &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2007/070326/full/news070326-17.html" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/news/2007/070326/full/news070326-17.html" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;A or B antigens&lt;/a&gt;, so anyone can receive them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Canada and China used an enzyme to remove type-A antigens from a donor kidney&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The enzyme converts type-A blood into type-O, says study author Stephen Withers, a chemist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. The type-O kidney was then transplanted into a 68-year-old brain-dead man in Chongqing, China. The organ remained healthy for two days before showing signs of rejection. It produced urine for six days. The results are published in &lt;i&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/i&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enzyme was first identified in 2019 by some members of the same team&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In 2022, they showed that a type-A lung could be converted into a type-O one&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, although the organ wasn’t transplanted into a person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results are groundbreaking, says Natasha Rogers, a transplant clinician at Westmead Hospital in Sydney, Australia. They could improve &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01453-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01453-2" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;access to donor organs&lt;/a&gt; and reduce transplant wait lists. If the blood type of the organ was no longer a barrier for transplantation, physicians could focus on things such as matching other antigens unrelated to blood type, which are important in terms of how long a transplant will last, she adds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Exclusion criteria included any history of neurological or psychiatric disorders, head injuries, surgeries, brain tumors, current medication use, or more than five hours of video gaming per week in the prior six months, especially RTS or FPS games. Only participants who completed both sessions and met training requirements were included. Each eligible participant received compensation of approximately 184 USD. Participants engaged in StarCraft II gaming sessions in a controlled laboratory environment at the NeuroCognitive Research Center, SWPS University in Warsaw. Before the first session, each participant completed an introductory training session with a StarCraft II coach to familiarize them with the game’s core concepts and basic mechanics. The training lasted 30 hours in total, spread over 3 to 4 weeks, with participants playing between 5 and 10 hours per week. Telemetric variables were extracted from StarCraft II replays using the Python libraries sc2reader (available at &lt;a href="https://github.com/ggtracker/sc2reader"&gt;https://github.com/ggtracker/sc2reader&lt;/a&gt;) and PACanalyzer (available at &lt;a href="https://github.com/Reithan/PACAnalyzer"&gt;https://github.com/Reithan/PACAnalyzer&lt;/a&gt;), which enable the retrieval of information from various StarCraft II resources.

APM reflects cognitive, motor, and decision-making speed, increasing as participants gain experience. EEG data were collected during two lab sessions lasting up to two hours each, which included instructions, electrode setup, and an attentional blink task. Only those who completed both sessions and met the training requirements were included in the final analysis. The attentional blink task involved rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of letters at the center of the screen. Participants were instructed to detect and report two target letters (T1 and T2) appearing in the stream, with T2 occurring shortly after T1, to measure the transient lapse in attention characteristic of the attentional blink effect. T1 corresponded to a green capital letter (vowel or consonant), and T2 to a black “X” presented at lag 1, 2, or 7 after T1. Participants answered two yes/no questions: whether a vowel (T1) and/or an “X” (T2) appeared. From the test, we reported the T1 and T2 reaction times and accuracy. EEG recordings were acquired before and after 30 hours of training. The total playing time was monitored, and participants were strictly prohibited from playing outside the lab.

In the gaming expertise design, the model was fitted to a subsample of age-matched participants from the training data (24.5 ± 1.0 years). The simulated functional connectivity matrices and G values were used for subsequent analyses. We validated our results by comparing the BAGs between expert and non-expert video game players across different values of G, finding consistent results across the entire parameter range (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41467-025-64173-9#MOESM1"&gt;S3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41467-025-64173-9#MOESM1"&gt;S6&lt;/a&gt; in Supplementary Information). For the remaining groups, we used the average structural connectivity matrix across participants of the gaming expertise design (average across experts and non-experts). We then fitted individual G values using participants’ empirical functional connectivity matrices. The results of the model fitting are presented in Figs. S4, 5 in Supplementary Information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec24"&gt;Statistical analyses and visualization&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pairwise t-tests for independent samples (expertise) and paired t-tests (pre/post-learning) with a p-value of 0.05 were used to determine significance, plus the 95% confidence intervals and degrees of freedom. Cohen’s D was calculated to provide effect sizes, with values interpreted as small (0.2 &amp;lt; |D| &amp;lt; 0.5), moderate (0.5 &amp;lt;| D| &amp;lt;0.8), large (0.8 &amp;lt; |D| &amp;lt;1.2), and huge (|D| &amp;gt; 1.2).

For categorical variables, like sex, we proceeded with Chi-squared tests. Pearson’s correlation was used to assess statistical relationships, and all p-values from multiple correlations were corrected for false discovery rate (FDR) using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.

For the tango dancers, musicians, and visual artists groups, we used the EEG-derived age vulnerability maps; for the gaming group, the age vulnerability map was constructed using MEG data from musicians and non-musicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensitivity analysis 4: We investigated whether the BAGs are associated with domain-specific expertise levels. Participants were classified as BAG-younger or BAG-older based on the overall BAG distribution, merging experts and non-experts. Specifically, individuals with BAG values below the 35th percentile were labeled as BAG-younger, while those above the 65th percentile were labeled as BAG-older. We then compared expertise scores between these two groups using one-sided Mann-Whitney U tests and FDR correction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensitivity analysis 5: To assess the impact of channel density on model performance, we computed the slope of predicted versus chronological age using linear regression, separately for 64- and 128-channel EEG datasets, in both the training and creativity datasets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec26"&gt;Reporting summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further information on research design is available in the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41467-025-64173-9#MOESM2"&gt;Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary&lt;/a&gt; linked to this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 12:23:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE9RaEFwX0FfWnZjc1pUSFRwdDN1cjE3NmNTSEFRWkZHNzdWeDRSOWZ4a29YbG5MbV9zbXNnZi1zakp3NjhiTkJBT1hPa092aFRtaDg2c29LRFc5RGdmLTFz</guid></item><item><title>糖尿病药物显示出治疗酒精使用障碍的承诺- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-10-diabetes-drugs-treatment-alcohol-disorder.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The excessive and uncontrolled consumption of alcohol, which can culminate in the development of alcohol use disorder or alcoholism, is widespread in many countries worldwide. Individuals diagnosed with alcohol use disorder are often also experiencing other mental health conditions, such as depression or anxiety. Moreover, the excessive use of alcohol is known to increase the risk of developing liver disease and some other health-related problems.&lt;/p&gt;

Identifying effective new treatments could thus be highly valuable, as it could help to treat a wider range of patients, potentially limiting the detrimental effects of alcohol on their mental and physical health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some studies have gathered evidence suggesting that gut hormones, particularly glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), could act on both people's metabolism and their addictive tendencies. These hormones have so far been primarily used to treat obesity and diabetes, as they can help to control blood sugar levels, appetite and body weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism in the U.S. recently performed a large-scale analysis of genetic data, aimed at further exploring the potential of these hormones as therapeutic tools to limit &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/excessive+drinking/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;excessive drinking&lt;/a&gt; and improve liver health. Their findings, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03199-3" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/i&gt;, suggest that GLP-1 and GIP-based drugs could in fact help to reduce people's intake of alcohol, which could inform the future development of alternative treatments for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/alcohol+use+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;alcohol use disorder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"Pharmacological modulation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) through dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists, commonly used for diabetes and obesity, shows promise in reducing alcohol consumption," wrote Joshua Reitz, Daniel B. Rosoff and their colleagues in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We applied drug-target Mendelian randomization (MR) using &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+variation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic variation&lt;/a&gt; at these loci to assess their long-term effects on problematic alcohol use (PAU), &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/binge+drinking/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;binge drinking&lt;/a&gt;, alcohol misuse classifications, liver health, and other substance use behaviors."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of their study, Reitz, Rosoff and their colleagues analyzed large amounts of bio-genetic data taken from two large databases, the UK Biobank and the Million Veterans Program dataset. They analyzed this data using a technique known as Mendelian randomization, which can be used to explore the link between &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/specific+genes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;specific genes&lt;/a&gt; and the effects of drugs or the unfolding of biological processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Genetic proxies for lowered BMI, modeling the appetite-suppressing and weight-reducing effects of variants in both the GIPR and GLP1R loci ("GIPR/GLP1R"), were linked with reduced binge drinking in the primary (β = −0.44, 95% CI [−0.72, −0.15], P = 2.42 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;) and replication data (β = −0.13, [−0.22, −0.04], P = 0.0058)," wrote Reitz, Rosoff and their colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"HbA1c lowering via GIPR/GLP1R variants was associated with reduced risk of heavy drinking with psychiatric comorbidities versus low-risk drinking (odds ratio [OR] = 0.62, [0.45, 0.85], P = 0.0031), with replication in independent HbA1c data (OR = 0.71, [0.60, 0.84], P = 5.22 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;) and directional consistency with reduced PAU. Analysis of individual loci indicated that both GIPR and GLP1R were protective against heavy drinking, underscoring the importance of both targets."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the researchers found that naturally occurring differences in the expression of GLP1R and GIPR genes, which the drugs GLP-1 and GIP act on, were linked to a lower consumption of alcohol. In contrast, these differences were not found to be associated with the intake of tobacco, cannabis or opioids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While estimates for other substance use disorders (tobacco, cannabis, opioid) were consistently null, food preference analyses revealed that BMI lowering via GIPR/GLP1R reduced fatty food liking (β = −1.58, [−2.01, −1.14], P = 1.62 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;) and increased vegetarian food liking (β = 2.08, [1.17, 2.99], P = 8.22 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;), implicating metabolic and appetite regulation pathways for the alcohol consumption findings," wrote the authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For liver health, HbA1c lowering via GIPR/GLP1R was associated with reduced NAFLD (β = −0.34, [−0.50, −0.18], P = 2.74 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;) and lower ALT levels (β = −0.26, [−0.38, −0.15], P = 8.39 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;), with replication supporting these findings. Consistency across multiple MR methods and colocalization analyses strengthened causal inference."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The GLP1R and GIPR gene-related patterns identified by the researchers were found to be connected not only to a lower consumption of alcohol but also to a preference for less fatty foods, such as vegetarian or lean options. This suggests that drugs acting on GLP1R and GIPR receptors, such as GLP-1 and GIP, could influence both people's appetite and their cravings for alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Mediation analysis suggested reductions in hazardous alcohol consumption partially explain the cardioprotective effects of these agonists," wrote Reitz, Rosoff and their colleagues. "Multi-ancestry analyses supported directionally aligned relationships in non-European cohorts."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this study did not directly assess the effects of GLP-1 and GIP, it suggests that the receptors affected by these drugs play a role in alcohol consumption. In the future, it could thus pave the way for clinical trials assessing the potential of these drugs for the treatment of alcohol use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

In minutes, AI can design thousands of chemical compounds with potential antibacterial properties, although there are hurdles to overcome before the first of these medicines can be tested in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the US Centers for Disease Control &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdc-report-finds-sharp-rise-in-dangerous-drug-resistant-bacteria.html" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdc-report-finds-sharp-rise-in-dangerous-drug-resistant-bacteria.html" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that rates of dangerous bacterial infections surged by 69% between 2019 and 2023. Enterobacterales bacteria, also called 'nightmare bacteria', are particularly difficult to treat with existing antibiotics. Globally, 1.1 million deaths a year are linked to bacterial resistance to antimicrobial drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The standard method of antibiotic discovery involves going into nature and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00945-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00945-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;sifting through dirt&lt;/a&gt; to find antibacterial compounds, says César de la Fuente, a machine biologist at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. “That’s really painstaking work that relies on trial and error, and it can take many years,” he adds. His team has been using AI to discover antibiotics for about a decade. The whole process of discovering a candidate, creating it in the laboratory and testing it in cells can be done “within a week or two”, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most AI-designed antibiotics are still in early development. None has yet been tested in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;AI-designed drugs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00945-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00945-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Machine learning&lt;/a&gt; and generative AI (genAI) can speed up the process. De la Fuente and his team train machine-learning algorithms by showing them compounds that can harm bacteria, and others that cannot. The AI designs antibiotics by looking for fragments of proteins with antibacterial properties in data sets that it has not seen before. These include the proteomes — the complete set of proteins that an organism can express — of animals, plants and bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GenAI algorithms — similar to the AI used in chatbots or image generators — are trained on the same data but designed to create new compounds. Earlier this month, de la Fuente and his team reported that their genAI model designed 50,000 peptides, or short chains of amino acids, that have antimicrobial properties and can destroy pathogens&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. A deep-learning model then ranked these on the basis of how effective it thinks they might be at killing several bacteria types. Of the top 46 synthesized peptides, about 35 killed at least one bacterial strain in a dish, and most were not toxic to human embryonic kidney cells. The top two candidates were then tested and found to be effective against &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt; in mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Challenges ahead&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But making AI-designed antibiotics in the lab can be challenging. For example, bioengineer Jim Collins, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, has found that some AI-designed antibiotics are chemically unstable and cannot be synthesized. Others take too many steps to make and would be too costly and time-consuming to produce commercially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

At Chester Zoo alone, seven baby elephants have died of it over the last decade. It has also been found in wild elephant herds and in some sanctuaries and elephant orphanages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;It causes a haemorrhagic disease - uncontrolled bleeding that can be fatal within 24 hours. It results in death in more than 80% of cases in juvenile elephants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Why EEHV can be so dangerous is still unknown. Many adult elephants carry the virus - apparently with no negative impact on their health. But it is thought that young calves are particularly vulnerable when they are being weaned, and when the immune-boosting antibodies from the mother's milk decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;At this stage, a calf's immune system is in a delicate balance and it can become overwhelmed. "It can cause really severe disease," Dr Katie Edwards, lead conservation scientist at Chester Zoo told BBC News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"It does affect wild elephants, but we don't have an exact number of how many deaths in total it has caused.

None of the children had received the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. It was unclear, however, whether the patients were old enough to qualify for the shots, usually given in two doses starting around age 1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eea878" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, too, is dealing with a large, growing outbreak that has spread across the area bordering southwestern Utah. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a5e75d" class="body-graf"&gt;Fifty-nine cases have been confirmed in Arizona, with one hospitalization.

Five needed to be admitted to the hospital but have since recovered, Heaton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6e4aca" class="body-graf"&gt;If outbreaks continue around the country until the end of January, the United States will lose its status of having had &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-cases-reach-highest-point-disease-was-eliminated-us-2000-rcna201421" target="_blank"&gt;eliminated measles&lt;/a&gt; 25 years ago.

Like all organ transplants, however, it is somewhat limited by the need to match the blood type of the donor with that of the recipient, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://unos.org/transplant/frequently-asked-questions/#Waiting" target="_blank" data-url="https://unos.org/transplant/frequently-asked-questions/#Waiting" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;along with the requirement to find&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; an appropriately sized organ that's geographically close enough to transplant in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans have four major &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/heart-circulation/how-many-blood-types-are-there" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/heart-circulation/how-many-blood-types-are-there"&gt;&lt;u&gt;blood groups&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — A, B, AB and O — and the immune system of a person with one blood type may react against another type. For example, a transplant candidate with type O blood can only receive a type-O donor kidney, but someone with A, B or AB blood type can also receive a type O kidney. That's because each blood type is &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-types.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-types.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;defined by immune-triggering substances&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, called antigens. O blood lacks these antigens, so it can be given universally, while other blood types would set off a type-O person's immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in the late 1980s, scientists developed a way to transplant ABO-incompatible (ABOi) organs — an organ from a donor with one blood type into a donor with an incompatible blood type — into recipients who needed them. But the process is demanding and takes several days. Then, in 2022, researchers developed an &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/universal-blood-type-transplant-lungs-study" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/universal-blood-type-transplant-lungs-study"&gt;&lt;u&gt;enzyme-based treatment protocol&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that can convert an organ into a "universal" transplant called enzyme-converted O, or ECO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ECO process has been demonstrated for lungs," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.chem.ubc.ca/stephen-withers" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.chem.ubc.ca/stephen-withers" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Stephen Withers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor emeritus of biochemistry at the University of British Columbia, told Live Science in an email.

In the new study, Withers and colleagues used a type-A kidney that had been deemed unsuitable for transplantation and converted it to a type-O kidney by perfusing the kidney with a special fluid, which took about two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Perfusion devices and organ preservation solutions are &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/how-long-can-donated-organs-last-before-transplant.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/how-long-can-donated-organs-last-before-transplant.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;quite commonly used to keep organs in good condition&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; between donation and transplantation," Withers explained. To convert the organ, the researchers put specific enzymes into the perfusion fluid that removed the blood-group antigens that can cause rejection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In this way, organs will not then get recognized and targeted by the anti-A antibodies present in the blood stream of the recipient," Withers said. The procedure doesn't permanently rid the organ of problematic antigens, but it could help stave off the worst of the immune system's reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see whether the kidney could escape immediate rejection in a human, the team turned to a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/brain-death-irreversible" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/brain-death-irreversible"&gt;&lt;u&gt;brain-dead&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recipient whose family consented to the study. The team transplanted the ECO kidney into the recipient, who carried a high quantity of anti-A antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a typical transplant, antibody therapy is given to the recipient before and after the transplant to prevent "hyperacute" rejection, which happens quickly. But the research team wanted to test whether creating an ECO kidney would prevent early rejection, so they didn't apply this therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We needed to understand how things progressed," Withers said. They wanted to monitor the rate at which antigens reappeared in the kidney and for how long the recipient's body could tolerate that reappearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the ECO kidney worked well for two days following transplantation, with no signs of rejection. Immune responses to the new kidney appeared on day three, which is when the ECO kidney began creating new A antigens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In an actual clinical transplant, there are a number of procedures that can be applied to minimize initial antibody-mediated rejection, including optimized immunosuppression," Withers said. If these methods, which are standard care in any organ transplant, are also used for ECO kidneys, this could enable longer-term tolerance of the transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b6b9092b-84aa-40f7-882a-52ec6b918eb7"&gt;Converting organs from one blood type to another is important for increasing patients' access to donor organs, the researchers wrote in the study. This is particularly important for "type-O transplant candidates, who constitute over 50% of the waiting list and typically wait 2-4 years longer than do other blood types," they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the ECO kidney was successfully transplanted, the development of this transplant process is still in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do not know whether this will be applied universally," Withers said. "However, it is certainly a possibility."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="e2433f54-862b-4ec3-8f0c-c8fac1e1bebc"&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-by-jennifer-fernandez"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Jennifer Fernandez&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people likely know pertussis by its more common name — whooping cough, which comes from the “whoop” sound made as the person tries to catch their breath in between violent coughing spells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Corbin family in Chapel Hill is well acquainted with the other nickname for pertussis — the “100-day cough.” Earlier this year, 11-year-old Alex Corbin spent at least two months struggling with a cough that made him vomit, kept him up at night and left him breathless. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Months later, he still suffers from coughing fits, although they are nowhere near the intensity they were initially, said his mother, Jennifer Corbin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spate of whooping cough cases cropped up at Alex’s elementary school at the end of last school year, Corbin said. She was surprised when Alex became sick because he was vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="wp-block-group has-light-gray-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-group"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;
&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-whooping-cough-vaccine-schedule"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whooping cough vaccine schedule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because whooping cough is caused by a bacteria, not a virus, people need more frequent vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, kids should receive boosters on this schedule:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Babies &lt;/strong&gt;need three shots to combat diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) to build up high levels of protection. That means a shot at 2 months, 4 months and 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Young children &lt;/strong&gt;need two booster shots of DTaP between 15 and 18 months and between 4 and 6 years to maintain that protection through early childhood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preteens and teens &lt;/strong&gt;should get one shot of Tdap (a different formulation of vaccines against all three diseases) between the ages of 11 and 12 years to boost their immunity. Teens who didn’t get Tdap as a preteen should get one shot the next time they visit their health care provider.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/vaccines/recommendations.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cases are climbing across the state, including in Buncombe County in western North Carolina, and some of that is likely due to waning immunity in vaccinated kids, according to county health officials. They said&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the vaccine starts to wane around ages 3 to 4 and again around ages 9 to 10 years old, before children typically get the next booster shot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buncombe County had 84 whooping cough cases as of about mid-September 2025. That’s already higher than the 77 cases for all of 2024, said Nicole Santamaria, the county’s lead communicable disease nurse. The previous four years averaged six cases a year, &lt;a href="https://www.buncombenc.gov/civicalerts.aspx?aid=366" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Buncombe County officials said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The highly contagious respiratory illness rises and falls in cycles as vaccines wear off and new children are born without immunity, experts said. It is on an upswing, with &lt;a href="https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2024/12/03/whooping-cough-cases-spike-in-n-c/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cases rising across the state and nation the past two years&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With masking and isolating from the pandemic no longer common, whooping cough returned at levels not seen in 70 years, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services &lt;a href="https://www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/2025/08/04/back-school-means-time-get-children-date-required-and-recommended-vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;said in an Aug. 4 news release&lt;/a&gt; that encouraged families to get children vaccinated before school started this fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s always creeping out there a little bit,” said Susan Creede, nurse supervisor for Buncombe County’s communicable disease team. “But when we hit these big outbreaks … the spread is just so very hard to control.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-whooping-cough"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is whooping cough?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before a vaccine was developed in the 1940s, whooping cough was one of the most common childhood diseases and a major cause of death in children. With the introduction of a vaccine, cases began to drop from 200,000 annually to fewer than 19,000 in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whooping cough is caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis, and it causes an infection that can be life-threatening, particularly for infants. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Babies are particularly vulnerable because of their small airways — smaller than the width of a pinkie finger — which can collapse after a bout of coughing. Babies also get sick with whooping cough at higher rates than older children. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rate among North Carolina infants is 2.6 times higher than school-aged children this year, NCDHHS said. There are 51.1 infant cases of whooping cough per 100,000 North Carolinians compared with 20 cases in school-aged children per 100,000 residents, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Babies, especially, can die,” Creede said. “They can barely suck, swallow and breathe up to 3 months [old]. And then you add pertussis, and the cough is so intense.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Babies can stop breathing and die, or survive but suffer brain damage, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a third of babies younger than 12 months old who get whooping cough will end up in a hospital, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. One in five babies with whooping cough get pneumonia. About 1 percent, or one in 100, will die.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Early symptoms can mimic a cold. Typically, it takes five to 10 days for symptoms to appear, although it can take as long as three weeks. The cough associated with pertussis can last for weeks or months and can lead to pneumonia in children and even adults. For some patients, the coughing is so severe that &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/w/whooping-cough-pertussis-in-adults.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;they faint, vomit, burst blood vessels in their eyes or even fracture ribs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to recognize early that the cough is more than just a typical cold, as antibiotics can reduce the severity of infection if identified early. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corbin, who is a biomedical scientist, said she was surprised by how severe the symptoms were for an 11-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was really awful on him,” she said. “He hated having these coughing fits because he felt like he was dying. He couldn’t breathe. It was really scary.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Babies may struggle to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-later-symptoms"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Later symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Make high-pitched “whoop” sound when inhaling after coughing&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vomit during or after a fit of coughing&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Feel tired after coughing (but seems well in-between fits)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Have hard time sleeping at night&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Struggle to breathe&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cough hard enough to break a rib&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;em&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cases-still-rising"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cases still rising&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19 had the side benefit of  lowering the number of whooping cough cases. People were isolating, and fewer children were congregating in schools. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Health officials said that fewer people following those protocols recently, and the natural ebb and flow of whooping cough, played a role in the spike in cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state &lt;a href="https://epi.dph.ncdhhs.gov/cd/figures.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;recorded 831 cases last year&lt;/a&gt; and appears on track to meet or exceed that amount this year. Nearly a third of the state’s cases last year were reported from September through December, according to an NC Health News analysis of preliminary state data compiled by the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Carolina had 661 cases as of Sept. 1, NCDHHS told NC Health News in an email. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are likely more cases that haven’t been identified due to misdiagnoses, underdiagnoses and fading immunity, &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/diphtheria-tetanus-and-pertussis-vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;according to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Cases can be misdiagnosed because the bacteria that causes pertussis are only detectable at the beginning of an infection, and many people don’t seek help until later, the hospital said on its &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Vaccine Education Center&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some people don’t ever seek help, leading to underdiagnoses. And fading immunity plays a role, as people can get infected by pertussis more than once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who have been vaccinated should be wary about spreading whooping cough if they get sick, Creede said. Even though the vaccination will protect against severe illness, the person would still be infectious. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You think you’re just coming down with a common cold kind of thing. You’ve got this tickle in your throat that just won’t go away, but it’s not really making you sick,” she said. “It spreads so easily like that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAGygY2lzHc/mnjZl5W0VI9dWkfNHWAogA/view?utm_content=DAGygY2lzHc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;amp;utm_medium=embeds&amp;amp;utm_source=link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Whooping cough cases in NC 2025&lt;/a&gt; by Jennifer Fernandez&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vaccination"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children get a series of vaccinations for whooping cough, with the first doses closely grouped together at 2 months old, 4 months old and 6 months old, with a final infant dose at 15 to 18 months old. Boosters are recommended between ages 4 to 6 and 11 to 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shot young children get is a combination vaccination for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, often shortened to DTaP. Older children and adults get booster shots that include tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis, called Tdap.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Federal data show that DTaP vaccinations in North Carolina ticked up last school year to 94 percent, up from 93.5 percent the previous school year. Current data wasn’t available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, non-medical vaccination exemptions keep climbing nationally and in North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last school year, 3.1 percent of kindergarten students requested an exemption for one or more vaccines for non-medical reasons, data show. A decade ago, 0.9 percent of kindergarten students sought a non-medical exemption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nationally, that’s increased from 2 percent to 3.4 percent in the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping vaccination levels at a certain percentage — at least 92 to 94 percent for whooping cough — is important to help stop illnesses from spreading in a community, Creede said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Letting that level drop for whooping cough could be deadly, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, we’ll lose babies. That’s what will happen,” Creede said. “We’ve got some herd immunity right now, and all of the work that we do is to protect those most vulnerable — those infants, the immunosuppressed and the very elderly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-due-diligence"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Due diligence’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 1,500 people in Buncombe County have been tested for whooping cough this year, Santamaria said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Part of that is because we know it’s in our community,” Creede said. “So the providers are doing due diligence and saying, ‘Well, let’s test this. I don’t hear a whoop or anything, but it just could be, because it’s a sneaky little cheeky monkey, and we’re going to test for you anyway.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cases of school children getting whooping cough, the health department sends letters to every family with a child in that class, Creede said. It notifies families that there has been a case in their child’s class and advises that if anyone gets “so much as a runny nose or a little bit of a cough,” they need to be evaluated, Creede said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Parents also get a letter to give their provider advising them of a case of whooping cough in their patient’s classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Because if you walk in and you’re not barking with the whoop, they may not think about it,” Creede said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corbin said she wouldn’t have known to get her son tested for whooping cough if she hadn’t gotten a letter from the school about him being in close contact with someone with the illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire family took prophylactic antibiotics as a precaution after her oldest son tested positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you do get a close contact notification and your kid has any symptoms at all … it’s worth getting them tested,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

that&lt;span&gt; if you slightly change three areas of your life simultaneously, it can significantly change your life expectancy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His team, who are based at the University of Sydney looked at data from 60,000 people over a period of eight years, noting how long they sleep, the minutes they spend exercising and their diet quality score (DQS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The DQS score, which is marked out of 100, is based on intake of vegetables, fruits, fish, dairy products, whole grains, vegetable oils, refined grains, processed meats, and unprocessed meats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previously a study found one in seven Britons survive on less than five hours of sleep—far below the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-794071d0-9e0f-11f0-8866-455582cbabf2"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; recommended seven to nine hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prof Stamatakis' team found if you sleep five-and-a-half hours, only exercise for 7.3 minutes a day and your DQS score is 36.9, minor tweaks can significantly lower your mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sleeping an extra 15 minutes, exercising for 1.6 minutes more and eating an extra half a serving of vegetables a day—or one less serving of processed meat a week—could lower your risk of death by 10 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-module-version="1.16.0" data-dataset-id="2057" data-mol-fe-xpmodule-newsletter-sign-up data-newsletter="configurable" data-form-action-url="https://link.news.dailymail.co.uk/s/Health" data-environment="production" data-newsletter-id="Health" data-newsletter-channel-colour="health" data-watermark="uk" data-image="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2025/09/25/SignUpModule_Image_Health.png" data-title="Sign up for our free Health newsletter" data-subtitle="Transform your health every Tuesday with expert guides, real-life stories and advice from top doctors"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts have revealed minor tweaks you can make that can slash some people's risk of an early death by 10 per cent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you go further, sleeping for an extra 75 minutes a day, spend 12.5 minutes a day doing moderate-vigorous exercise, and raise your DQS score by 25 points to 61.9, your risk of death is slashed by a half. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Examples of moderate-vigorous exercise include swimming, running, power walking, water aerobics, double tennis, dance, and cycling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Half a portion of vegetables can be a broccoli spear, a tablespoon of cooked spinach, a heaped teaspoon of cooked kale, 2.5cm of cucumber or half a medium tomato.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, processed meats that you can cut out include bacon, sausages ham, hot dogs, salami, corned beef, and spam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other research has linked highly processed food to obesity, heart disease, colorectal and breast cancers, diabetes, and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, studies have shown not getting enough sleep for a long time raises your risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease and a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ideal 'optimal combination', the Australia researchers found was 7.2 to eight hours of sleep, 42 to 103 minutes of moderate-vigorous exercise and a high DQS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the journal, BMC Medicine, the Australian researchers said changes in these three areas—SPAN, which stands for sleep, physical activity and sleep—work best in harmony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Stamatakis said: 'We want to lower the bar of participation and lower the bar of getting movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's about giving options to the 80 or 85 per cent of the population who are not keen on doing regular, structured exercise.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These steps, he explained are 'not an optimal fitness solution' which would require 'structured exercise' and 'major commitments'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But their findings provide practical steps people can take, which is vital, he explained, because inactive people 'are at the highest risk of chronic disease'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These are accessible and manageable changes that can make a difference in people incorporating them, ideally simultaneously into their lives in the long term,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nicholas Koemel, of the same university, added: 'We're talking about a couple of minutes of extra MVPA, combined with 15 extra minutes of sleep and between half and one extra portion of fruits and vegetables, or analogous improvements across other aspects of our diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's the synergistic and combined power of small changes. This is what the SPAN stream of work is looking into: trying to understand the potential of these interventions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expert secrets, anti-ageing tips and more!

However, with antibiotic resistance now a growing problem, phage therapy might be set for a dramatic comeback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that bacteria are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ancient-killer-is-rapidly-becoming-resistant-to-antibiotics-study-warns"&gt;continually evolving&lt;/a&gt; to put up better defenses against the drugs we're throwing at them, so treatments that were once very effective can sometimes end up being useless. It's a major problem &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drug-resistant-bacteria-expected-to-kill-tens-of-millions-by-2050"&gt;for public health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, led by researchers from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel and the University of Melbourne in Australia, phage therapy shows promise in the fight against antibiotic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there are challenges to overcome. Bacteria can also develop tricks to outsmart &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage"&gt;the bacteriophages&lt;/a&gt; behind phage therapy, so understanding how that occurs will be important, moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-own-mouth-bacteria-could-give-you-a-heart-attack-new-study-suggests"&gt;Your Own Mouth Bacteria Could Give You a Heart Attack, New Study Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Understanding the arms race between phages and bacteria not only deepens our knowledge of how bacteria defend themselves but also opens the door to next-generation treatments," &lt;a href="https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/revisiting-a-100-year-old-medical-treatment-to-tackle-the-growing-crisis-of-antibiotic-resistance"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; molecular biologist Debnath Ghosal, from the University of Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers took a close look at the bacterium &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus_subtilis"&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and a variety of phages used to tackle it. Watching &lt;em&gt;B. subtilis&lt;/em&gt; work through its blocking tactics, researchers found the protein YjbH – seen in many bacteria – played a significant role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174584" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174584" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/PhageProtection.jpg" alt="Phage protection" class="wp-image-174584 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/PhageProtection.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/PhageProtection-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/PhageProtection-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174584" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers determined how YjbH protects bacteria cells. (Fiyaksel et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell Rep.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteriophages work by attaching themselves &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus-that-murders-sleeping-bacteria-could-be-used-to-assassinate-superbugs"&gt;to bacteria cells&lt;/a&gt;, essentially hijacking these cells to duplicate and spread. That's done with an injection of bacteriophage DNA, and eventually the bacterial cell bursts, releasing more phages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What YjbH does is sense this invasion and take steps to limit the damage, effectively roping off the spot where the bacteriophage has attached itself. The cell then divides, in an attempt discard the roped off area and hopefully survive &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/case-study-shows-promise-of-specialized-bacteriophage-treatments-for-fight-against-superbugs"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This 'exclude and survive' defense mechanism may represent a prevalent strategy employed by the host to contain viral spread," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2025.115994"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an impressive escape strategy, and it's the first time scientists have seen it used to defend against bacteriophage attack. Before now, it was thought to be something only more complex, multicellular organisms could do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we're aware of it, of course, we might be able to develop phage therapy approaches that get around it too – making phage therapy a more viable alternative or complementary treatment &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mixing-coffee-and-antibiotics-could-be-a-bad-idea-study-shows"&gt;to antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's still a long way off, because bacteria defense mechanisms are just one of several issues with phage therapy. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40560-024-00759-7"&gt;Recent studies&lt;/a&gt; have found this strategy to be limited in its effectiveness, in part because the body's immune system sees the bacteriophages as threats, and works to try to wipe them out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, plenty of groups think there's enough potential here – and enough of a crisis in terms of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/achilles-heel-of-drug-resistant-bacteria-has-been-found-scientists-say"&gt;antibiotic treatments&lt;/a&gt; – for further investigation into phage therapies to be worthwhile, which is the plan for the researchers behind this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hope that by reactivating phage therapy, we can contribute to non-antibiotic treatments for infections," &lt;a href="https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/revisiting-a-100-year-old-medical-treatment-to-tackle-the-growing-crisis-of-antibiotic-resistance"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; Ghosal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With so many antibiotic-resistant infections emerging, after 100 years, it's time to reconsider the benefits of phage therapy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2025.115994"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
