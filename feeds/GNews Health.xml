    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vuxidq001w27qe64iucdk9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles could become endemic in the United States if routine childhood vaccination rates continue to decline, with up to 51 million illnesses over a 25-year period, according to a new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vuyeqd00053b6m82bxpye7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the disease is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-measles-vaccination/data-research/global-measles-outbreaks/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;endemic in some other countries&lt;/a&gt; – meaning it happens regularly within an area or community – it was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" target="_blank"&gt;declared eliminated&lt;/a&gt; in the US in 2000 because of vaccination efforts with the highly effective measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vuyeqd00063b6m29exny5w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nearly 900 measles cases have been recorded in the US this year, with more than half of states reporting at least one case, according to a CNN tally using data from state health departments and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of the cases have been linked with &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/health/measles-cases-us-dg/index.html"&gt;an outbreak&lt;/a&gt; centered on an area of West Texas with a large unvaccinated population.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vuyeqd00073b6mvoyrvp0y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2833361" target="_blank"&gt;new model&lt;/a&gt;, published Thursday in the journal JAMA, looks at the potential spread of the disease in the US over 25 years based on different vaccination levels calculated using data from 2004-23.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vuyeqd00083b6mlu0dxd1e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers – from Stanford, Baylor, Rice and Texas A&amp;amp;M universities – estimate current state-by-state vaccination coverage for measles at 87.7% to 95.6%. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vuyeqd00093b6mk9hms08e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because measles is so contagious, experts say the only way to prevent outbreaks is if at least 95% of a community has received two doses of the MMR vaccine. After this rate was maintained for a decade, though, coverage dipped during the Covid-19 pandemic and has yet to recover. The measles vaccination rate fell to 92.7% for kindergartners in the 2023-24 school year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/02/health/measles-vaccine-coverage-kindergarten-school-requirement/index.html"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vuyeqd000a3b6mlhgbp34x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At current vaccination rates, the model predicts that the disease would become endemic in the US within 25 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vuyeqd000b3b6mhy8wpgg0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If the vaccination rate declines 10%, the US would see 11.1 million cases of measles over this period.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vuyeqd000c3b6mffd0xrw7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If current trends were reversed and there was a 5% increase in the number of people getting the MMR vaccine, however, there would be only 5,800 measles cases over 25 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vuyeqd000d3b6md4n41vv0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The model showed that other vaccine-preventable diseases shouldn’t become endemic in the US at current levels of vaccination. If, however, routine childhood vaccination falls 50%, it predicts 51.2 million measles cases over a 25-year period, 9.9 million cases of rubella, 4.3 million cases of poliomyelitis and 197 cases of diphtheria. With such a steep decline in vaccinations, these diseases would cause 10.3 million hospitalizations and 159,000 deaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vuyeqd000e3b6mmbu6r3ht@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These findings support the need to continue routine childhood vaccination at high coverage to prevent resurgence of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases in the US,” the researchers wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vzpf3x0001336mdb32zqti@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the limitations of the study is that it doesn’t take into account that vaccination rates can fluctuate from community to community. Essentially, each state gets its own bucket, noted Dr. Mujeeb Basit, a modeling expert on disease spread who wasn’t involved with the new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vzhjpw0007336mfqy3pe9r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But the problem with that is, you’re comparing Texas to a smaller state like Rhode Island. So it’s not a homogenous distribution by size, so the accuracy of the numbers will fluctuate,” said Basit, a professor at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vzz2gg00033b6mbwu23tno@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But he said the issue is computationally difficult, and the researchers took a “really nice approach.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vzc3q30005336memsoa2fr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Research like this is important, he said, because it shows clearly that if vaccination trends continue, the US could experience continuous measles outbreaks that would have a cascading effect on the health system.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9w003yb00093b6md9486cdt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Hopefully, it will get people to think,” he said – and to act, getting protection through vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

Figures such as Prince Harry, Sir Elton John and Gwyneth Paltrow were all known for partying hard in their twenties but have since cut down or given up on booze. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/stig-abell-midlife-turning-40-obsessive-37pks2rtd" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I’m an obsessive midlife man. Am I having a crisis?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Dr Tiia Kekalainen, a health scientist who worked on the study, said: “Our findings highlight the importance of tackling risky health behaviours, such as smoking, &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/alcohol-breast-cancer-risk-women-bowel-7nqsgg9xd" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;heavy drinking&lt;/a&gt; and physical inactivity, as early as possible to prevent the damage they do from building up over the years, culminating in poor mental and physical health later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“However, it is never too late to change to healthier habits. Adopting healthier habits in midlife also has benefits for older age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The study involved data from hundreds of children who were born in the Finnish city of Jyvaskyla in 1959. They completed health checks when they were 27 years old and again when they were aged 36, 42, 50 and 61. This involved assessing three risky behaviours — if they &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/french-paradox-heart-health-britain-xgjg9wksx" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;smoked, drank heavily and were inactive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;All three habits were associated with declines in both mental and physical health, with the effects apparent by the time participants were in their mid-thirties. Indulging in all three habits was particularly bad for health in the long term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The habits were linked to an array of non-infectious diseases such as heart disease and cancer, which cause almost three quarters of deaths worldwide. “By following a healthy lifestyle, an individual can cut their risk of developing these illnesses and reduce their odds of an early death,” said Kekalainen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="paywall-portal-article-footer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 23:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxQeVplRXp6RlhZMWhlajlva0l0UXpQemx6S3pqblRIb1BJc3p1Y0xYVDFpRXhDT3U2LUo0ZlphRnZLOFlCUmVMOUFfbG81bndhRVJ3ZTlfMjJfSmN6VVg3MTJqZ0FoLUROQ1ZMUS1pNldWUXM4elk1dnBPck9MVWh1TE91cElxTGdWWFQ2UE1uMFQ5eXNCOEE</guid></item><item><title>犹他州情侣分享终末期痴呆症诊断之旅- KSL TV 5 | Utah couple shares journey navigating a terminal dementia diagnosis - KSL TV 5</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxQckZfTDdJTFh4QmVvMTVwTmViOW01REFkenQ1bGg3RmVEc0FIYlVNMGF2cjFwZUpkVUZJTU5DeHBiZlF0eTR2YXQyX3lBdVNjcXByZW94MzA1U3pBWHFzM2Y1dlhGa3Z1bDIwaTJ5MnR0Y1BreU1TeGlaNWpmMzFROE9xRG9GSlc4RTB6Q0VCMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story_body"&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;TAYLORSVILLE — Misplacing car keys or having trouble remembering a specific date are normal signs of aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when is it “just getting older” and when could it be a more serious problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A dementia diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack and Debbie Lucas know firsthand how conditions like dementia can take a toll on an entire family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s really hard for me when I can’t remember something,” 69-year-old Debbie said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_767249" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-767249" class="wp-image-767249 size-full" src="https://ksltv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/brain_health_2_042425-e1745535279315.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-767249" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jack and Debbie Lucas know firsthand how conditions like dementia can take a toll on an entire family. (KSL TV)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debbie, whose mother had Alzheimer’s, went in for a cognitive test seven years ago and was told she had Alzheimer’s. But through additional genetic testing, she was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which affects less than one in 30 people with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To have that ultimate diagnosis of ‘it’s terminal’ was pretty significant,” Jack said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Frontotemporal dementia affects patients when certain areas of their brain start decreasing,” said Dr. Angel Lybbert, a geriatrician at Intermountain Health. “There’s different variants. You can have a language variant where it affects your ability to find words more prominently, and you can have a behavioral variant where your personality might change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four main types of dementia are Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and FTD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack said they are hoping for more research to be done on frontotemporal dementia, as Debbie’s genetic variant is extremely rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s just recently that we’re even delving into diagnosing people on that level and having the ability to do that with genetic testing,” Lybbert said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Signs of normal aging vs. dementia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While occasional confusion or forgetfulness can be normal with aging, Lybbert said signs of dementia include significant memory lapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You might see it in someone who is asking questions repetitively or having to be told about appointment times and things that you had just reviewed with them, forgetting important events, forgetting how to do things that were second nature; for example, navigating somewhere in the car to a familiar place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_767253" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-767253" class="wp-image-767253 size-full" src="https://ksltv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Debbie-Jack-Lucas-family-Apr-2025-e1745535423688.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-767253" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lucas family is celebrating Debbie’s birthday with roller skating. (Photo courtesy: Jack and Debbie Lucas)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lybbert said you can keep your brain sharp by getting regular exercise, eating pa healthy diet that includes plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, getting adequate sleep, managing medical conditions like high blood pressure, and staying mentally and socially engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Being isolated is a risk factor for dementia, so it’s important to keep those conversations going,” Lybbert said. “If it’s not in your personality to be super outgoing, have tons of friends, you don’t need to change who you are, but you have to talk to someone at least once a day. Just make sure you’re not spending days at a time alone in your home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack and Debbie take walks every day and continue to participate in other activities they enjoy, like roller skating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It helps me a lot to go visit the grandkids, to take them for an ice cream,” Debbie said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your quality of life is enhanced when you’re staying active, you’re eating right, and being involved socially, those typical things that you would do in any cognitive or dementia situation,” Jack said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;One day at a time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some days are better than others, and Jack added that being a caregiver can be challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When your spouse starts not remembering your past…life is kind of made up of memories, and when you don’t have that, it’s an interesting aspect going forward,” Jack said. “It’s been more of an emotional rollercoaster for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But through it all — they’re still able to laugh and live life in the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s, you know, something that we can enjoy together for the moment,” Jack said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any memory-related concerns, talk to your primary care doctor. For people ages 65 and older, a mini cognitive screening is part of the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr., a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/28/rfk-jr-vaccines-kennedy-confirmation-hearing-vaccination-policy-hhs-secretary/"&gt;longtime vaccine critic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The “Vaccine Integrity Project,” which was publicly launched Thursday by the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, will be aimed at assessing the best ways for vaccine proponents to safeguard vaccination policy and information, should government recommendations and information sources become “corrupted,” Michael Osterholm, director of the center, said during a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though plans for the project are still taking shape, Osterholm said it might go so far as to create a new independent body to evaluate the science supporting individual vaccines — a task that at this point falls squarely in the domain of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Osterholm stressed, though, that the body, if formed, could not serve as a shadow version of the ACIP. That’s because it would not have the same legal authorities as the ACIP, such as deciding which vaccines must be provided through the Vaccines for Children Program. The program provides vaccinations for free to children who qualify; &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7333e1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;just over half&lt;/a&gt; of U.S. children are eligible for vaccines through VFC. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Margaret Hamburg, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, and Harvey Fineberg, a former president of the Institute of Medicine — now known as the National Academy of Medicine — will chair a steering committee that will spend the summer meeting with key stakeholders to decide how the project should proceed. They suggested some of the actions the group may explore include developing clinical guidelines and identifying areas where further research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“We take up the Vaccine Integrity Project as a precautionary step,” the two wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/24/vaccine-integrity-project-acip-cdc-fda-rfk-jr-trump-political-interference"&gt;an opinion piece&lt;/a&gt; published Thursday in STAT. “Should ACIP or FDA processes or scientific evaluation become compromised, America cannot afford to be left without any organized systems to ensure that evidence grounded in science continues to guide decisions about the use of vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Andrew Nixon, HHS communications director, dismissed the project as an “unaccountable group of former officials circling the wagons to protect outdated narratives.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Secretary Kennedy and Director Bhattacharya will continue to prioritize open scientific debate and [the] Gold Standard of Science to inform decision making,” Nixon wrote in an email. Jay Bhattacharya is the director of the National Institutes of Health, an agency that neither approves vaccines nor makes recommendations on how they should be used.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy for years led Children’s Health Defense, an organization that opposes vaccine mandates and argues that vaccines themselves are dangerous despite health officials’ and experts’ statements to the contrary. He also has been involved in a number of personal injury lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since being confirmed as HHS secretary, Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/03/rfk-jr-vaccine-skepticism-on-view-in-texas-measles-outbreak-response/"&gt;stressed that getting vaccinated is a personal choice&lt;/a&gt; and has demanded that agency websites under his control highlight that view.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even though the country is in the grips of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/18/measles-outbreak-could-last-a-year-texas-public-health-official-predicts/"&gt;one of the largest measles outbreaks in decades&lt;/a&gt; — an outbreak that has already claimed three lives — he has refrained from publicly urging parents to get their children vaccinated. Though it is common for public health leaders to strongly advocate for vaccination in such situations, the furthest Kennedy has gone is to say that vaccination is the best way to contain measles. He has also &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/10/rfk-jr-measles-vaccines-outbreak-comments/"&gt;raised safety concerns about the vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, and suggested two children who died from measles in West Texas actually succumbed to other illnesses. (In addition to the Texas children, an unvaccinated adult in New Mexico died.)&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;He has been a vocal critic of the ACIP, alleging that the vast majority of its members have conflicts of interests. There have been fears that he might try to replace members of the committee with people whose views on vaccines are more aligned with his own, or undermine its work in other ways. Earlier this week &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/22/trump-pull-covid-vaccine-recommendation-children-00304091" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Politico reported&lt;/a&gt; that he is considering unilaterally striking Covid vaccines from the childhood vaccination schedule, a guide devised by the ACIP and the CDC and used by medical professionals to determine which vaccines children should receive, and at what age. If Covid vaccines were no longer listed on the childhood immunization schedule, insurance companies would not have to pay for the vaccines and they would not be eligible for provision through the Vaccines for Children Program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Osterholm said that the aim of the Vaccine Integrity Project is to try to establish a roadmap for what could be done if government sources of information on vaccines can no longer be trusted. “We all recognize that the vaccine enterprise is at some risk right now,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The effort is being funded through an unrestricted grant from Alumbra, a foundation established by philanthropist Christy Walton.&lt;/p&gt;

By identifying unique DNA junctions from each patient’s tumor, the test can detect tumor DNA in the bloodstream, even before changes appear on MRI scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These DNA fragments bypass some limitations of the blood-brain barrier, offering a sensitive early warning for disease advancement. The test detected tumor activity in 93% of cases, showing promise as a clinical tool for tailoring treatments and monitoring outcomes in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DNA Junction Focus:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers targeted tumor-specific DNA junctions, which are more abundant and easier to detect than other fragments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Detection:&lt;/strong&gt; Tumor DNA levels in blood sometimes rose before any visible MRI changes, offering earlier insights.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Accuracy:&lt;/strong&gt; The personalized test detected tumor DNA in 93% of patients with known DNA junctions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mayo Clinic researchers have identified a potential new way to monitor the progression of high-grade gliomas, one of the most aggressive types of brain cancer. Their feasibility study suggests that a personalized blood test tailored to each patient’s tumor DNA could provide a faster and less invasive way to determine if the cancer is advancing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, clinicians rely on scans and surgical biopsies to monitor gliomas, but both methods have limitations. For example, scans often cannot distinguish tumor growth from treatment effects such as inflammation. Biopsies require invasive procedures, making them impractical for routine monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109109"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and a test tube." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The test detected tumor DNA in approximately 93% of the cases where these DNA junctions were present. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new approach, published in &lt;em&gt;Clinical Cancer Research&lt;/em&gt;, may provide clinicians with another tool to monitor tumor changes over time and adjust treatment as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings focus on tumor DNA fragments circulating in the blood. As gliomas grow, some glioma cells die, shedding pieces of their DNA into the bloodstream and leaving behind genetic markers that are unique to the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, gliomas release fewer DNA fragments into the blood compared to many other cancers. This is because of the blood-brain barrier, a natural brain defense that prevents many substances from leaving the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome this limitation, researchers focused on DNA junctions, a type of tumor-specific DNA fragment that is present in higher quantities. By targeting these markers, researchers achieved greater sensitivity, enabling them to detect even the smallest signs of tumor progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike normal DNA, which follows a structured sequence, these DNA junctions form when the tumor’s genetic material breaks and rearranges. The study found that these amplified DNA junctions, due to their higher numbers, may provide a clearer picture of disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research builds on years of studying genetic rearrangements and gives us a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving gliomas,” says lead author George Vasmatzis, Ph.D., co-director of the Biomarker Discovery Program at Mayo Clinic’s Center for Individualized Medicine and Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It offers new possibilities for patient-specific monitoring and targeted interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, researchers analyzed samples from patients with high-grade gliomas. They used whole genome sequencing to map each tumor’s unique genetic blueprint and pinpointed patient-specific DNA junctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers then developed personalized blood tests to search for these genetic markers in plasma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test detected tumor DNA in approximately 93% of the cases where these DNA junctions were present. In some patients, tumor DNA levels in the blood rose before MRI scans showed any changes — offering a potential early signal for disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connecting cutting-edge research and clinical practice, Dr. Vasmatzis and Terry Burns, M.D., Ph.D., a neurosurgeon at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, collaborated on the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By tracking each tumor’s distinct molecular signature, we’re aiming to shift from a reactive approach to one that’s far more proactive,” says Dr. Burns, a study co-author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research could lay the groundwork for tools that help clinicians make the most informed treatment decisions as early as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies will evaluate how well blood-based tumor tracking correlates with glioma progression across a larger group of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this brain cancer and genetics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#89e7ecfefaebfcfbece8fcc9e4e8f0e6a7ecedfc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sharon Theimer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mayo.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Sharon Theimer – Mayo Clinic&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article/doi/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-24-3233/754481/Personalized-Tumor-Specific-Amplified-DNA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Personalized Tumor-Specific Amplified DNA Junctions in Peripheral Blood of Patients with High-Grade Gliomas&lt;/a&gt;” by George Vasmatzis et al. &lt;em&gt;Clinical Cancer Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalized Tumor-Specific Amplified DNA Junctions in Peripheral Blood of Patients with High-Grade Gliomas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitoring disease progression in patients with high-grade gliomas (HGG) is challenging due to treatment-related changes in imaging and the requirement for neurosurgical intervention to obtain diagnostic tissue. DNA junctions in HGG often amplify oncogenes, making these DNA fragments potentially more abundant in blood than monoallelic mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we piloted a cell-free DNA approach for disease detection in the plasma of patients with HGG by leveraging patient-specific DNA junctions associated with oncogene amplifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experimental Design:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole-genome sequencing of grade 3 or 4 isocitrate dehydrogenase–mutant or wild-type astrocytomas was utilized to identify amplified junctions. Individualized qPCR assays were developed using patient-specific primers designed for the amplified junction. ctDNA levels containing these junctions were measured in patient plasma samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unique amplified junctions were evaluated by individualized semi-qPCR assays in presurgical plasma of 18 patients, 15 with tumor-associated focal amplifications and three without tumor-associated focal amplifications. high copy-number junctions were robustly detected in the plasma of 14 of 15 (93.3%) patients with amplified junctions and none of the controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in junction abundance correlated with disease trajectory in serial plasma samples from five patients, including increased abundance of amplified junctions preceding radiographic disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In patients with grade 3 or 4 astrocytomas who had tumor-associated amplifications, patient-specific amplified junctions were successfully detected in assayed plasma from most patients.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Over the last few years, there has been mounting evidence that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7775696/plant-based-diet-for-beginners-your-guide-to-getting-started/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating more plants&lt;/a&gt;—including whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds—benefits health in many ways, primarily in reducing disease risk. This is partly due to plants’ effects on our microbiomes, as they provide plenty of fiber that acts as food for beneficial bacteria to thrive and multiply. A healthy microbiome has been linked with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lower chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/fiber-intake-metabolic-disease-risk-research-8729291" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;disease risk&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study aimed to assess how the nutritional environment is associated with age-specific mortality (death) in 101 countries. Specifically, it considered animal-based protein (ABP; meat, poultry, seafood dairy and eggs) and plant-based protein (PBP) availability in these countries to see how they were associated with longevity. To do so, researchers used the geometric framework for nutrition (GFN). This framework examines undernutrition, overnutrition and nutrient amounts and compositions—that includes which macro- and micronutrients foods are made up of).

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Using these parameters, researchers could predict the effects of ABP, PBP, fat and carbohydrate availability on a country and assess their influence on longevity at different age points, specifically children who live to age 5 and adults who live to age 60.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-show"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Show? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After running statistical analyses, including adjusting for confounders, researchers found that higher animal-based protein supplies were associated with enhanced survival during infancy and early childhood, independent of total calorie supplies. In other words, regardless of how much total food is available in a country, higher availability of animal protein is linked with infants and children surviving to at least 5 years old. Researchers also found that when overall protein availability was low—regardless of the type of protein—survival rates were also low in infants and children under 5.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even so, plant-based protein was associated with better longevity in adults.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers explain that animal-based protein early in life provides complete proteins that are more easily digestible and absorbable compared to many plant-based protein sources.  In addition, compared to plants, animal-based protein also provides more fat and nutrients essential for proper growth and development in infancy and childhood. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to these researchers, nutrients like iron, zinc and vitamin A are often lacking in developing countries where under-5 mortality is high, and animal-based protein may be an easier provider of these nutrients. Study authors note that some infant and childhood deaths can also be attributed to maternal undernutrition and deficiencies during pregnancy, and that providing animal-based protein may more easily help fill this gap. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is not to say that plant protein should be neglected in infancy and childhood, since researchers note that adding energy from any protein source—animal or plant—is better than not getting enough protein overall, especially in countries where food may be more scarce. They add that plant-based diets show promise for children, as long as they are balanced and varied to provide complete amino acids and enough fat for proper development.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Interestingly, the association between animal proteins and longevity weakens as we age, with plant-based proteins becoming more positively influential, since another major finding of this study was that plant-based-rich environments were associated with improved survival later in life. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers note that the data used for this study cannot differentiate between ultra-processed foods and meats and other sources of animal protein, so they cannot state with certainty based on their study which types of animal proteins are linked to early death. With that said, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ultra-processed-foods-cardiovascular-disease-risk-8708994" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt; link regular consumption of ultra-processed foods, processed meats and foods high in added sugar with chronic disease—including heart disease, stroke and diabetes—and dying younger. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study also linked higher fat availability, especially in countries where animal-based proteins were more plentiful, to dying younger. Though the researchers weren’t able to differentiate between processed meat and meat in general, one could hypothesize that some of the excessive fat consumption likely comes from ultra-processed foods and meats.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study authors name several limitations of this study. For example, their findings are limited because they are based on national food supply data, not individual dietary intake. Because of this, they could not account for the many variables that can influence longevity. This analysis also doesn’t account for the differences between types of carbohydrates and fats, including the different types of carbs, like refined carbs, complex carbs with fiber and sugar, nor between saturated fats, polyunsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While it can mean different things to different people, eating plant-based doesn’t necessarily mean completely going vegan, or even vegetarian (which includes some animal products, like eggs and dairy). If you’re not ready to completely give up meat, consider increasing your intake of plants by swapping your typical meat-based recipes for more plant-forward ones. Some good sources of plant protein that are easy to start with include legumes, soy, tofu, nuts, seeds and whole grains, like quinoa and amaranth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re a big fan of meat at dinner, you could also try some recipes that stretch animal-based protein with some tasty plant protein. That’s especially easy to do when you use ground meat, like we do in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269787/beef-bean-sloppy-joes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Beef &amp;amp; Bean Sloppy Joes&lt;/a&gt;, or when you make a fun grain bowl, like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7870644/pesto-chicken-quinoa-bowls/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Pesto Chicken Quinoa Bowls&lt;/a&gt;. Combining plant- and animal-based proteins is also the point of eating plans like the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/flexitarian-diet-dinner-recipes-for-beginners-7160257" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;flexitarian diet&lt;/a&gt;, which balances both for filling, tasty meals that can help you ease into trying out vegan protein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can also make some easy swaps to add more plants to your diet. For example, instead of pizza with pepperoni, sausage, ham or beef, make it a veggie pizza. Rather than having bacon and sausage with your eggs, consider making a veggie hash—like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7950433/sweet-potato-broccoli-wild-rice-hash/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Sweet Potato, Broccoli &amp;amp; Wild Rice Hash&lt;/a&gt;—or something saucy like these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/264141/baked-eggs-in-tomato-sauce-with-kale/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Baked Eggs in Tomato Sauce with Kale&lt;/a&gt;. Now and then, swap your burger or taco with a vegetarian version, like we do in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250670/quinoa-veggie-burger/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Quinoa Veggie Burger&lt;/a&gt; and our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8043180/vegetarian-tacos/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Best Vegetarian Tacos&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re ready to jump in for more of a full-immersion experience and want to be sure you’re getting plenty of plant-based protein, try any of our high-protein plant-based meal plans, including this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7826129/plant-based-meal-plan-for-beginners/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;weeklong plan for beginners&lt;/a&gt; or our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-high-protein-meal-plan-for-healthy-aging-8777942" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;30-day plan for healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;. All of our meal plans are created by registered dietitians, so you know they’re balanced, nutritious and delicious. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most of our recipes and meal plans stay away from ultra-processed plant-based “meats,” like those that mimic the taste and texture of animal proteins like burgers, bacon and hot dogs. Ultra-processed meat, whether from animal or plant sources, usually isn’t the best choice for your health. For example, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7993257/is-plant-based-meat-healthy-heres-what-a-dietitian-has-to-say/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;evidence that eating plant-based meat products&lt;/a&gt; can increase your intake of calories, fat, sugar and salt, and that those who regularly rely on these products may end up with deficiencies in key nutrients, including calcium, potassium, magnesium, zinc and vitamin B12. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What you eat is just one piece of the longevity puzzle. Plenty of habits contribute to better health, including &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/i-tried-eating-the-doctor-recommended-30-plant-based-foods-a-week-8763777" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating a diverse diet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-no-added-sugar-snacks-for-blood-sugar-8710202" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;limiting added sugars&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/exercise-every-day-study-11707905" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;exercising regularly&lt;/a&gt;, prioritizing sleep and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/loneliness-immune-system-study-8772697" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;spending time with loved ones&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that while animal-based protein may have advantages during infancy and childhood, plant-based protein has a more positive influence later in life and may help you live longer. Eating more plant-based foods has many health advantages, including a reduced risk of cancer, heart disease and diabetes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You don’t have to become vegan or vegetarian to enjoy the benefits that eating more plants has to offer. Start with just one snack a day or one meal a week, and gradually go up from there. Look for easy, creative ways to add plant proteins to foods you already eat—add a handful of walnuts and chia seeds to your oatmeal, make a veggie sandwich with cheese and hummus spread on whole-grain bread or swap out the meat in your soup for protein-rich beans. Before long, you’ll realize that plants have become a regular part of your meal pattern.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Those cleanings have either already taken place or will shortly and will continue to take place as needed, more out of an abundance of caution than in response to evidence of activity.” He did not share the name of the contractor in charge of this cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mammoth Inn was built in 1958 near the Mammoth Ski Area’s main base area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lester Black/SFGATE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hantavirus outbreaks can sometimes lead to drastic action.

Because of its rarity, doctors &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/blog/hantavirus-questions-answered" data-link="native" class=""&gt;do not fully understand&lt;/a&gt; how the syndrome progresses, but the syndrome starts with flu-like symptoms such as fever, body aches and dry cough, and then can rapidly progress to lung tissue damage, lung fluid buildup and even heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mammoth Mountain Ski Resort, pictured here in 2024, is in the rugged Eastern Sierra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lester Black/SFGATE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coroner’s report does not specifically say Rodrigo Becerra had hantavirus pulmonary syndrome; it notes the cause of death is “pending pathology and toxicology.” The news release from Mono County about the three hantavirus-related deaths says the county public health department confirmed “a third death due to Hantavirus ... a serious and often fatal illness.” Hantavirus is a group of viruses that can cause two illnesses: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. The pulmonary syndrome is the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/about/index.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;primary disease&lt;/a&gt; caused by the virus in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mariela Becerra said her family is upset that doctors at the local hospital discharged her brother so quickly without any further care, given his severe symptoms. She shared an emergency department provider note produced by the hospital that described him as having “no hanta virus exposure.” It does note that Rodrigo Becerra presented with “fever and flulike symptoms” including gastrointestinal distress; &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/hcp/clinical-overview/hps.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;the CDC notes&lt;/a&gt; hantavirus pulmonary syndrome “initially causes flu-like symptoms that can progress to more severe illness” and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/about/index.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; about half of patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-5" data-large-id="Inline-7" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coroner’s report said a chest X-ray “showed a little abnormality in the left lung, but the heart appeared normal.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They didn’t think that anything was bad enough to admit him or keep him overnight, but for him to pass away the very next morning is frustrating,” Mariela Becerra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mammoth Hospital is located in the small town of Mammoth Lakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lester Black/SFGATE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second individual who died from hantavirus this winter had also visited Mammoth Lakes Hospital prior to his death, according to a second coroner’s report obtained by SFGATE via records request. That individual, a 60-year-old man whom SFGATE has not been able to identify, went to the local hospital on Feb. 16 and was discharged the following day with an antibiotic, according to the coroner’s report.

They should be immediately admitted to an intensive care unit for breathing support and close monitoring of heart function, according to the CDC. “Early intensive medical care is critical because patients who have sudden acute disease can rapidly become severely sick and die,” the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/hcp/clinical-overview/hps.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two people who died from hantavirus this year visited Mammoth Hospital, pictured here in April, and were discharged before their deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lester Black/SFGATE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caporusso, the county spokesperson, said he is unaware of any hospitals anywhere in the country that have in-house hantavirus testing.

You remove the fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A lot of people don't know this because what happens when you remove the fat from yogurt, the whole thing collapses... it doesn't have a mouth feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So you know what the manufacturers do? They put additives [and] emulsifiers [in the yogurt] to build back that thick mouth feel of rich yogurt.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Li's concerns are mostly theoretical - there is little direct evidence showing yoghurt causes cancer and some actually show it may reduce the risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet the health expert points to the use of thickening agents such as carrageenan as concerning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr William Li, whose book Eat to Beat Your Diet is a New York Times bestseller, says that the worst offending yogurts are actually the low-fat varieties&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ingreident also used in other processed dairy products including creamers, chocolate milk, ice cream, cottage cheese, and sour cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it originates naturally from seaweed, the version used in food manufacturing is heavily processed, making it essentially a synthetic ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Li reveals that it has recently come to light that manmade carrageenan can cause gut inflammation, which is a significant risk factor for developing colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another thickening agent that the dietician warns about is polysorbate 80. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2021 study from researchers at the University of Paris that fed mice emulsifiers like polysorbate 80 found consuming the products regularly led to increased gut inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chronic inflammation can increase the risk for cancer by damaging DNA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, they suggested, could put the body at greater risk for developing colorectal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A different study in 2021 found introducing emulsifiers to a colony of bacteria that mimicked the kind found in the human gut caused some of the bacteria to die off or become unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has suggested the bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract play an important role in fighting back against cancer - and that disrupting it could make colorectal cancers more likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2024 University of Miami Gastroenterologist Dr Maria Abreu, who studies the affect of food additives and their link to colon cancer, likewise said that the affect of emulsifiers on the microbiome could be contributing to the number of young people getting cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Separate 2022 research from the French Nutrition and Cancer Research Network studied more than 102,000 adults and estimated their exposure to different food additives over a day by asking them about their diet habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They then tracked them over ten years, and found that those who were estimated to consume higher amounts of certain emulsifiers were more likely to develop breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In light of these findings, Dr Li highlights the importance of checking the ingredients before purchasing a product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He highlights that full-fat dairy goods are usually free of thickening agents and better for your health that low-fat alternatives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also says plain dairy goods are traditionally better than flavored products, as they tend to contain chemicals and more sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Whole Greek yogurt is processed [but] the moment you add that layer of blueberry jam or whatever... ultra-sweetened stuff, added sugar stuff, now it's ultra-processed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Dr Li warns of yogurt's hidden dangers, other experts praise it as a superfood and say that it can actually safeguard against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, doctors from Harvard University found that people who eat at least two servings of yogurt a week could lower their risk of colon cancers caused by bacteria by 20 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers looked at colon cancer tumors caused by Bifidobacterium, a type of bacteria that normally helps digest fiber and ward off infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, excess levels can lead to inflammation in the colon, which damages cells and causes them to grow out of control, resulting in cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers believe healthy bacteria, including Bifidobacterium, found in fermented foods like yogurt can reduce the amount of harmful bacteria living in the gut, reducing the risk of bacteria-fueled colon cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Li says one of the worst offending thickening agents is carrageenan, which is also used in other processed dairy products including creamers, chocolate milk, ice cream, cottage cheese, and sour cream&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they found no link between yogurt and reduced risk of colon cancers caused by other factors such as genes, obesity and chemical exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Li's focus it more on yogurts that have been ultra-processed as opposed to chemical-free yogurts.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is estimated that more than 70 percent of calories consumed by children and adolescents in the US come from ultra-processed foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This compares to around 30 percent three decades ago.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A CDC study states that ultra-processed foods are 'formulations of macronutrients (starches, sugars, fats, and protein isolates) with little, if any, whole food and often with added flavors, colors, emulsifiers, and other cosmetic additives'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Examples of ultra-processed foods given include soft drinks, packaged salty snacks, cookies and cakes, processed meats, chicken nuggets, and powdered and packaged instant soups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But they can also include some healthier options such as wholegrain breakfast cereals, wholemeal bread, canned beans and tofu, which are softer and more palatable compared to pure ingredients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ultra-processed foods are typically energy-dense products, high in calories, added sugar, unhealthy fats, and salt, and low in dietary fiber, protein, vitamins, and minerals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The level of consumption is generally high in high-income countries where the products are more accessible but it is increasing in low-and middle-income countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has shown that high intake of ultra-processed foods is associated with a range of health problems including obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 20:27:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPTkJfX2FVV1BGM1pjbnRKZ1RDRjBFMmVjMXNMSTRlYmtJZl9zZEd0RHplWW1IeWtxN3lTRlRQU2hpMjlwTWFXQjNNRThwdDJMckltMDFYTk00Z2dPMEUwbi1zYVQ0ejA1MGJEODcwRExLQ3Y1XzdDUS1YMXFWX1pKMzh3QnNoRms1RFJOVVliaXhJVFc1TldUeGdKNV9XRmlkaVJIUW5ZWQ</guid></item><item><title>催产素通过平行脑回路激发利他反应-神经科学新闻 | Oxytocin Powers Altruistic Responses via Parallel Brain Circuits - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE9talg4Z2ZibHdiSVQ4VWFvcTRHVlgtMnhTSi0taDVZWWZBSE5Td0d4SEM2dnFkbVFoUFV4bkxRczZBSDk1d2tlQklIT0czbTJZQVQxR3N1RlZpMFpGdF9MbENOT25oUDRFNGhnY1lR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study reveals that mice instinctively display rescue-like behaviors toward anesthetized peers, offering powerful evidence that prosociality may be hardwired in mammals. Researchers identified oxytocin as a key driver, activating two brain pathways to coordinate emotional and motor responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One path processes emotional distress, while the other initiates helping behaviors like licking and grooming. These findings challenge the belief that altruism is limited to more cognitively advanced species and open new doors to studying the neurobiology of empathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instinctive Help:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice licked and groomed anesthetized peers without prior training or rewards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Brain Pathways:&lt;/strong&gt; Oxytocin activated circuits in the amygdala and stria terminalis to drive emotional and motor components of helping behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mutual Benefit:&lt;/strong&gt; Helping behaviors reduced both the observer’s stress and accelerated the peer’s recovery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Chinese Academy of Sciences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a new study, researchers have found that mice can instinctively exhibit rescue-like behavior toward anesthetized conspecifics, without any prior training or external rewards. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, offers compelling evidence that prosocial behavior may be deeply rooted in biology, extending even to small mammals like mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Dr. HU Li from the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Dr. CHEN Zhoufeng from Washington University School of Medicine and the Shenzhen Medical Academy of Research and Translation, the study uncovers the molecular and neural mechanisms that drive this behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings suggest a conserved evolutionary basis for prosociality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although altruistic behaviors—such as helping distressed peers—have been well documented in animals like elephants, dogs, and even ants, the presence of such tendencies in rodents has remained controversial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new study provides robust evidence of such behaviors in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the experiments, an “observer” mouse placed with an anesthetized peer showed clear signs of stress, indicated by elevated blood corticosterone levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, the observer mouse engaged in allogrooming and allolicking—behaviors that not only accelerated the recovery of the anesthetized mouse but also alleviated the observer’s own stress, suggesting a mutually beneficial dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore the underlying mechanisms, the researchers used a combination of advanced tools, including transgenic mice, chemogenetics, optogenetics, and fiber photometry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They discovered that oxytocin (OXT) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus are activated when the observer mouse detects distress signals from a peer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These neurons release OXT, which then acts on two parallel pathways via the oxytocin receptor to coordinate emotional and motor components of the rescue-like behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the pathway through the central amygdala is responsible for decoding the negative emotional valence of the distress signal, while the pathway through the dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis enables the execution of rescue-like behaviors such as licking and grooming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin, often referred to as the “prosocial hormone,” is known to promote empathy, trust, and cooperative behaviors in both animals and humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first study to demonstrate that oxytocin can coordinate both emotional responses and motor actions through a dual-pathway mechanism to facilitate efficient and timely rescue-like behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more than a century, the origins and evolutionary significance of altruism have intrigued philosophers, psychologists, and evolutionary biologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By revealing the neural circuits and molecular players involved in instinctive helping behavior in mice, this study not only challenges previous assumptions but also introduces a novel paradigm for exploring the biological foundations of empathy and social connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In doing so, it lays a foundation for future research into the neurobiology of complex social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About this oxytocin and altruism research news&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:

rescue-like behavior in mice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous rescue behavior enhances the well-being and survival of social animals, yet the neural mechanisms underlying the recognition and response to conspecifics in need remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we report that observer mice experience distress when encountering anesthetized conspecifics, prompting spontaneous rescue-like behavior toward the unconscious mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This behavior facilitates the earlier awakening of anesthetized mice while simultaneously alleviating stress in the helper mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings reveal that endogenous oxytocin (OXT) release from the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) to the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) regulates the emotional component of rescue-like behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, OXT release from the PVN to OXTR in the dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (dBNST) mediates the motor component of the behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we demonstrate that these two pathways exhibited distinct temporal dynamics and functional roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OXT&lt;sup&gt;PVN&lt;/sup&gt;-OXTR&lt;sup&gt;CeA&lt;/sup&gt; pathway is activated in a transient and intense manner, acting as a trigger for rescue-like behavior, whereas the OXT&lt;sup&gt;PVN&lt;/sup&gt;-OXTR&lt;sup&gt;dBNST&lt;/sup&gt; pathway responds in a sustained manner, ensuring the continuation of the behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight the remarkable ability of rodents to engage in targeted helping behavior and suggest that distinct subcortical oxytocinergic pathways selectively and synergistically regulate the motor and emotional aspects of rescue-like behavior.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr

data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For years, the conventional wisdom has been to swap out red meat for white meats like chicken and poultry to help reduce health risks like increased cholesterol, cancer, and &lt;a

But a new study links eating chicken and other poultry with a significantly increased risk of dying from gastrointestinal cancer and all other causes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But before you put down the chicken—or roll your eyes and get back to your chicken Caesar—check out the details of the study, and what a dietitian says you should do if you're concerned.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-about-the-dietary-studyand-its-findings"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; About the Dietary Study—and Its Findings &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study, published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;, followed 4,869 people based in southern Italy who are part of large long-term cohort studies and agreed to fill out dietary and lifestyle surveys. During the study period, which ran from 2006 until 2024, they shared information about their meat consumption, divided into red and white meats, and researchers tracked the cause of death of participants who passed away.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study found that those who ate more than 300 grams (a little more than 10 ounces) of poultry per week had a 27% higher risk of dying than those who ate less than 100 grams (about 3.5 ounces) of chicken or poultry per week. The risk increased even more for those who ate well above that 300 gram range, and was for all causes of death, including cancers and cardiovascular disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The people who ate more than 300 grams of white meat per week also more than doubled their risk of dying from gastrointestinal cancers, compared to those who ate less than 100 grams.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study does seem to conflict with previous studies, which found that eating white meat instead of red meat was more protective against gastrointestinal cancers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And there are limitations to this kind of study, says Theresa Gentile, MS, RD, CDN, spokesperson for the &lt;a href="https://www.eatright.org/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics&lt;/a&gt;. "This study found an association, not a direct cause, between higher poultry intake and increased mortality, especially from gastrointestinal cancers. It doesn't mean poultry causes cancer."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And lifestyle-based studies like this can have a lot of potentially confounding factors that could account for some of this discrepancy, including:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; The cooking method and processing of the chicken could have an impact on how healthy it is &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "There is lack of data on the cooking method of the chicken," Gentile says. "Chicken cooked at high temperatures, like grilling, barbecuing, or frying, can create heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are compounds known to increase cancer risk."&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If the chicken was highly processed, that could have an impact as well. "Even though the study participants were following a Mediterranean diet, it's very possible some of the chicken eaten was processed, which is high in sodium, preservatives, and saturated fats, which are linked to worse health outcomes."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Study subjects are self-reporting their diet &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is a common issue for long-term studies, as having researchers clock every meal thousands of participants eat for decades is obviously not going to happen. But it can affect the accuracy of these types of studies. "This study included a large number of participants over a long period of time, but self-reported diets can be inaccurate as people often underreport or under or overestimate," Gentile says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Other health factors weren't assessed in the study &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While blood pressure and some other metrics were part of the assessment, other things that have a big impact on someone's health weren't. "Physical activity wasn't documented in the study, which is a protector against all-cause mortality," Gentile says. "Other dietary factors weren't taken into consideration—even though participants generally followed a Mediterranean diet, men were more likely to consume larger portions, more meat than women, more alcohol, and less fruits and vegetables."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-should-you-stop-eating-chicken"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Should You Stop Eating Chicken? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The answer to this question isn't quite so simple—and Gentile says it would be hasty to stop eating chicken altogether. "This study doesn't prove that poultry is inherently harmful, but that certain patterns of eating may be linked to higher mortality, especially in older men who eat more than 10 to 11 ounces per week," Gentile says. "The average person eating a few servings of chicken per week, alongside a Mediterranean diet, doesn't need to panic, although we should always be thoughtful." Here's what Gentile suggests:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Opt for pasture-raised or organic chicken &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Organic or pasture-raised chicken may have less inflammatory and less questionable feed ingredients," Gentile says.
&lt;/p&gt;

Worried, she visited her doctor, who dismissed her concerns as changes that can occur after having a baby. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“In their words, not mine, I presented as if I had it together as if I was an energetic young mom who perhaps may have had different expectations of the physical, emotional ramifications of having a child,” Peters, now 43, of Los Angeles, tells TODAY.com. “Some of my physicians chalked it up to being related to childbirth, which ultimately delayed my diagnosis.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Over the next five years, the symptoms continued, and doctors assured Peters she was fine. She delivered two more children before finally undergoing a colonoscopy and ultimately being diagnosed with Stage 3 rectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Life immediately turned upside down overnight as it does for anybody when they get life (changing) news like that,” she says. “Cancer had been the furthest thing from my mind.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Increasing symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At first, Peters noticed blood on the toilet paper. As the years passed, the symptoms became more concerning.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It went from ribbons of blood in the poop to filling the bowl with blood,” she says. “It ultimately seemed like (I) had a period with the amount of blood that was coming out.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The texture of her stool changed, and it looked “shaggy” and smaller. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-04-848cf6.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-04-848cf6.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-04-848cf6.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-04-848cf6.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-04-848cf6.jpg" alt="Since her diagnosis with Stage 3 rectal cancer, Marisa Peters shares her story to raise awareness of the cancer.

After her third child’s “complicated” birth that included her rapidly losing blood, she eventually saw a gastroenterologist to approve a medication that she hoped would help manage her GI symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I went to that doctor and on telling her my symptoms, I’ll never forget her face. She was shocked and concerned,” Peters recalls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The doctor asked if Peters wanted a colonoscopy and at first, she demurred. At the time, she didn’t know that &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/news/colon-cancer-top-cause-death-young-people-rcna134218" target="_blank"&gt;colorectal cancer rates in young people were increasing&lt;/a&gt;. The doctor agreed they could skip the colonoscopy for now if Peters underwent other types of tests. If those results indicated a colonoscopy was needed, Peters agreed to return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We did a Cologuard test. We did a number of other lab-based tests,” she says. “Sure enough, the Cologuard test resulted positive.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Peters needed a colonoscopy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I got that colonoscopy, which revealed the tumor,” she says. “They got the biopsy back very quickly, so within 48 hours. It was a Wednesday that I got the call that it was confirmed cancerous.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The size of the tumor indicated it was late stage but doctors were unsure if it had spread to other parts of her body or invaded the rectal wall. Soon after undergoing scans, Peters learned she had Stage 3 rectal cancer in early summer 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The tumor was right at the top of my rectum, which was why it was causing that increased urgency to go to the bathroom,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Her treatment plan included six rounds of chemotherapy followed by 28 rounds of radiation with oral chemotherapy every week day for five and a half weeks. Following treatment, she underwent a 7-hour surgery where doctors removed the mass and reconstructed her rectum. To recover, she had an&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/woman-rectal-cancer-35-details-signs-comic-rcna197951?search=ilestomy" target="_blank"&gt; ileostomy&lt;/a&gt; for four months. Finally, she had six more rounds of chemotherapy before undergoing the surgery to reverse the ileostomy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“That is when I feel like the real battle started because you realize what has gone on in your life,” she says. “Thankfully, gratefully, miraculously I had a complete response to treatment.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Colorectal cancer in young people &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Over the past 30 years, the number of cases of colorectal cancer in young people has steadily risen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It is definitely increasing in young people,” Dr. David Rosen, a colorectal surgeon with the Center for Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer, who did not treat Peters, told &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/dad-35-blood-stool-1st-sign-colorectal-cancer-rcna194673" target="_blank"&gt;TODAY in 2025&lt;/a&gt;. “It continues to increase in young people even younger than 45.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-03-a9ef9e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-03-a9ef9e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-03-a9ef9e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-03-a9ef9e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-03-a9ef9e.jpg" alt="Since Marisa Peters was diagnosed with colorectal cancer at a younger age, her children will need to start screening earlier than most people."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Since Marisa Peters was diagnosed with colorectal cancer at a younger age, her children will need to start screening earlier than most people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Marisa Peters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Signs of colorectal cancer can include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bloody stool &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bleeding from the rectum&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Different bowel habits &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pain or pressure in the rectum&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Changes to the quality of stool, such as being narrow or loose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unexpected weight loss &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Abdominal cramps &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Treatments for rectal cancer can include chemotherapy, radiation and surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;'Never going to stop sharing'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;After her diagnosis and the completion of her treatment, Peters started a nonprofit called &lt;a href="https://beseen.care/" target="_blank"&gt;Be Seen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Our mission is to eradicate death by young onset colorectal cancer through three pillars. (One) that is focused in awareness and education. Again, that would have made a critical difference if I only knew,” she says. “The second is around access and research … And lastly, it’s not enough if people just know they have the tests, they have to take action. They need to get those colonoscopies or take a stool-based test.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;After her own experience, Peters feels it’s important to share information about colorectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-01-3e8dc6.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-01-3e8dc6.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-01-3e8dc6.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-01-3e8dc6.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-01-3e8dc6.jpg" alt="Raising awareness of colorectal cancer has become a family affair for Marisa Peters, her husband and three sons.

When liver function is impaired and ketone levels drop, memory and learning typically suffer—but physical activity can still counteract those effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests exercise triggers alternative brain-supporting mechanisms beyond just energy supply. With Alzheimer’s rates rising, these findings point to physical activity as a powerful tool for preserving brain health, especially in individuals with metabolic or liver-related challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ketones &amp;amp; Brain Health:&lt;/strong&gt; Ketones fuel memory and cognition when glucose is low.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Physical activity improved brain function even without ketone support.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wider Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may help people with liver conditions at higher dementia risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Missouri-Columbia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We know exercise is good for our body, but what about our brains? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from the University of Missouri suggests that exercise plays a crucial role in keeping our minds sharp, even when one of the brain’s key energy sources isn’t available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by Mizzou researchers Taylor Kelty and R. Scott Rector, offers fresh insight into brain health and suggests that exercise could play a bigger role in preventing cognitive decline than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109095"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and weights." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;When the body runs low on its usual fuel — glucose — the liver makes ketones, an alternative energy source that helps power the brain.  Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the number of Americans expected to develop Alzheimer’s disease more than doubling by 2060, this research raises an intriguing possibility: Could regular physical activity be the key to preserving memory and cognitive performance as we age?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the body runs low on its usual fuel — glucose — the liver makes ketones, an alternative energy source that helps power the brain. These molecules support cognitive memory, learning and overall brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what happens when the liver can’t produce enough of them? Can exercise help compensate for this ketone deficiency?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelty and Rector, the director of the Roy Blunt NextGen Precision Health building, were determined to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, the researchers looked at what happens when ketone production is limited in the liver. As expected, the result was a noticeable decline in brain function and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then, something remarkable happened: Exercise still managed to help reverse some of the cognitive decline, even with the ketone production impaired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Going into the study, we thought that with fewer ketones and the cognitive impairments that causes, exercise may not be able to overcome that impairment,” Kelty, a postdoctoral fellow in Rector’s lab, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But it seems like exercise is so powerful that there are other mechanisms going on in the brain that allow it circumvent those impairments and still receive the benefits from exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rector, who is also a professor in the School of Medicine, emphasized the complexity of exercise’s effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study highlights how exercise benefits the body in a multitude of ways, even when we don’t fully understand all the molecular mechanisms involved,” Rector said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even when we remove a single pathway, exercise is doing so many other things that it can help mitigate those deficiencies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are especially promising for people with liver conditions that prevent the body from making ketones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelty pointed out that the emerging field of liver-brain research is beginning to show that individuals with severe liver dysfunction have a higher risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If ketone production in the liver is disrupted, it could be a potential cause of cognitive decline, ultimately leading to conditions like dementia,” Kelty said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, this research helps raise awareness about the importance of ketone production on brain health and the impact exercise can have on staying mentally sharp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s so much we’re still uncovering, and with all the state-of-the-art resources and interdisciplinary collaborations at Mizzou, it’s exciting to think about where this research might take us next,” Kelty said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exercise could be a key piece of the puzzle in preserving brain health as we age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more than two decades at Mizzou, Rector said he’s proud to be part of a community that makes research like this possible.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The support we’ve received from Mizzou, the Division of Research, Innovation and Impact, and the NextGen Precision Health initiative has been incredible,” Rector said. “We hope our work will ultimately help a lot of people in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Cognitive impairment caused by compromised hepatic ketogenesis is prevented by endurance exercise” was published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Physiology&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and is a part of the NIH Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC), a national research consortium designed to discover the molecular mechanisms of how physical activity improves health and prevents disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this exercise and cognition research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#94f7fbfae7fdf3f8fdfbf6d4f9fde7e7fbe1e6fdbaf1f0e1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brian Consiglio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://missouri.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Missouri-Columbia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Brian Consiglio – University of Missouri-Columbia&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1113/JP287573" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cognitive impairment caused by compromised hepatic ketogenesis is prevented by endurance exercise&lt;/a&gt;” by Taylor Kelty et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Physiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive impairment caused by compromised hepatic ketogenesis is prevented by endurance exercise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extensive research has demonstrated endurance exercise to be neuroprotective. Whether these neuroprotective benefits are mediated, in part, by hepatic ketone production remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate the role of hepatic ketone production on brain health during exercise, healthy 6-month-old female rats underwent viral knockdown of the rate-limiting enzyme in the liver that catalyses the first reaction in ketogenesis: 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rats were then subjected to either a bout of acute exercise or 4 weeks of chronic treadmill running (5 days/week) and cognitive behavioural testing. Acute exercise elevated ketone plasma concentration 1 h following exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hepatic HMGCS2 knockdown, verified by protein expression, reduced ketone plasma concentration 1 h after acute exercise and 48 h after chronic exercise. Proteomic analysis and enrichment of the frontal cortex revealed hepatic HMGCS2 knockdown reduced markers of mitochondrial function 1 h after acute exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HMGCS2 knockdown significantly reduced state 3 complex I + II respiration in isolated mitochondria from the frontal cortex after chronic exercise. Spatial memory and protein markers of synaptic plasticity were significantly reduced by HMGCS2 knockdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These deficiencies were prevented by chronic endurance exercise training. In summary, these are the first data to propose that hepatic ketogenesis is required to maintain cognition and mitochondrial function, irrespective of training status, and that endurance exercise can overcome neuropathology caused by insufficient hepatic ketogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results establish a mechanistic link between liver and brain health that enhance our understanding of how peripheral tissue metabolism influences brain health.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 18:31:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE5ZUXg3OUwxcEtXb21SUmpZZ2l2TVEydEpKSXUxMHNWMlJVOW0yMm1veHZGYUp0bjFpakV1UnVPR3dCTUh6TlhPSG9hYVVLWjd6ZFhjNnh2WXdqY1BWWWVkR016ZHFoSTVyYVBQTVFn</guid></item><item><title>科学家在奶牛中发现禽流感–这就是可怕的原因- SciTechDaily | Scientists Found Bird Flu in Dairy Cows – Here’s Why That’s Terrifying - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxNY2RvOXU3UDNOSFBISE8xcmt4SW1CaUVEeEExT0p3c0FyMENRMFRIazRQeFhyMjEtRjJhV05OZ3pYeHdYZm1CTFFOX0FuWGdvel84N0REb19WNm1BUUxEQXNKYi1RNXB0dGQ2anBVRGpQUTA4STBHd3dtUkZ6czRmalV1SXBvS0hwajhLOXJhRE1EM3lST3FJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 17:59:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxNY2RvOXU3UDNOSFBISE8xcmt4SW1CaUVEeEExT0p3c0FyMENRMFRIazRQeFhyMjEtRjJhV05OZ3pYeHdYZm1CTFFOX0FuWGdvel84N0REb19WNm1BUUxEQXNKYi1RNXB0dGQ2anBVRGpQUTA4STBHd3dtUkZ6czRmalV1SXBvS0hwajhLOXJhRE1EM3lST3FJ</guid></item><item><title>为什么我们的思维有时会变得空白？ -神经科学新闻 | Why Do Our Minds Sometimes Go Blank? - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE1DWHlyVHE2aXR0TTFYem1wd3hWbHYxUndaSnZRaGhjTkllUU9sM3dVSnJwMS1SY0xqZzVDVHRjODhnZERSYlFpVDdIbWNUcWdCWXlTREYyVTZmcjAyRjdPZEJ1UzhDT212ZmZwOG1fUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Mind blanking—the experience of thinking about nothing—has often been misunderstood or lumped together with mind wandering. However, new research suggests it’s a distinct mental state linked to physiological arousal levels, with its own brain and body signatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mind blanks are common during prolonged attention, sleep deprivation, or physical fatigue, and involve disruptions in memory, attention, and language. By studying neural patterns during blank moments, scientists hope to better understand both everyday cognitive lapses and clinical conditions like anxiety, ADHD, and brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frequent Phenomenon:&lt;/strong&gt; People experience mind blanking about 5–20% of the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physiological Clues:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s associated with decreased heart rate, slower brainwaves, and local sleep states.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Relevance:&lt;/strong&gt; Mind blanking appears in anxiety, ADHD, brain injury, and sleep disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Cell Press&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind blanking is a common experience with a wide variety of definitions ranging from feeling “drowsy” to “a complete absence of conscious awareness.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an opinion article publishing April 24 in the Cell Press journal &lt;em&gt;Trends in Cognitive Sciences&lt;/em&gt;, a team of neuroscientists and philosophers compiles what we know about mind blanking, including insights from their own work observing people’s brain activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“During wakefulness, our thoughts transition between different contents. However, there are moments that are seemingly devoid of reportable content, referred to as mind blanking,” writes the research team, which formed as a result of collaboration at the 25th Annual Meeting of the Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness in Amsterdam in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It remains unclear what these blanks represent, highlighting the definitional and phenomenological ambiguities surrounding mind blanking.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, mind blanking has only been studied using research and experiments developed to study mind wandering—a similar internal experience in which our thoughts “flow seamlessly like a stream.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers argue that mind blanking is a distinct experience that involves feeling sleepier, more sluggish, and making more errors, and should be inspired by mind wandering research, but considered independently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We sought to better understand mind blanking by parsing through 80 relevant research articles—including some of our own in which we recorded participants’ brain activity when they were reporting that they were ‘thinking of nothing,’” explains author Athena Demertzi of GIGA Research at University of Liège, Belgium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeaways from their research include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mind blank frequency varies greatly between different people, but a person experiences the phenomenon about 5%–20% of the time on average. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Common experiences defined as “mind blanking” include lapses of attention, memory issues, and a cessation of inner speech, among others. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mind blanks tend to happen toward the end of long, sustained attention tasks like exams and after sleep deprivation or intense physical exercise, but are also a typical waking state.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) report mind blanking more frequently than neurotypical people. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mind blanking is part of the clinical description of generalized anxiety disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). It is also relevant to several other clinical conditions including strokes, seizures, traumatic brain injuries, and Kleine–Levin syndrome—which causes people to sleep up to 20 hours per day. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experiments observing brain activity during rest using technologies including fMRI and electroencephalography show that there are specific neural signatures in the frontal, temporal, and visual networks of the brain before a mind blank.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;During mind blanks after sustained attention tasks, people’s heart rates and pupil sizes decreased and their brains showed lower signal complexity—a state typically observed in unconscious people. During the blank, they observed disruptions in sensory processing and slow, sleep-like EEG waves. The authors describe these states in which parts of a person’s brain appear asleep as “local sleep episodes.” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An increase in neural activity in posterior cortical brain regions can also lead to mind blanking, as is the case when high-speed thinking leads to slower cognitive function. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When people were prompted to actively “empty their minds,” researchers observed deactivations in the inferior frontal gyrus, Broca’s area, supplementary motor cortex, and hippocampus.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers speculate that the common factor between different forms of blanking may be related to changes in arousal levels, leading to a malfunction of key cognitive mechanisms such as memory, language, or attention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that blanking experiences vary so greatly—both in terms of people’s subjective experiences and their neural activity—the researchers propose a framework that describes mind blanking as a dynamic group of physiologically driven experiences mediated by arousal states, or a person’s state of physiological “vigilance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they describe it, this means that when the brain is in a high- or low-arousal state, a mind blank is more likely to occur.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The experience of a ‘blank mind’ is as intimate and direct as that of bearing thoughts,” says author Jennifer Windt of Monash University in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our aim here is to start a conversation and see how mind blanking relates to other seemingly similar experiences, such as meditation,” adds author Antoine Lutz of the Lyon Neuroscience Research Center in France.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team hopes that acknowledging mind blanking as a distinct mental state in future research will help build toward a deeper understanding of mind blanking.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe that the investigation of mind blanking is insightful, important, and timely,” says lead author Thomas Andrillon of the University of Liège.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Insightful because it challenges the common conception that wakefulness involves a constant stream of thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Important because mind blanking highlights the interindividual differences in subjective experience. Collectively, we stress that ongoing experiences come in shades with varying degrees of awareness and richness of content.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was supported by funding from the European Research Council, the French Research Agency, the Belgian Fund for Scientific Research, the EU Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Marie Skłodowska-Curie RISE program, the European Cooperation in Science and Technology COST Action, the Léon Fredericq Foundation, and the University of Liège. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this mind blanking and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a1d1d3c4d2d2e1c2c4cdcd8fc2cecc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Julia Grimmett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://cell.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cell Press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Julia Grimmett – Cell Press&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2025.02.002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Where is my mind?

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVE DAVIES, HOST: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies. If you live in the United States, chances are good that you either are or know a parent whose child is being treated for ADHD - attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Last year, the Centers for Disease Control reported that more than 11% of American children had been diagnosed with ADHD - a record high. For 14-year-old boys, the figure was 21%. In a recent article for The New York Times magazine, journalist Paul Tough examines how ADHD is diagnosed and treated, often with commonly prescribed stimulants, such as ritalin and adderoll. Though they're regarded as highly effective and thus very popular, he finds three decades of scientific studies have raised questions about their efficacy and safety and about the nature of ADHD itself. Some researchers think the notion that ADHD is a distinct, identifiable brain disorder may be wrong or at least oversimplified, and that treatments other than medication should be considered. Paul Tough is a contributing writer to The New York Times magazine and the author of four books - most recently, "The Inequality Machine: How College Divides Us." Paul Tough, welcome to FRESH AIR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAUL TOUGH: Thank you. Great to be here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: You write that in the early '90s, there were rising rates of ADHD diagnoses - about 2 million American kids in 1993, roughly two-thirds of them taking Ritalin. This provoked protests from some, particularly the Church of Scientology, you know, arguing that you're drugging our kids. You write that you didn't have to be a Scientologist to acknowledge there were legitimate questions about ADHD. What were they?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: At that point, the questions were pretty basic. We didn't exactly understand what this condition was and what treatments were the right ones to use. So Ritalin - doctors could see, families could see that when kids took Ritalin, there was this - in many of them, this overnight change in their behavior. But we weren't sure why that was happening, and the diagnoses were expanding at such a great rate. There was also a question of why that was, why suddenly it had doubled in just a few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: So a massive study was organized by a number of researchers. Tell us how this was put together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Yes. So this was the Multimodal Treatment of ADHD Study, or MTA, and a number of researchers at six sites around the United States and Canada decided that they wanted to test different treatments of ADHD. So there were stimulant medications. Specifically, at that point, it was Ritalin. But there were also behavioral interventions, so coaching, parent training. And they wanted to see, scientifically, which would work best. So they did what scientists do, which is they created this randomized controlled study. And at each site in the United States and Canada, they divided the children who were between 7 and 9, who had been diagnosed with ADHD, into different treatment groups. So some got behavioral training. Some got Ritalin, and some were just left on their own to figure out their own treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: Right. The results were released in 1999. What did they show?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: That was after 14 months of treatment, and what they showed was that the most effective treatment for behavior, for symptoms, was Ritalin - that the kids who had taken Ritalin were doing significantly better than the other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: Over time, of course, more and more kids were diagnosed with ADHD. And you write about a guy named James Swanson who was at the University of California, Irvine, who, among others, grew uneasy about these trends in diagnosis and treatment. What was troubling them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: So there were two things that were really troubling James Swanson. And one was that that initial expansion of diagnoses from about a million kids to about 2 million kids - that made sense to him because scientists thought that about 3% was the most accurate guess of what percentage of children sort of naturally had ADHD, and 2 million was pretty close to 3%. But then it kept going up. So as the study was going on, it went up to 5%, to 6%, and he couldn't see a reason why that was happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other thing that he found disturbing was that he and the other scientists that were running the MTA study continued after those 14 months to carefully study the children who were in the original group. And what they noticed was that the advantage that the kids in the Ritalin group had had after 14 months - it started to really fade. And by 36 months, there was no difference in the symptoms of any of the groups. The kids who had taken Ritalin weren't doing better in terms of their symptoms than the children who had been assigned to the behavioral group, and they weren't even doing better than the kids who had not been given any treatment at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: You write that Swanson is now 80 years old and is troubled by the way ADHD research and treatment is going. Is there a kind of fundamental theme to his concern?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Yeah. I think mostly what he's concerned by is that that original study of the 14 months got a lot of attention, and the message really went out that Ritalin works, that it's the right treatment for most kids, but that the second study - the one that found that over time, those effects fade - that it did not get the same type of attention and that it's not reflected in the way that a lot of practitioners are now treating ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: And there's been a lot of research into what it actually is biologically, and has that guided treatment at all? I mean, I guess that's the question. Is there a real connection between the understanding of the biological origins of this and the way it's treated?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: One of the things that's so striking in talking to scientists, including neuroscientists, who've studied this is that they say that they actually understand the biology of ADHD less than they did 20 years ago. So normally, the course of science is that as time goes on, they get a better and better understanding of what's really going on in the brains of children with a particular diagnosis. And in this case, that's just not true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So 20 years ago, there was this belief that there were clear biomarkers, clear indications in the brain in terms of electrical signals or a particular gene that would predict ADHD or differences in the size and shape of certain parts of the brain that you could say, this kid has that biomarker. He does have ADHD, and this one does not. And as the last couple of decades have gone on, that belief has slowly been undermined so that now there is no clear biomarker for ADHD. And I think most neuroscientists accept that that's the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: This is such a big deal for parents. Nothing is more troubling than to see your child in pain or struggling. You have kids yourself, right? You have two sons?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: I do, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: Yeah. So you know the stakes here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: What are the - some of the things that they observe that make them so desperate for help?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: ADHD can be incredibly disruptive in a child's life, in a family's life, in a classroom. When kids are having trouble sitting still, focusing, getting work done, keeping themselves organized, controlling their impulses, it makes life really difficult. And it especially makes life difficult when you are going to school. A lot of the school day, you've got to sit still. You've got to focus. There's a lot of homework. I know as a parent. And when you are struggling with impulse control, when you're struggling with attention, those things are really difficult. And I think within families, that often leads to real conflict. And so what originally starts as just a problem in one child's life turns into a problem for a whole family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: And I guess one of the other things that's tricky about it as a diagnosis is that a lot of the things that you observe are also symptoms from other causes, such as, you know, injury to the head or other psychological conditions, anxiety and depression, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Yeah. So it is a very tricky disorder to diagnose for a lot of reasons. I mean, the first one is that the only way to do it is by using a symptom checklist that is in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. So there's this list of symptoms. If you have six symptoms, you officially have ADHD. If you have five, you don't. There are other criteria. It has to last for a certain amount of time. It has to exist in at least two different settings. But what makes it even more tricky is exactly what you're talking about, that there is great overlap between these symptoms and the symptoms of lots of other things, of early trauma, for instance, of anxiety, of depression. And to make it even more complicated, what the CDC has found is that there is a lot of overlap among children who are diagnosed with ADHD with other psychological problems. So about three-quarters of kids who have received an ADHD diagnosis have also received a diagnosis for another psychological disorder or a learning problem. And according to the DSM, if the symptoms of a child are better explained by another diagnosis, they shouldn't be diagnosed with ADHD. So that makes it really tricky, that there is sometimes overlap between two things, but you're only supposed to diagnose ADHD if it is the one that is causing these symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: The DSM you mentioned, that's the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which guides treatment for a lot of practitioners. I guess one of the other things that's a little hard to understand about this is that two kinds of symptoms for ADHD are pretty different, right? I mean, there's inattention, not paying attention. And then there's hyperactivity and impulsivity. And they seem like pretty different behaviors. Why is it assumed that they arise from the same condition?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Yeah, I think that's another part of the complication of this diagnosis. There are some doctors who think these are two entirely separate conditions, that each should have its own listing in the DSM. And, you know, in fact, over the years, there have been lots of different sort of envelopes around ADHD. Its name has changed. The symptoms that predict it have changed. There's clearly something going on in a lot of kids who are having trouble focusing, having trouble sitting still and paying attention. But in individual children, that expresses itself in lots of different ways. And that's another real struggle, I think, for clinicians, for families who are trying to figure out, you know, there's something going on with my kid - what is it? And ADHD, I think, has become this sort of catchall diagnosis that we use to just put together a lot of kids who may in fact be quite different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: You know, it seems kind of counterintuitive that stimulants would help with hyperactivity and impulse control, right? I mean, it seems like you're pushing it in the same direction that's the problem. What's the medical explanation for that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Well, I don't think we know exactly what's going on. But what studies of amphetamines, the drug at the root of the two most popular medications for ADHD, what amphetamines do is they help make whatever you're focused on seem more interesting. And so I think that then makes sense, right? If you're having impulse control, if you're distracted by everything else that's going on in the room, when you take this medication that makes whatever you're supposed to be looking at seem more interesting, it makes it easier to focus, easier to sit still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: So what are some of the nondrug treatments that are helpful in treating ADHD that people are discovering?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Scientifically, there is not yet any real data showing that there's any particular sort of parent training or behavioral techniques that makes things better, which I think is really frustrating for a lot of clinicians and a lot of parents, and I think, as a result, tends to make medication seem like a more attractive alternative. But lots of clinicians have found their own ways of working kids and with families that are just about, like, helping to create a calmer atmosphere in the classroom, a calmer atmosphere at home, you know, things as basic as, you know, Post-it notes and calendars and just ways of helping you organize your thoughts, organize your schoolwork if you're a kid in school. You know, none of those are a perfect cure, but a lot of them seem to help. And I think they're really individualistic. And, you know, a good clinician can help a family figure out the solutions or the tools, the interventions that are most helpful for that child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: You read about Russell Barkley, a prominent ADHD researcher. And he has a lecture that has been viewed more than 4 million times on YouTube, right? What is his perspective of the disorder?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Yeah, so he's written a lot about it, probably the most well-known, the most prominent doctor, scientist when it comes to popularizing our ideas about ADHD. And what he talks about in this speech is that ADHD is basically diabetes of the brain, so it's a chronic condition that you're going to have to treat for your whole life. And he tends to focus on the downsides of ADHD. He takes very seriously the real problems that can occur for kids and adults who have ADHD, including higher rates of, you know, traffic accidents, of early death, of drug addiction. And the way that he looks at ADHD is to look at it as this very much sort of black-and-white, yes or no diagnosis, like diabetes. If you've got it, you've got it. If you don't, you don't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: And you have to treat it because there'll be, you know, downstream effects that you really want to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Yes, exactly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: We need to take a break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Paul Tough. He is a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine. His recent cover story is titled "Have We Been Thinking About ADHD All Wrong?" We'll be back to talk more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(SOUNDBITE OF THE MOUNTAIN GOATS SONG, "PEACOCKS")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with New York Times contributing writer Paul Tough. He has a new cover story about attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and its diagnosis. It's titled "Have We Been Thinking About ADHD All Wrong?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to talk a bit about some of the research into the nature of this disorder. In 2002, you write, there was an international consensus statement signed by 85 researchers defending the validity of the diagnosis of ADHD because there had been questions about it. What was the thrust of their letter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Well, the main point of that consensus statement was exactly to defend the diagnosis against critics. And so a lot of that statement is just about the basic fact that this is a real diagnosis that has real consequences. What I was drawn to in that statement was the focus on biomarkers, on particular biological signatures that could let us identify ADHD and in the process say, this is clearly a biological condition, not just a psychological one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it focused on three particular biomarkers. One was certain electrical signals in the brain that seemed different in kids with ADHD than without. The other was on genetics. There were early indications in the early 2000s that there was a specific, single gene that predicted ADHD. And the third was about the kind of physical signatures you could see in the brain on MRIs, that there were differences in the volumes and sizes of particular parts of the brain in kids who had been diagnosed with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: And has that held up to further study?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: No, that part has not really held up to further study. It's become much more complicated - this search for the biomarker. And there are many scientists now who say that the search for a biomarker was just a red herring, that that's not what any scientists should be focused on. Instead, we should be focusing on the experience of kids with ADHD. So each of those three biomarkers that I mentioned have been undermined in one way or another. The study of these electrical signals, repeated studies to try to replicate that, turned up to have no result. Genetics is more complicated. There are still indications that certain combinations of genetic qualities are predictive of ADHD. But the very sort of simple and straightforward, you've got this gene, you've got ADHD, that scientists were hoping was the case 20, 25 years ago, that has proven not to be true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then the third is this idea that there are differences in the volume - the cortical volume, scientists say, in certain parts of the brain. And that was studied in this giant global study called the enigma study done by this consortium of neuroscientists and psychiatrists. And that similarly showed almost no difference between people with ADHD and people without. Among adults and adolescents, no difference at all. Among children, just a tiny difference in the cortical volume of certain parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: You write that you found a consensus of sorts among most scientists that you spoke to about this question of whether it's a biological condition. What's the consensus?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Well, the consensus is that there are clearly both biological and environmental causes somehow combining to create these symptoms in kids. But beyond that, there's not much consensus. There's not a clear agreement on the relative role that environment plays and that biology plays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: You know, so much of the discussion here focuses on kids because obviously, parents are really concerned about helping their kids and helping them grow and flourish. To what extent is this a growing diagnosis among adults?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: To a huge extent. So in this article, I focused on kids for a variety of reasons. Partly because the science is more clear because scientists have been studying ADHD in kids for much longer. But as a phenomenon, as a diagnosis in the United States, it is among adults that all of the growth is happening. So the fastest growing groups for the diagnosis are people - adults in their 20s and 30s. But even adults in their 40s, 50s, 60s, all of those diagnosis rates are going up really quickly, and prescription rates are going up by a huge degree, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: You know, it's interesting 'cause you mentioned this multimodal study earlier found that there were clear benefits to ritalin and, you know, stimulants, but that they tended to disappear after about 36 months. Do we know if that's also true of adults who take these medications?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: We don't. It just hasn't been studied to the same degree. I don't think there's reason to think that there's a different result that we would see among adults, but there hasn't been a similarly rigorous study like MTA for adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: This is such a common issue that we all know people in - that are dealing with this. And just over the past two days, just among the producers here at FRESH AIR, I've had one producer who has a son who struggles with some of this and finds the medication very helpful. And then I had another producer whose brother, when he was in second grade, had real trouble focusing and his teachers were struggling with him 'cause he was just all over the place. And they told his mom, look, you're going to have to put him on ritalin or one of these drugs, or otherwise, he can't come to school here. And the mom said, nope, I'm not doing that. And I know it's a public school, so you have to deal with him. He ended up in front of a school psychologist who taught him chess, and they began playing chess once a week. And, at least as my friend told the story, that was a real breakthrough. I mean, he really changed his behavior, and he's gone on. He's never taken medication. He's had a productive career as an artist, an animator and lives a happy life. So, I mean, an anecdote doesn't - isn't the same thing as research, but it just seems like there are a lot of ways this can go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Absolutely. Those are great stories. And, yes, so I - and I've heard lots of stories as well, not only in my reporting, but just from friends before the article came out, and then in great numbers since the article came out. And I think what's hard for us is that when we hear two different stories like that, it's hard for us not to think, well, just one of them has to be true. But the reality is they are both absolutely true, and that different people have different experiences of this condition and of its treatment. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. And so, to me, that is what is reassuring and even exciting about this new research. By giving young people and families the message that this is not just a sort of singular biological condition that you have or you don't have. That, in fact, symptoms often fluctuate over time. That there are different sorts of treatments that work for different sorts of kids. That that gives them maybe less certainty, which can sometimes be scary. But also more of a sense of possibility that this is something that can - like the young person you're talking to, who was sort of cured by chess - that there may be ways that life can change that will really change these symptoms, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: We're going to take another break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Paul Tough. He is a contributing writer for The New York Times magazine. His recent cover story is titled "Have We Been Thinking About ADHD All Wrong?" He'll be back to talk more after this short break. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(SOUNDBITE OF CHRIS THILE &amp;amp; BRAD MEHLDAU'S "INDEPENDENCE DAY")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies. We are speaking with New York Times magazine contributing writer Paul Tough. His recent cover story reported on the continued growth of diagnosis of ADHD - attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder - in the United States and on research that raises questions about the common treatment for ADHD - stimulants such as Ritalin and Adderall. He writes that some researchers are thinking of ADHD in a new way and considering new approaches to treatment. His article is titled "Have We Been Thinking About A.D.H.D. All Wrong?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know, it's interesting. You write that the roots of treatment for this disorder go way back to an experiment, I guess, in the 1930s by a Harvard-trained psychologist in Rhode Island, right? Tell us about this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Yeah. So this is a psychiatrist named Charles Bradley who ran a home for children with psychological problems in Rhode Island. And at the time - this was in the 1930s - Benzedrine, which is a kind of amphetamine, had become this really popular drug among jazz musicians, actually, and among college students who felt like it helped them focus. It sort of amped them up in various ways. And he thought, maybe I should try this on these kids. There was nothing that was seeming to help them. So he did a very small but rigorous experiment, where he gave 30 kids a daily dose of Benzedrine. And he noticed this - in about half of them, this vast change in their behavior. So they were more placid. They were more easygoing. They could get things done. They felt better about their work. And it felt to him like this kind of miracle cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: And later, researchers followed up on this and did similar experiments. What did they find?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Yeah, so I spoke to this NYU researcher named Xavier Castellanos who actually told me about the Charles Bradley paper and said that he sees the same things now when he first prescribes Ritalin or Adderall to kids - that overnight, there's this kind of miraculous transformation for a lot of them, that their behaviors really change. What he said was frustrating, though, was that when you look at the sort of academic results for kids, even though they are able to sit and focus more and get more seat work done, their test scores don't go up. And that, I think, has been this puzzle that doctors have been wrestling with for the past couple of decades, that at least in the short term, these medications seem to have a powerful effect for some kids on their symptoms. But over time, they don't seem to have an effect on academic achievement, at least in - measured in test scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: Yeah. There's another test that you described involving putting stuff in knapsacks. Explain this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: So I'd never heard of this test before. It's called the knapsack test. But apparently, it's pretty common in psychology and computer science. You give a kid a backpack. In this case, it's a virtual backpack. And it's just this kind of game. You give them a bunch of different things of different weights and prices, and you say, what's the best way to pack this backpack to get the most value of stuff into it? So it's a little sort of logical puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And these researchers in Australia gave this test to a bunch of young adults, and they tested how well they did when they were on stimulant medication and how well they did when they were not. And what they found was that when they were on stimulant medication, they, from the outside, looked to be doing much better. They were working more quickly. They were more diligent. They were more focused. But when they looked at the results of how well they were doing on this knapsack test, they weren't doing any better. And what they saw was that that was because they weren't actually making better decisions. They were just sort of randomly pulling things in and out of their backpack instead of focusing on it. So what I think some researchers believe is that this is a clue to why sometimes behavior in the classroom can improve on stimulant medication, but academic results don't. It's possible that these stimulants make you sit still and behave better, but they're not actually helping your brain process information better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: You mentioned some other things that were troubling about continued use of these stimulants. What were some of the other issues that came up?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Yeah. So James Swanson - the researcher who helped lead the MTA study - one data point that he really focuses on in thinking about this as a long-term treatment rather than a short term-one is that in the original MTA study, when young people took stimulant medication over the course of years, it had an effect on their growth, on their physical growth, on their height - that the kids who had consistently taken Ritalin were about an inch shorter than the kids who had not. And so Swanson and the other MTA researchers have continued to study this group through adolescence and even into adulthood. And the most recent study looked at them when they were 25 and continued to see this height differential. That the ones who had consistently taken stimulant medication all the way through childhood and even young adulthood - they continued to be about an inch shorter than the ones who had stopped taking it or who had never started at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: Is there an explanation for that biologically that we know of?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: There isn't a definite explanation, no. We don't exactly know why that is. The most sort of logical one is that these medications affect appetite in a big way. So when I would talk to young people who were taking these medications, that was the thing that they talked about the most, that it - you just don't want to eat. And if you're an adolescent and you don't want to eat, you're very different than other adolescents. This is a time when kids are eating a ton, and that's helping their growth. So that would make sense as part of the reason for this, but there haven't been enough careful studies to say that that's the real reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: I mean, these are amphetamines, right? I mean, can they be addictive?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Amphetamines, as a whole, can be addictive. The way that the medications are formulated, especially the ones that release the medication over an extended time, over the course of a day - those are certain safeguards that make them less likely to be addicted. The young people I talked to who took these medications did not feel that they were addicting at all. They found them very easy to stop. So yes, they can be addictive. There's certainly anecdotal stories about people who become dependent or even addicted to these medications, but that doesn't seem like a very big problem for most kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: We are speaking with Paul Tough. He is a contributing writer for The New York Times magazine. His recent cover story is titled "Have We Been Thinking About A.D.H.D. All Wrong?" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(SOUNDBITE OF BRITTANY HOWARD SONG, "POWER TO UNDO")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Paul Tough. He's a contributing writer for The New York Times magazine. He has a recent cover story about the continued growth of diagnosis of ADHD - attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder - in the U.S. and on research that raises questions about the most common treatments. His article is titled "Have We Been Thinking About A.D.H.D. All Wrong?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Tough, you spoke to students across the country about this - with ADHD diagnosis - who'd been taking these stimulants. What did you hear?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Well, I heard a variety of things. So I think every young person's experience is unique. But mostly, I felt like they had a pretty complex relationship to these drugs. So I think the way that these medications and the diagnosis in general is portrayed in the public is that this is, you know, a medical condition that has a medical solution. And in fact, the young people I talked to saw this as much more of a kind of constant negotiation between them and their medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of the young people I talked to talked about - used the word sacrifice when they talked about their stimulant medication. They saw that there were benefits to it. They saw that it was going to help them in some significant way going forward in life. But they didn't actually like the experience of taking them, often not at all. I mean, one of them said, I just hate taking it. You know, you, first of all, get this real rush. You feel like you're on top of the world, but then there's a real crash. And so he didn't love it, but he saw, like, that in certain circumstances, it was the right thing to do. And that's what I heard from a lot of kids, that they had gotten to the point where they knew what this medication would make them feel like. And rather than think of it as, say, diabetes medication - something you've got to take every day in order to survive - it was much more situational. It was something that they would take at certain times and certain moments, and then other times not take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: Yeah. There was this one guy that - who you called Cap, who used it when he was preparing for his SAT exams and for baseball and baseball practice 'cause he could really focus on pitches, and he thought it made him a better hitter. But he didn't like it. And I guess people felt that it changed their personalities in some ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Yeah. That was something that I heard from a lot of people, that their sort of love of life, their sense of humor - that a lot of that would change when they were on this medication, that they were - you know, at lunch, they were not the happy, social person that they had been. One of them said, you know, it's not like I'm unhappy. It's just like I'm kind of flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was one girl who I spoke to, who I didn't include in the article, who talked about how it did sort of suppress her emotions. And she said that she had been having this day a couple of days before I spoke to her when her friends were going off to college, and she wanted to say goodbye to them all. And she decided that day not to take her medication because she wanted feel. She wanted to have this emotional connection, and she knew that if she was on the medication, she just would feel more flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: You wrote that there are some people who believe that ADHD is a clear, you know, identifiable biological disease and therefore best treated with medication, but that increasingly, people think that it may be thought of not as a condition that you have but as something that you experience. What exactly does that mean? What are the implications of that idea?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Well, I think this is where this question gets really interesting to me. And the person who I think is sort of leading the way - the researcher who's leading the way on this is a British researcher named Edmund Sonuga-Barke who has been studying ADHD for 35 years. And in the last few years, he has really started to change his approach, and I think that's been influential in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So he talks about ADHD as not having any kind of natural cutting point where you can say this person has it and this person does not have it, but instead that ADHD symptoms exist on a continuum, where almost everyone has some of these symptoms, and that there are some who - for whom it is really an extreme problem, but there's not a natural cutting point. And to him, this distinction is important not only scientifically, but also kind of, like, psychologically and emotionally, that it enables us to tell young people that this is not just a case of them having a deficit of a certain skill and that that's a disorder that has to be treated medically, but instead that their problems may have more to do with a misalignment between their own unique brain and the situation that they're in. And if that's the case, sometimes medication can still help make that environment more tolerable. But there also might be things that we could change in their environment, that they could change in their habits and patterns that would have the same kind of positive result that medication would have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: Right. I mean, school is sometimes just going to be boring, and if your particular brain has a hard time focusing on boring stuff, I guess it's harder. What are the implications of that for treatment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: You know, it's interesting. It might not have implications for treatment, but it changes, I think, the way you think about your treatment and the way you think about yourself, the way you think about your own brain. I think when we give kids the message that this is a brain-based problem, that it's a disorder in the brain, that's something that they take in as a sort of identity, as a message about who they are and what they can accomplish. And if instead it is portrayed, I think, more accurately as a mismatch between where you are and how your brain works, that says something very different to kids. It says maybe medication is the right thing right now, but it's also possible that in the future, this is going to change, that you're going to find your way to another kind of situation that's not like high school English class, where your brain is actually going to be really powerful and really well suited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: There was one thing that you mentioned in the research - that some children with ADHD symptoms are at greater risk of more serious issues, and those are kids whose symptoms are accompanied by intense angers. I mean, what are the different risks there?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Yeah. So this is the research of a researcher in Oregon named Joel Nigg. And I think this is really important. I think that one of the downsides of us having perceived this condition as this sort of yes or no, black or white disorder is that it has obscured the fact that there are really lots of different degrees of intensity of ADHD. So, you know, the young guy I talked to who, you know, was using it for baseball as much as he was using it for school - he almost certainly does not have a really intense case of ADHD. But there are lots of kids who do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what Joel Nigg has found is that between 30 and 40% of young people diagnosed with ADHD also have symptoms of intense anger as children and that that is often the beginning of real psychological problems. When you have both hyperactivity in impulse control and intense emotional dysregulation, that's a real warning sign, and that those kids - it's not just about changing their environment. They really do need treatment, which might include stimulant medication, but it also might include other things. That those young people have - are more likely to have coexisting other disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, depression, anxiety. And so they need a more careful set of treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: You know, I'm sure we're going to get a lot of reaction to this interview because it affects so many people, and people's experiences are all unique, and there is disagreement about this. You know, I happened to look at this magazine called ADDitude - that's A-D-D-itude - you're familiar with this - which describes itself as the nation's leading source of important news, expert advice and judgment-free understanding for families and adults living with attention deficit disorder. I just went to the website and right away was struck by a story attacking your article, calls it misrepresentative, biased and dangerous. Have you looked at this stuff?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: I have, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: Yeah. I mean, it specifically says that, in some cases, you quoted people who you didn't interview. Wes Crenshaw says he told a Times fact-checker before the article was published that the reporter's information was incorrect and asked for an interview to set the record straight, none was granted. Generally, what do you say about?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Well, I'll say first that that particular claim that Wes Crenshaw asked for an interview is not true. So the reason that ADDitude is responding so intensely, I think, is because I wrote about this magazine, about ADDitude, in my article. And one of the things that I noticed in ADDitude was that there were a number of articles aimed at parents of children who were resisting the diagnosis and resisting medication treatment. And I'd talked to a lot of these kids - right? - who were themselves being treated and who had really mixed feelings about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so the idea that parents need a strategy to persuade their kids to take medication felt really out of keeping with the research that I was reading - that medication works for some kids but it doesn't work for all kids, that on the whole, the benefits of stimulant medication outweigh the deficits for most people, but for individual kids, sometimes it is not the right choice. And I don't think that it's the job of parents to try to persuade their kids to keep taking this medication when they don't want to. You know, the research shows that lots of them don't want to, and lots of them stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so these articles from ADDitude magazine that I mentioned, that they're responding to, were all in one way or another trying to give parents arguments and approaches to try to convince their kids to take this medication. And so that's what I wrote about. It's true I didn't go follow up and interview these people because I was just quoting accurately the articles that they wrote in this magazine. And I think that the magazine felt wounded by the fact that I identified these articles as being a part of that movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: You know, the human mind is an awfully complicated thing, to say the least. And there are, you know, many circumstances in treatment in which medications are effective for reasons that just aren't clear, right? I think that is true of a lot of antidepressants - right? - for a long time. I don't know if it still is. And I'm just wondering, as you looked at this research on ADHD, are there people who are optimistic that they will get to a clearer understanding of its origin?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: I think so, yeah. I mean, I think there's a mix of feelings about it. I think there are hopes that that sort of, you know, intense scientific research will help us. But I think there are more people, and this is including some of the researchers who I wrote about, who say that that's not where our research focus is going to be most useful, that there may be two directions that seem most useful. One is what Joel Nigg is doing and trying to figure out if there are subtypes within this group that is diagnosed with ADHD who have different problems, different maybe genetic signatures and different needs for treatment. And instead of saying you've got ADHD or you don't, if we can be more precise in what intensity of ADHD, what type of ADHD you have, we can give you more helpful treatment suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then I think the other angle that I find really reassuring is to think about environments. So instead of to think of this as just a biological problem that has a biological solution, think about the environmental side of it. And a lot of the research suggests that as environments change for young people, their symptoms change as well. But mostly what we see is that just kind of happens as you go through life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is not a big push and I think there hasn't been a lot of study of, if we are actually intentional about how we change young people's environments, can we predictably make a difference in their symptoms? My hope is that those two strands of research together will make a real difference, that we not only will be able to say, well, this is the particular signature of ADHD that you have, but we'll also be able to say, and this is the kind of intervention, whether environmental or pharmaceutical, that might help your symptoms the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: Well, Paul Tough, thank you so much for speaking with us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: Paul Tough is a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine. His recent cover story is titled "Have We Been Thinking About ADHD All Wrong?" Coming up, Martin Johnson reviews a new tribute to Anthony Braxton, who Johnson says is one of the most polarizing figures in jazz.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmhsw00223575li0yds6t@published"&gt;My wife, “Lanna,” and I are in a dispute over what should be a normal childhood milestone for our daughter, “Tillie.” Tillie is now 8 and has never had a bicycle. I first suggested getting her one when she turned 4, but Lanna was vehemently opposed to the idea because she was convinced that our daughter would injure herself. Tillie is an active child with no disabilities that would impair her ability to ride a bike. Each year I have brought this up with my wife, but there’s always a reason she vetoes it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="141" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmhwt00263575fgl08xyz@published"&gt;When I suggested getting Tillie a bike last Christmas, Lanna refused, claiming Tillie would “take off somewhere and get run over or kidnapped.” Tillie is growing increasingly upset over not having a bike of her own and being able to ride with her friends (who have been riding since before kindergarten) and has had numerous fights with her mother over this. When I asked Lanna what age she would be comfortable with allowing our daughter to have a bike, her reply was “maybe 13 or 14.” I think this is completely unreasonable, but she refuses to budge. I am concerned that Tillie will not only miss out on a central part of childhood, but also that her relationship with her mother will be damaged. What can I do to get my wife to see how out of line her position is?&lt;/p&gt;

And I suppose I am a bit sympathetic, since I am a giant baby who can’t stand the sight of blood. Your wife’s fear that Tillie might injure herself—like many of the worries and anxieties we have for our kids—is not necessarily unreasonable, in and of itself. But that doesn’t mean that Lanna can reasonably base all parenting decisions on that fear, or Tillie would never get to do or experience anything.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="149" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmi5k002b35754vlj7e8x@published"&gt;When talking with Lanna, I wouldn’t focus on the fact that you think she’s wrong or being ridiculous or harming her relationship with Tillie. I would instead try to talk in positive terms about what you both want for Tillie. Presumably, you want her to be brave, confident, and independent enough to try new things. You want to shield her from unnecessary danger without limiting her opportunities to learn and explore. You want to raise her in a supportive environment and let her know that you believe in her. You want her to be able to figure out hard things and learn how to solve problems (and know that she can!), develop resilience, and ultimately grow up to trust in herself and her ability. You don’t want her to always worry that she won’t be able to do something, or refrain from trying because she thinks she might fail.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="144" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmiag002c3575vtcjdefl@published"&gt;I’m guessing that if Lanna is this worried about a very typical kid thing like riding a bike, it’s probably not the only way her anxiety over Tillie manifests. If she does have rather excessive anxiety as a parent and it’s interfering with the opportunities Tillie has to learn and have fun, then I think it’s important for Lanna to try to recognize what’s going on, acknowledge the impact on Tillie, and perhaps seek whatever support may be necessary to help her manage that anxiety. Again, it’s so natural to be worried about our kids; to not want to see them threatened or hurt—that’s always going to be the case! But we shouldn’t let our understandable worries and anxieties interfere with their daily lives, make them question their own abilities, or prevent them from doing the normal, fun things they really want to do.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="160" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmigh002f3575daishwhq@published"&gt;I am a cis woman in my early 30s who has known for a while that I am not interested in having biological children (and I’m not that interested in having non-biological children, either). I have a partner, and he is in agreement with me on this. The issue is my parents. They want me to have kids, and while they are kind of trying to be respectful about my decision, it’s clear they think that I’m too young to have decided, that I might change my mind, or that I’m just saying it to be dramatic. Compounding this is the fact that I’ve had some pretty serious medical issues that would make having a kid difficult, if not traumatic; when I’ve brought this up as a point in favor of not reproducing, I have been met with dismissal over my legitimate fears (pain and potentially life-threatening complications) to the tune of “but you’d have a baby at the end.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="120" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmiii002g3575lbwjrol8@published"&gt;I worry that I wouldn’t have their support if I had to pursue medical interventions for my health issues that would prevent me from having kids, but when I have brought this up as a possibility, they have also dismissed it. For the record, I like kids, and my younger sister has always wanted kids and will probably have them in the next few years, so I am not depriving my parents of grandchildren. I often find myself arguing with them in my head, trying to get them to support my decision. How do I handle these frustrating feelings I have toward my (very lovely!) parents when it feels like they don’t respect this major life decision I have made?&lt;/p&gt;

I understand why you feel frustrated, disappointed, and kind of judged. You asked what to do about those feelings, and I think it’s important to acknowledge them. It’s okay to be upset or annoyed; to wish that your parents understood and accepted where you’re coming from.&lt;/p&gt;

Ultimately, you don’t need your parents’ approval or even their acceptance in this, and I hope they can eventually grasp the fact that your reproductive decisions have nothing to do with them. It’s up to you and only you to make the choices you feel are best for your health and wellbeing. If you’re sure about what’s right for you, that’s what matters most—try to let that be all the affirmation you need.&lt;/p&gt;

Alicia has never really bonded with her sister, and when I asked her about what she wanted to do for her birthday party, she said she wants to have one without her sister being there.&lt;br&gt;When I tried to explain to her how sad that would be for Mariana and asked her to imagine how she would feel if Mariana wanted to leave her out, she said she wouldn’t care. She has been very persistent in her desire not to have Mariana at her party, so much so that she has even told us we could make it her “present.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmj5b002o35757oh6kmrr@published"&gt;Now my husband is actually starting to think that she shouldn’t have to include Mariana if she doesn’t want to “because it’s her birthday,” and has suggested we leave her at home with a sitter. Mariana is old enough to understand being excluded and I won’t agree to something so hurtful. This is becoming so much of an issue I am considering not having a party for Alicia at all. How can I resolve this?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="145" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmjen002r35758bpae36o@published"&gt;If it weren’t for the way Alicia seems so determined to leave her little sister out, I wouldn’t make a huge deal out of the party itself. I think it’s pretty common for families to hold a family birthday celebration as well as a separate party for a kid’s friends? Plus, a 3-year age gap means there won’t always be a natural overlap when it comes to friend groups or interests. My kids have had birthday friend-parties their sibling didn’t attend, not because they flat-out weren’t welcome but because they just might not have been super interested in or ready for whatever the party activity happened to be. My older child is 17, so for years now she’s often had some sort of birthday hangout with her friends and no one else; that doesn’t mean she doesn’t love her little sister or want her around.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="100" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmjhj002s3575o7vr8y0v@published"&gt;What you’re talking about sounds like something else, though, since you say that Alicia has never really bonded with Mariana. I understand why you might want to tell Alicia that if she has a party, Mariana has to at least have the option of tagging along, partly to establish the basic expectation of kindness and inclusion in your family. If that’s the decision, you and your husband can in turn make sure that Mariana is entertained and not disrupting Alicia’s fun with her friends (perhaps inviting one friend of Mariana’s to keep her company, if you think that would help?).&lt;/p&gt;

I understand why you’d find that upsetting or sad. But it won’t necessarily be like this forever. Sibling relationships change all the time. Separate from the birthday party conversation, try to talk with Alicia about her feelings about her little sister, do your best to listen and understand what those feelings are based on. You need to know what she’s thinking and feeling—and why—if you want to help her think about her sister differently and express her feelings in less hurtful ways.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr. vowing to reexamine the childhood vaccination schedule, measles and other previously eliminated infectious diseases could become more common. A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2833361"&gt;new analysis&lt;/a&gt; published today by epidemiologists at Stanford University attempts to quantify those impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Using a computer model, the authors found that with current state-level vaccination rates, measles could reestablish itself and become consistently present in the United States in the next two decades. Their model predicted this outcome in 83 percent of simulations. If current vaccination rates stay the same, the model estimated that the US could see more than 850,000 cases, 170,000 hospitalizations, and 2,500 deaths over the next 25 years. The results appear in the Journal of the American Medical Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“I don’t see this as speculative. It is a modeling exercise, but it’s based on good numbers,” says Jeffrey Griffiths, professor of public health and community medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston, who was not involved in the study. “The big point is that measles is very likely to become endemic quickly if we continue in this way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The United States declared measles eliminated in 2000 after decades of successful vaccination campaigns. Elimination means there has been no chain of disease transmission inside a country lasting longer than 12 months. The current measles outbreak in Texas, however, could put that status at risk. With more than 600 cases, 64 hospitalizations, and two deaths, it’s the largest outbreak the state has seen since 1992, when 990 cases were linked to a single outbreak. Nationally, the US has seen &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;800 cases of measles so far in 2025&lt;/a&gt;, the most since 2019. Last year, there were 285 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“We’re really at a point where we should be trying to increase vaccination as much as possible,” says Mathew Kiang, assistant professor of epidemiology and population health at Stanford University and one of the authors of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Childhood vaccination in the US has been on a downward trend. Data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from state and local vaccination programs found that from the 2019–2020 school year to the 2022–2023 school year, coverage among kindergartners with state-required vaccinations &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm"&gt;declined from 95 percent to approximately 93 percent&lt;/a&gt;. Those vaccines included MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis), polio, and chickenpox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In the current study, Kiang and his colleagues modeled each state separately, taking into account their vaccination rates, which ranged from 88 percent to 96 percent for measles, 78 percent to 91 percent for diphtheria, and 90 percent to 97 percent for the polio vaccine. Other variables included demographics of the population, vaccine efficacy, risk of disease importation, typical duration of the infection, the time between exposure and being able to spread the disease, and the contagiousness of the disease, also known as the basic reproduction number. Measles is highly contagious, with one person on average being able to infect 12 to 18 people. The researchers used 12 as the basic reproduction number in their study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 16:55:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPZWxEVExubzVqYVVjWlJDd3pUQm9aSXhQbzNqVGJIeGNqVTdWTWkxZkxENllGamxZTnRfYkJETU1iZ3VVWVlVc0tkLVl1NW82dFA5T1FYY0NHdnpjSE03UGZLeWN5QUd5dWJSSmR0QUZONFpSdGVMQVVIY0tXNzFKQTBYZkRjYnFrTGNYSnQyaDZEN2pLWmZnODZIY0tYZHZ3aXNtT2VWVTA3ekU</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，帮助您排便的最佳乳制品- EatingWell | The Best Dairy Product to Help You Poop, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxPNERFWExiVHBTOGw4VGRKMWhodjlJd0dNWWFEeHp1b3cwcTFzV005YXNaV2I5aEN0Ni1VaHR1X3pwc2kwaTYxYVVKUlZOZ3UyOXk3YzRxcm85YnRRNWVjSEs4dzdMUzA2dmttT3V2ZHk5TWdXVHM4UmVXcFR6RGwzYg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-blockquote" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By now, you’ve probably heard that a healthy gut microbiome (the trillions of bacteria that inhabit your intestines) is key to consistent, comfortable bowel movements. One of the best ways to maintain a thriving microbiome is to “feed” it foods high in probiotics. Kefir certainly fits the bill. “Kefir contains over 30 probiotic strains—way more than most supplements,” says&lt;a href="https://nutritionresolution.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Alyssa Simpson, RDN, CGN, CLT&lt;/a&gt;, a digestive health dietitian in Phoenix.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chronic inflammation doesn’t just increase the risk of chronic diseases, it can also take a toll on digestive health and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7944613/inflammation-might-be-the-reason-you-cant-poop-heres-what-to-do-about-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;contribute to constipation&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, kefir may help quell an inflamed digestive tract, leading to more frequent bowel movements. “Kefir may reduce gut inflammation, improving gut barrier function—changes that are known to support motility,” says Simpson. She points to a study in which peptides, bioactive compounds and probiotic strains in kefir positively affected inflammation and intestinal permeability, which is important for nutrient absorption and preventing harmful substances from entering the bloodstream.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Diarrhea is often the chief symptom of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290640/lactose-intolerance-symptoms-causes-what-to-eat-and-more/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lactose intolerance&lt;/a&gt;, but in about 30% of cases, it manifests with constipation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If your intolerance causes you to get backed up, you might want to keep kefir on hand. “Studies have shown kefir may improve lactose digestion for those who are lactose-intolerant but are still looking for dairy’s nutrition and health benefits,” says Kelley.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And since kefir is low in lactose to begin with, it can be a helpful dairy product for people who’d like to reap nutrients like protein and calcium without creating unpleasant GI symptoms.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can use kefir in many of the same ways as yogurt—but since it’s drinkable, you can start by consuming it as a beverage. Keep in mind, kefir has a strong taste that can take some getting used to. If you find its flavor too potent for solo drinking, you might prefer to use it in recipes. “Add it to smoothies, homemade dressings or even overnight oats to give your gut variety,” Kelley suggests.

A few additional strategies to prevent constipation include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat Enough (but Not Too Much) Fiber:&lt;/strong&gt; Fiber adds bulk and softness to stool, making it essential for regular BMs. Just note that there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; such a thing as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8043390/too-much-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;overdoing it&lt;/a&gt;. “Fiber can help, but more isn’t always better—focus on the types your gut tolerates, introduce it slowly and listen to how your body responds,” says Simpson. Ideally, aim for 25 grams of fiber per day for women and 38 grams for men.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay On Top of Hydration:&lt;/strong&gt; According to Simpson, dehydration is a common culprit behind &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7911394/the-fastest-way-to-relieve-constipation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;constipation&lt;/a&gt;. To hydrate adequately, aim for about 11.5 cups of fluid per day for women and 15.5 cups for men.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Plenty of Activity:&lt;/strong&gt; Research shows that regular exercise can be a helpful treatment for constipation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Whether it’s taking your dog for a walk, mowing the lawn or taking a cardio dance class, finding ways to stay active throughout the day can go a long way in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-before-in-the-morning-to-help-you-poop-11718405" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;keeping you regular&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to helping you poop, not all dairy products are created equal. Among the many dairy products, kefir has the best track record for getting bowels moving. This fermented beverage provides gut-healthy probiotics to support optimal digestive health. Enjoy kefir as a stand-alone drink or add it to sweet or savory recipes for a tangy, gut-healthy boost.&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of health researchers at the National Institute of Gastroenterology, in Italy, has found an association between regularly eating poultry and early death due to digestive system cancers. In their study &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/8/1370" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Nutrients&lt;/i&gt;, the group analyzed health-related data for 4,869 adults living in Italy over a 20-year period.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Prior research has suggested that eating &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/poultry/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;poultry&lt;/a&gt; (mainly chicken) is healthier than eating &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/red+meat/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;red meat&lt;/a&gt; as a protein source because it poses less risk of contributing to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cardiovascular+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; and some gastrointestinal cancers. But now, this latest research suggests eating chicken on a regular basis could be linked to certain types of gastrointestinal cancers and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/early+death/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;early death&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data for this study was collected during interviews and by &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/medical+staff/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medical staff&lt;/a&gt; conducting health examinations. Each of the people studied also filled out questionnaires regarding their eating habits. Their health status was evaluated using medical records and regional databases that allowed the team to include deaths in the study as well. One of the factors they looked at included how often subjects ate meat or poultry; another was the rate of development of gastrointestinal cancers and resulting deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found a higher incidence of gastrointestinal cancer development and also early deaths related to those cancer cases among people who ate more than 300 grams of poultry per week. The risk of dying at that level, they found, was 27% higher compared to people who ate just 100 grams of poultry per week or less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team acknowledges that more research is required to understand their findings. They were not able to determine, for example, if the increased rate of death from eating poultry was due directly to consuming the poultry or if it was related to how it was cooked, such as whether it was fried or breaded, or if certain seasonings were added. Also, while the study adjusted for some health and lifestyle factors, one potentially serious limitation was physical activity, such as amount and types of exercise, was not measured.&lt;/p&gt;

            Concerned that the nation’s health leadership is casting unfounded doubt on the safety of well-studied vaccines and may take action to curb their use, a group of public health experts is working to put pieces in place to respond.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9v7ud4z00023b6ohbnie1dk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The initiative, the Vaccine Integrity Project, will be funded by a foundation backed by Walmart heiress Christy Walton and has a steering committee helmed by former US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg and former National Academy of Medicine President Dr. Harvey Fineberg, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, who is leading the initiative and who serves as director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9v7ud4z00033b6o0i8qxetc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The effort will consider what’s needed to safeguard vaccine policy and use in the US, including whether there’s a need for a new independent body to evaluate vaccine safety and effectiveness, Osterholm said ahead of Thursday’s announcement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9v7ud4z00043b6oozra7zcg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There have been conversations happening for months now across the public health community about, ‘what will we do if US government vaccine information becomes corrupted or the system that helps to ensure their safety and efficacy are compromised?’ “ he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The initiative is being formed in response to actions by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has spread &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/08/health/measles-outbreak-urban-areas/index.html"&gt;mixed messages&lt;/a&gt; about the measles vaccine amid a deadly outbreak, accused advisers to federal health agencies of conflicts of interest and pledged to start a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/10/health/kennedy-autism-causes/index.html"&gt;major autism study&lt;/a&gt; that experts fear will falsely tie the condition to vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In a statement Thursday, HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon called the project “a self-appointed echo chamber masquerading as oversight.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Led by establishment leaders, it’s less about integrity and more about salvaging the credibility of a public health bureaucracy that failed millions during the COVID-19 pandemic,” he said. He added that Kennedy and NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya “will continue to prioritize open scientific debate and Gold Standard of Science to inform decision making.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9v7ud4z00063b6ompvxyycb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Vaccine Integrity Project’s first move will be to hold a series of information-gathering sessions, pulling together experts from local public health departments, medical associations, academia, public policy, industry and others.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The initial goal is to determine “what is important to have going forward if, in fact, there should be compromise by the federal government in terms of our vaccine enterprise,” Osterholm said. “We can’t say at this point that that’s happened, but we don’t want to wait until the moment it might happen, and we have enough signals that that is.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9v7ud4z00083b6otw7eef2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He pointed to Kennedy’s vaccine comments, as well as moves like some Minnesota state legislators’ introduction of &lt;a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?number=HF3219&amp;amp;type=bill&amp;amp;version=0&amp;amp;session_year=2025&amp;amp;session_number=0" target="_blank"&gt;a bill&lt;/a&gt; this week “to declare that mRNA vaccine technology is a weapon of mass destruction and that it should be immediately taken off the market and anyone using it would be liable for criminal activity.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9v7ud4z00093b6oo96hiqb5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Who’s going to respond to that?” Osterholm asked. “Is anybody at the federal government level going to respond to activities like that? That’s a question I think we are left, at this point, unanswered.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vkh0650002356o1w0msd68@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hamburg and Fineberg wrote in an opinion piece about the project in the health publication &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/24/vaccine-integrity-project-acip-cdc-fda-rfk-jr-trump-political-interference/?utm_campaign=rss" target="_blank"&gt;STAT&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday that “the stakes are too high for us to sit back and watch. We cannot allow vaccine-preventable conditions, such as measles and whooping cough, to become regularly occurring outbreaks here in the US again, causing needless suffering and death.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vkn6xw0007356ogb5r42ni@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They added that, “given [Kennedy’s] history as the &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/authors/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" target="_blank"&gt;leader &lt;/a&gt;of an anti-vaccine organization, it is only prudent to anticipate ways the secretary could in the future exert his authority to reduce vaccine accessibility and discourage lifesaving immunizations.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9v7ud4z000a3b6ozv8y7nba@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The “initial feedback phase,” as Osterholm called it, will start this month and last until early August.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9v7ud4z000b3b6ozwek6ud5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We don’t know what’s this is going to look like at the end, but we’ll only find out by listening to all of these groups,” Osterholm said. “At the end of that process, hopefully we can all look at it and come to a similar conclusion, that this is what’s necessary or not necessary to protect the vaccine enterprise.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

Montana last week reported its first measles cases in 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2YRT7YUMZZGMRAZDUCQAGRJOKQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The majority of the infections have been reported in a West Texas outbreak that has led to the deaths of two children.

More than half the adults surveyed expressed uncertainty about whether to believe false assertions, such as that the measles vaccine is more dangerous than the disease — claims that Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/04/measles-outbreak-vitamin-a-concerns/" target="_blank"&gt;amplified&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="P6KCD4F7INF7XCTB4RYS2HDPIY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the decade before a measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, an estimated 3 million to 4 million people in the U.S. were infected each year, 400 to 500 people died, 48,000 were hospitalized and 1,000 suffered swelling of the brain, or encephalitis, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M2UYIN6WCNBTJBEB2T7SM2HFRI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But in 2000 the U.S. was finally able to declare measles “eliminated,” a term that means no continuous spread for more than a year. Cases and outbreaks still occur because of international travel, typically with an under-immunized U.S. traveler returning from a country where measles is endemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NFMUQLCK5FAXLEGRM2WA5LWWXA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For the new research, scientists used state vaccination, birth and death rates to find their results. They estimated current vaccination coverage for measles at 87.7 percent to 95.6 percent. To prevent measles outbreaks, 95 percent of a community must &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/03/24/measles-vaccine-booster-outbreak-states/" target="_blank"&gt;receive two doses &lt;/a&gt;of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BSBU6TKCPVC7HOAF3MFC5ZHOFE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Based on what scientists know about the epidemiology of measles, one of the most contagious diseases on Earth, they forecast how it would spread from one community to another and how quickly it could spread regularly at increased rates throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X4MBV7OM3ZF43FB6Y73WVTXXTA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study did not take into account the difference in vaccination rates within a state, the authors said. Nor did it account for changes in immunization rates when infections increased because of an outbreak, which occurred during the covid pandemic, Basit said. But even the most conservative estimates underscore the severe consequences if measles reestablishes itself in the U.S., the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7ESTN53RNNBKBLPV57PFPJWSVI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Measles outbreaks are surging globally, with Romania last year reporting the largest number of cases among 53 countries in Europe and Central Asia, according to the World Health Organization. Romania, with a population of about 19 million, had more than 30,000 cases in 2024, followed by Kazakhstan with about 28,000 cases. Romania’s recent measles surge is linked to declining vaccination rates, vaccine hesitancy, and disruptions in the health system during the pandemic, health experts have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KPCROIYM2NGITD7Q5QSHLOVDCA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the U.S., public health and infectious-disease experts have been talking for months about ways to combat false claims and misinformation about vaccines.

                        &lt;p&gt;Researchers have produced the most detailed image to date of a bacteriophage, or phage—a kind of virus that kills bacteria—that has allowed them to see for the first time the structural makeup of the part of the virus that directly attaches to its target Mycobacterium cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work could enable new therapies that use bioengineered phages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now you’ve got like a spec sheet for going in and designing phages so that they’ll bind to different kinds of cells,” says Graham Hatfull, a professor of biotechnology at the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s important because of what a bacteriophage, or phage for short, does after it binds to a bacterial cell: it pierces a hole in the cell membrane and injects its own DNA, turning the bacteria into a phage factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With many bacteria growing increasingly resistant to the antibiotics we use to kill them, phages are in some cases the only option to fight off bacterial infections. They are, however, picky assassins: A particular kind of phage will typically attack just one strain of bacteria. The ability to &lt;a href="https://www.futurity.org/bacteriophages-engineered-phages-1681432-2/"&gt;engineer a phage&lt;/a&gt; to seek out and destroy a specific bacteria could be a medical game-changer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.03.027"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phages have been evolving for billions of years. Despite all the variation this long history has given rise to, they almost all share similar components: a capsid, a tail tube, and a tail tip. Some parts are easier to image than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A phage capsid sits like a head atop the narrow tail tube. Researchers have for some time been able to capture high-resolution imagery a phage’s capsid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“First, it’s gigantic and easy to find,” says Krista Freeman, a research associate in Hatfull’s lab. It’s also composed of 60 symmetrical parts that can be averaged together to boost the signal. Imaging a phage using cryo-electron microscopy, one of the two imaging techniques used in this work, entails stitching together many images from different angles. Because of the part’s symmetry, relatively few images are needed to assemble enough information to piece together an entire capsid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the phage’s body is smaller and less symmetric by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So you have to be more careful,” Freeman says. “You have to find more particles, and do more hunting, and do more manual manipulations. It’s much less automated than getting the big structure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phages are made up of bundles of tangled, intertwined proteins that loop around and through the structure. They are less like a globe, with its information painted on the surface, and more like a sculpture of a flower—constructed out of Slinkies. In practice, this means piecing together a complete image takes tens of thousands of images of phages, all oriented in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this massive amount of data and a massive amount of computing power, Freeman was able to recreate the tail tube and, perhaps most tantalizingly, the tip of the tail, which binds to the bacteria. Currently, researchers do not know why a particular phage &lt;a href="https://www.futurity.org/bacteriophages-bacteria-2075422-2/"&gt;attacks&lt;/a&gt; a particular strain of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The tip of the tail, that’s the part that’s recognizing the bacteria cell,” Hatfull says. “We’re especially interested in it for this reason.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their high-definition images have allowed them to see structures that had previously only been resolved to a fuzzy grayscale that indicated the density of electrons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now you can show every molecular component in this thing,” Freeman says. “And it’s just breathtaking.” The new images also reveal structural information that researchers can explore to better understand the point of contact between a phage and its bacterial target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was astonishing to find out how complex the tail tip structure is,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The images are made dynamic thanks to work done by Raphael Park and his colleagues at Scripps Research, who used another kind of imaging, cryo-electron tomography, which images phages bound to the bacterial cell, highlighting the entire phage and where it attaches to the bacterial cell surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some images, the phage’s DNA is plainly visible inside the capsid; in others, it has made its way through the cell wall of the bacteria. Between these two steps, “there are some subtle differences,” in the structure of the phage, Hatfull says. These may point to the mechanism by which the DNA is triggered to leave the capsid or how it is transported through the tail tube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These are new insights,” Hatfull says. “There are a lot of questions remaining.” But Hatfull, Freeman, and researchers across the world can now start thinking seriously about beginning to engineer phages to recognize different bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Before, we wouldn’t have stood a chance. And now, doing this is going to become completely routine.”&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever had your mind blank out while in the middle of something, you’re far from alone. In research published this week, scientists are making the case that mind blanking is a genuine brain phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers from Belgium, France, and Australia conducted the study, a review of the existing data on mind blanking. They argue that blanking out should be seen and studied as its own state of consciousness, similar to but separate from things like having your mind wander.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The authors are all experts in consciousness research, and they were inspired to collaborate following a related &lt;a href="https://theassc.org/assc-25/"&gt;annual conference&lt;/a&gt; about three years ago. According to Athena Demertzi, director of the Physiology of Cognition lab at the University of Liège, the topic of mind-blanking isn’t exactly new to some scientists, particularly those studying meditation. But interest in it has also been steadily gathering steam among researchers studying cognition and sleep in recent years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Cognitive scientists have begun to recognize that individuals may also experience moments of blankness during wakefulness in their everyday life,” she told Gizmodo in an email. “Meanwhile, in the field of sleep and dreaming research, special categories of dreams, such as so-called ‘white dreams,’ where individuals recall having dreamt but cannot retrieve any content, have drawn increasing attention.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Demertzi and her colleagues reviewed data from around 80 research papers relevant to mind blanking, which included studies of theirs where they measured people’s brain activity during reported moments of the volunteers having nothing on their mind. And they came to a simple conclusion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Mind blanking is real, it’s not just a matter of forgetting or a failure to report. At times during the day, our stream of thoughts can simply stop, leaving us with the experience of thinking about nothing,” she said. “In our review, we show that mind blanking is not merely a subjective impression or an illusion. It corresponds to a distinct brain state, one that differs from those associated with the experience of specific mental content.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, mind blanking is linked to its own unique patterns of brain activity. In studies where people were asked to explicitly clear their mind of any thoughts, for instance, brain scans revealed reduced activity in certain regions like the supplementary motor cortex and hippocampus. Data from electroencephalograms (EEG) also indicate that parts of the brain might enter a sleep-like state when we blank out.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings, &lt;a href="https://info.cell.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3j3g04/VWTSBN5dMkWyW21PsDn3CCPPjW5SJqyG5vvQybKqQ-3qgyTW7Y8-PT6lZ3nbW2NNdc_60hM20W2b4LGj6Mns1TW3dmd2n98QVkDW7wR_g97wlt9JW7sl7jq9cdNSSN5dgs6b7_bThW1cYQ3L2ntVH0W9dmtl513PBZ5W2rXS_23k8XgVW5H0Krd3PGzMrW63M29y1ZZz97W35SRVN2-HR2xW54QqV95kmkvQVvfrCZ13tLBSW4Zjxtc1jvkLKW9lx5cy6s_-C7W3-sztB6HZXjSW3M6Hw56wF8l8W7TjCxw49RNV9N2LWNbWPhL1vN2TQ9mlmX0KHW7_RQVF6XJs0nW56GSCG1NP__zVvKZF544ZhHdW9krdTd8QSRltW8JvwWx4Cn5T3f4w_K4M04"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences, also suggest that people experience mind blanking between 5% and 20% of the time on average. And certain people seem more prone to blanking out than others, such as those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). That said, more research is needed to confirm these findings and to help answer plenty more open questions about the nature of mind blanking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For instance, we don’t yet know how long mind blanking episodes typically last, or whether there are different types. Could some instances be voluntary? Might mind blanking occur during high-performance states, such as flow?” Demertzi noted. “A deeper understanding of its neural mechanisms is also needed. Is mind blanking the result of a failure to generate mental content, or is it a failure of access (where content exists but doesn’t reach conscious awareness)?”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The authors ultimately hope their work can inspire others in the field to start paying more attention to blanking out. Meanwhile, I just want scientists to one day unravel where exactly in the brain all my intrusive thoughts about my cat come from.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;So, how much do Americans know about the bird flu?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/public-ignorance-apathy-toward-avian-flu-could-threaten-containment" target="_blank" title=""&gt;Not NEARLY enough&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can confirm some of this study from my own experiences on Instagram.  People think it is just an agricultural problem and would go away if we banned factory farming.  A lot of people think it is just in America. Or just started a couple of years ago. Many deny that it is at all serious.  And of course there is the oppositional defiant cohort that immediately say it's a hoax, a conspiracy, cooked up by Democrats, made up to sell vaccines, "you lied to us about Covid and we will never trust you again", on and on OMG. I don’t have the skills to detect if any of these are bots, but I fear the attitude is real in a significant number of actual people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/poll-finds-false-measles-claims-gaining-attention-amid-us-outbreaks" target="_blank" title=""&gt;False measles claims are getting a lot of attention.&lt;/a&gt;. Really, social media is a battlefield.  And our alleged HHS secretary is making matters much much worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In more news you really didn't want to hear, covid viruses remain infective in cadavers of infected mice for up to seven days, depending on temperature of storage. &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/mouse-study-suggests-prolonged-post-mortem-sars-cov-2-infectivity" target="_blank"&gt;Compared to only hours or two days for other viruses tested.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam reports a case of H5N1 &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/vietnam-reports-h5n1-avian-flu-case-encephalitis" target="_blank"&gt;manifesting as encephalitis&lt;/a&gt;.  Thus expanding the range of known tissues affected.  But given the neurological symptoms seen in birds and animals, really, this is not surprising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) today reported four more H5N1 avian flu detections in&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock" target="_blank"&gt;dairy cattle&lt;/a&gt;, three from Idaho and one from California, raising the national total since March 2024 to 1,025 detections from 17 states. Idaho has now reported 65 detections, making it the second most affected state behind California, which has reported 765. The Idaho Department of Agriculture says 25 herds are currently&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://agri.idaho.gov/animals/animal-disease/hpai-in-cattle/" target="_blank"&gt;quarantined&lt;/a&gt;, with 16 in Gooding County, 7 in Jerome County, and 2 in Twin Falls County. In poultry&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks" target="_blank"&gt;developments&lt;/a&gt;, APHIS over the past few days has reported one more H5N1 detection, which involves a live bird market in New York’s Queens County.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spring bird migrations are going to spike infections again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Cambridge–based DioSynVax and Singapore's ACM Biolabs have signed a deal to jointly develop a next-generation universal avian flu vaccine with the potential for mucosal delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mRNA vaccine targets all major clades of the H5 avian flu subtype and is scalable for rapid, global distribution, according to&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/04/22/3065588/0/en/Cambridge-s-DIOSynVax-and-Singapore-s-ACM-Biolabs-to-Advance-Pandemic-Ready-Universal-Bird-Flu-Vaccine-with-International-Support.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a press release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;from DioSynVax. Delivery via a nasal spray could help increase uptake of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be a game changer. Don't expect our government to get on board with it, but research will go ahead anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Testing of more than 36,000 deer has detected 243 cases of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://mdc.mo.gov/newsroom/mdc-reports-243-new-cases-cwd-found-during-past-year" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;chronic wasting disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;(CWD) in 35 Missouri counties—including 7 previously unaffected areas, the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) announced yesterday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long Covid is far more prevalent &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/studies-across-14-nations-show-25-30-rate-long-covid" target="_blank"&gt;than commonly thought.&lt;/a&gt; While many eventually recover, a very significant portion are affected long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Covid-19 &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/analysis-suggests-covid-19-diminishes-sperm-quality" target="_blank"&gt;diminishes sperm quality&lt;/a&gt;.  Bad news for all those conservative pro-natalists who also hate public health measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/chikungunya/chikungunya-outbreak-spreads-reunion-island" target="_blank"&gt;Chikungunya outbreak spreads on Reunion Island&lt;/a&gt; The last nine months have seen 35,000 cases. This is an insect-borne disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five people and 27 animals &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/tularemia/five-people-27-animals-tested-positive-tularemia-minnesota-last-year" target="_blank"&gt;Were diagnosed with tularemia&lt;/a&gt; in Minnesota last year.  While usually tick-borne, this disease can also be contracted by inhalation or handling diseased animals. Some of the patients reported mowing over small dead animals.  Maybe we should mask when mowing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Caused by the bacterium&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Francisella tularensis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, tularemia typically affects 200 to 300 people each year in the United States, most often in the central part of the country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

CIDRAP director Michael Osterholm said it’s intended to safeguard vaccine information, research or access in case the federal government doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our first, second and third choice is to have our federal government do its job,” Osterholm said. “But if that doesn’t happen, there has to be alternative voices out here that are based on the science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cited Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s track record of vaccine skepticism and &lt;a title="" class="apm-link default" data-testid="relativeLink" href="/story/2025/04/16/rfk-jr-mixed-message-about-measles-outbreaks-draws-criticism-from-health-officials"&gt;mixed messaging about the measles vaccine&lt;/a&gt; amid an outbreak, and a &lt;a class="apm-link null" data-testid="relativeLink" href="/story/2025/04/15/npr-cdc-acip-vaccines-meeting-rfk"&gt;postponed-and-rescheduled meeting&lt;/a&gt; of a federal vaccine advisory group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="donate-ask undefined"&gt;&lt;div class="donate-ask-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;MPR News helps you turn down the noise and build shared understanding. Turn up your support for this public resource and keep trusted journalism accessible to all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vaccine Integrity Project is starting with an eight-person steering committee. It’s meeting with a range of vaccine experts, including state health officials, vaccine manufacturers and academics. That group is co-chaired by former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg and health policy researcher Dr. Harvey Fineberg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This information-gathering phase will last until early August. Osterholm said speed is important, as federal vaccine policy could change quickly — but he wants to take time to plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We do not want to get ahead of our headlights,” Osterholm said. “We’re committed to hearing from all of those who have an important role in the vaccine enterprise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absent from that group are current members of federal health agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We will surely hear messaging from those who work with them, but there’s no one from CDC or FDA that’s involved with the steering committee, or the activities we have right now,” Osterholm said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osterholm said the project could take a lot of paths, depending on what the steering committee learns. It might establish its own vaccine evaluations, clinical guidelines and research recommendations. It could also review federal decisions and messaging around vaccines and publish its own information, if members see gaps in federal communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project is starting with a $240,000 grant from Alumbra, a foundation established by billionaire Christy Walton. Osterholm said the project will seek additional funding depending on its next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osterholm said it’s an approach he wouldn’t have imagined taking until the Trump administration took office. But he said experts want reassurance vaccine information will stay stable — reassurance they’re not getting from the federal government. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s hard to know what is going to happen the next day in public health,” Osterholm said. “We have to be open to whatever could come down the pike, and it’s going to be challenging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MPR News</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOZ2FQTS1SWUNTTUxBUVctWjVjNmc4VURRUHBtMXRVaHNkdU1hVlp2OVByTjlRcWh6eXpxWTA5MUFFZ3A4dUhQU21PTlVUdHFBQ05LNzY2eUg4dlZSQ3B3bmExV2xGTHp6X1lPQkdqSG9hdXNTNE00ejFtQ25WVXVuTU95emYxWnFSRXVUMHR4MVI2ZXBkaW8yUUxiUThGTHJ3cnBHQnktOHdnR00</guid></item><item><title>挥之不去的细菌碎片可能导致治疗后莱姆病症状-神经科学新闻 | Lingering Bacterial Debris May Drive Post-Treatment Lyme Symptoms - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE16ZVBQMlVvcW1yMzhZS0lHTW4wUHJISE1kVEhEcWR0WnVHcFVzR0FDdWFubUMzX3NIWV9wdVNpRl9nMzRqdnRGNWhVV1dCcTFobUxQMzNZMlBWd1UyckJsMDA5ai1DYVNnVFZPa0dKeV8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research suggests that lingering cell wall fragments from the Lyme disease bacterium, &lt;em&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt;, may be responsible for persistent symptoms long after antibiotic treatment. These fragments, made of a unique form of peptidoglycan, appear to accumulate in the liver and joints, triggering inflammation and immune responses even after the infection is gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mechanism resembles theories behind long COVID, where the immune system reacts to residual viral components. The findings could pave the way for targeted treatments and diagnostic tools that focus on inflammation rather than active infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistent Debris:&lt;/strong&gt; Lyme bacteria’s unique peptidoglycan can linger for months post-treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammatory Trigger:&lt;/strong&gt; These remnants may drive ongoing symptoms like joint pain and fatigue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Targets:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers are exploring monoclonal antibodies to neutralize the leftover molecules.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms that persist long after Lyme disease is treated are not uncommon — a 2022 study found that 14% of patients who were diagnosed and treated early with antibiotic therapy would still develop Post Treatment Lyme Disease (PTLD). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet doctors puzzle over the condition’s causes and how to help their patients through symptoms ranging from severe fatigue and cognitive challenges to body pain and arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Northwestern University scientists believe they know what causes the treated infection to mimic chronic illness: the body may be responding to remnants of the &lt;em&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt; (the bacteria that causes Lyme) cell wall, which breaks down during treatment yet lingers in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This matches one theory behind the underlying causes of long COVID-19 in that persisting viral molecules may encourage a strong, albeit unnecessary, immune response, said bacteriologist Brandon L. Jutras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lyme and long COVID-19 are clearly vastly different diseases, but it’s possible that they share a more general mechanism of inappropriate inflammation caused by remnants of a previous infection,” said Jutras, who led the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The maladaptive response is a product of an infection, but perhaps not necessarily an active one in all cases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peptidoglycan is a structural feature of virtually all bacterial cells and a common target of antibiotics, including penicillin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, to be published April 23 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, tracked the biodistribution of peptidoglycan from different bacteria, in real time, and found that all cell wall material is rapidly shed, but Lyme disease’s peptidoglycan persists for weeks to months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyme arthritis is one of the more common long-term impacts of exposure to Lyme. If a patient has a swollen knee, for instance, it is full of synovial fluid, a natural lubricant found in joints. Jutras said his team looked at the fluid in humans and found that pieces of the peptidoglycan were omnipresent weeks to months after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the context of Lyme arthritis, if you give patients anti-inflammatory, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, they get better,” Jutras said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some of these very same patients do not get better after oral and IV antibiotics, which implies there is something unique about how patients respond at a genetic level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jutras, who joined Northwestern faculty last summer, is an associate professor of microbiology-immunology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and a member of the Center for Human Immunobiology at Northwestern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has been studying Lyme disease for more than 15 years, beginning in graduate school, and was previously an associate professor at Virginia Tech University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Peptidoglycan is kind of like a structural skeleton in virtually all bacteria, acting as a big protective bag for the bacterium,” Jutras said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Penicillin and amoxicillin and dozens of other drugs target peptidoglycan synthesis because it’s a molecule that is specific to bacteria, it has similar structural features across the kingdom, and it’s essential.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyme’s peptidoglycan, however, is structurally unique, and this difference may be behind its persistence in humans. Instead of looking the same as with other bacteria, the Lyme peptidoglycan is fundamentally distinct, which is facilitated in part by sucking up sugars from its tick vector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon bacterial cell death — by antibiotics or the immune system — surviving molecules tend to relocate to the liver, which can’t process the modified peptidoglycan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without this modification, it seems likely that the peptidoglycan would clear right away, as in other infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The unusual chemical properties of Borrelia peptidoglycan promote persistence, but it’s the individual patient response to the molecule that likely impacts the overall clinical outcome,” Jutras said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some patients will have a more robust or stronger immune response, which could result in a worse disease outcome, while the immune system of others may largely ignore the molecule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, in essence, it’s not about whether the molecule is there or not, it’s more about how an individual responds to it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jutras hopes the groundbreaking findings will lead to development of more accurate tests, possibly for PTLD patients, and refined treatment options when antibiotics have failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To effectively stymie PTLD, instead of neutralizing an infection that may no longer exist, efforts are underway to neutralize the inflammatory molecule, including weaponizing monoclonal antibodies to target peptidoglycan for destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was supported by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (R21AI159800, R01AI173256, R01AI178711), the Steven &amp;amp; Alexandra Cohen Foundation, the Department of Defense (TB220039), the Global Lyme Alliance and the Bay Area Lyme Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurology and Lyme disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4b2722272a65392e322524272f380b2524393f233c2e383f2e3925652e2f3e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Win Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://northwestern.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Win Reynolds – Northwestern University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.adr2955" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The peptidoglycan of &lt;em&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt; can persist in discrete tissues and cause systemic responses consistent with chronic illness&lt;/a&gt;” by Brandon L.

One possible scenario involves the persistence of lingering antigen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have previously reported that patients with postinfectious Lyme arthritis often harbor the peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall of &lt;em&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt;, the Lyme disease agent, in the synovial fluid of their inflamed joints after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is not yet known how &lt;em&gt;B. burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt; PG persists, in what form, or if it may play a role in other postinfectious complications after Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a murine model, we developed a real-time in vivo system to track &lt;em&gt;B. burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt; PG as a function of cell wall chemistry and validated our findings using both molecular and cellular approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike typical bacterial PG, the unique chemical properties of polymeric &lt;em&gt;B. burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt; PG drive murine liver accumulation, where the cell wall material persists for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kupffer cells and hepatocytes phagocytose and retain &lt;em&gt;B. burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt; PG and, although liver occupancy coincides with minimal pathology, both organ-specific and secreted protein profiles produced under these conditions bear some similarities to reported proteins enriched in patients with chronic illness after acute infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, transcriptomic profiling indicated that &lt;em&gt;B. burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt; PG affects energy metabolism in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings provide mechanistic insights into how a pathogenic molecule can persist after agent clearance, potentially contributing to illness after infection.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 14:59:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE16ZVBQMlVvcW1yMzhZS0lHTW4wUHJISE1kVEhEcWR0WnVHcFVzR0FDdWFubUMzX3NIWV9wdVNpRl9nMzRqdnRGNWhVV1dCcTFobUxQMzNZMlBWd1UyckJsMDA5ai1DYVNnVFZPa0dKeV8</guid></item><item><title>它曾经在美国被消灭，现在，我们可能处于流行病的边缘。-石板 | It Was Once Eliminated From the U.S. Now, We Could Be on the Verge of an Epidemic. - Slate</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxObWhSSDUzSGU2am1ET3V3cFJKbVBlN1NoRVFYdmFrRXJONTlvR1EtMWxwcHJoQWNtVXBqeDZJUlNOVmtEaV9lWl84OUJzRmU2OGFMMlZOb1RyenVFbzE5X2wyOTY1eWYtUlpCckhPY241aHY3Q29CVkpUbE1rRVljMGt3SWxVUzdmR1RN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9uazbjf0012unm4pp2fgf3p@published"&gt;As of this week, there are at least &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/us-measles-total-climbs-800-cases-10-outbreaks"&gt;800 cases&lt;/a&gt; of measles in the U.S. across 25 states. There are 10 outbreaks—defined as three or more related cases—ranging from &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/health/measles-outbreak-map.html"&gt;New Mexico to New York&lt;/a&gt;. The largest outbreak, with 597 cases, started in Texas back in January. That’s where we had the first death of an unvaccinated child, in February. Another in April. Three in total. Before this year, there had been &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/06/measles-third-death-new-normal/"&gt;three deaths&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the years since the U.S. eliminated the disease (meaning that the disease was no longer continuously spreading) in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="50" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb4001j3b75czf1c06t@published"&gt;It’s concerning. The numbers are high, especially considering we’re less than halfway through the year. It’s very possible that &lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/third-measles-death"&gt;cases are being underreported&lt;/a&gt;. And they keep rising, with &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00786-w"&gt;no evidence&lt;/a&gt; that it will slow anytime soon. Which leads us to the million-dollar question: How bad could measles get this year?&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb5001k3b75whtg35o0@published"&gt;While it’s impossible to say for certain, experts say that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/opinion/measles-epidemic-texas.html"&gt;we’re standing on a precipice&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not out of the question that measles could rip through the entire country like wildfire. If each case is a spark, “the brush is burning right now,” says epidemiologist Michael Mina, who studies how infections and vaccines affect human health. Whether the burning brush will ignite the whole forest just depends on how long our strained firewalls can hold.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb5001l3b752lp8jc5q@published"&gt;Measles could continue breaking out in these bubbles (bad, but relatively confined to certain geographic areas). Or, if those bubbles grow large enough, they could converge and turn into a countrywide epidemic (very, very bad). To imagine &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; bad it could get, we can look to Europe, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/opinion/measles-epidemic-texas.html"&gt;Mina recently argued in a New York Times op-ed&lt;/a&gt;. In 2018, the continent saw more than 80,000 cases, tens of thousands of hospitalizations, and over 70 deaths, Mina says, including in countries that had achieved—and subsequently lost—elimination status. That’s possible here, too.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="176" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb5001m3b75xna6519c@published"&gt;If it feels like this is happening suddenly, it’s not. The U.S. has been moving toward this moment for decades, says Mina, long &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/13/upshot/vaccination-rates.html"&gt;before Robert F. Kennedy Jr. became health secretary&lt;/a&gt;. There are a mix of factors. For one, public health is often a victim of its own success: Once a disease has been wiped out for long enough, people forget how bad it was. In the days before the measles vaccine (aka the MMR vaccine), almost every kid got measles, says &lt;a href="https://shea-online.org/dr-david-weber-named-incoming-president-of-the-society-for-healthcare-epidemiology-of-america/"&gt;David Weber&lt;/a&gt;, president of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. Every year 3 million to 4 million people were infected; nearly 50,000 people &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;were hospitalized&lt;/a&gt;; hundreds died. The vaccine changed that. Those who survived the disease decades ago might protest, &lt;em&gt;Hey, I had the measles and just stayed home for a week, no biggie!&lt;/em&gt; People forget how many people died, says Weber. Not to mention, there are new parents today who never had to deal with the measles at all. For many, the idea of their kid getting the measles feels totally theoretical.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb5001n3b7545v6mxq4@published"&gt;The consequence of improved public health is that it becomes harder to convince people to go out of their way to vaccinate. Vaccination has always been hard to argue for; sticking a child with a needle full of some substance “goes against a parent’s natural evolutionary instincts,” says Mina. He doesn’t fault parents who worry about vaccination. Instead, he says, it’s the onus of public health officials to make sure parents are “exceedingly comfortable” to push back against those (totally reasonable!) instincts and make an informed decision to protect their child. That requires making sure parents have the information they need to evaluate the risks and benefits of a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb6001o3b75krhct2ix@published"&gt;Vaccine messaging by public health officials has left much to be desired, says Mina. Instead of acknowledging and addressing parents’ worries, they’ve taken a more paternalistic approach—i.e., “Just get the vaccine, it’ll be fine!” Then, early on in the pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention assured people that you couldn’t get COVID-19 after getting vaccinated, when you &lt;em&gt;could &lt;/em&gt;in fact still get COVID-19, albeit a much milder version. People felt like they’d been lied to, recalls &lt;a href="https://www.unbiasedscience.com/about-us"&gt;Jess Steier&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of the public health data science consulting firm (and &lt;a href="https://www.unbiasedscience.com/podcast"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;) Unbiased Science. “They burned the bridge of trust.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb6001p3b75pq7l21nn@published"&gt;Add all that to the fact that the MMR vaccine has been erroneously linked to autism (studies continue to show &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/the-evidence-on-vaccines-and-autism"&gt;no association between vaccines and autism&lt;/a&gt;). The seed was planted way back in 1998 thanks to a paper in the Lancet—a paper that was later found to be riddled with faulty data and has since been retracted. But that didn’t matter. It had already set off a movement, fanned by RFK Jr. and other &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/opinion/rfk-jr-is-a-vaccine-cynic.html"&gt;vaccine cynics&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, measles vaccination rates had been &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/13/upshot/vaccination-rates.html"&gt;dropping for many years&lt;/a&gt; before the pandemic came along.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="61" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb7001q3b75o8hbhq61@published"&gt;And we really need people to get the vaccine. Measles is incredibly contagious, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00786-w"&gt;far more so than COVID or flu&lt;/a&gt;. A single person with measles can walk through, say, a grocery store and continue to infect people for up to two hours after they’ve left the space, says Weber. Roughly &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/resource/frequently-asked-questions-about-measles/"&gt;90 percent&lt;/a&gt; of unvaccinated people exposed to measles will become infected.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb7001r3b75xnq2o75a@published"&gt;While measles’ mortality rate is relatively low compared with other diseases—about 0.2 percent of people infected with measles in the U.S. will die—the hospitalization rate is incredibly high: 20 percent, for people who haven’t been vaccinated. “This is not a benign disease,” says Weber. “How many infectious diseases do we have that 10 to 20 percent of the people end up in the hospital?” (It’s certainly not that high for flu, COVID, or other respiratory illnesses.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="158" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb7001s3b75jp4hxip7@published"&gt;All that being said, here’s the very &lt;em&gt;worst-&lt;/em&gt;case scenario for what could happen next with measles, according to Steier’s calculations. Given measles’ mortality rate of 0.2 percent, if the &lt;em&gt;entire &lt;/em&gt;unvaccinated U.S. population (23.5 million people) were exposed to measles, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIEM3qQuFTC/?img_index=3"&gt;nearly 50,000&lt;/a&gt; people could die. (This would likely occur over several years.) Given that 90 percent of exposed unvaccinated people become infected, and then 20 percent of &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; number face hospitalization, millions could end up in the hospital, and some with &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/measles/symptoms-causes/syc-20374857"&gt;potentially lifelong complications&lt;/a&gt;, including neurological damage, intellectual disabilities, and hearing loss. They also face the risk of something called &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/inside-immune-amnesia"&gt;immune amnesia&lt;/a&gt;, where the immune system “forgets” its immunity to other infectious diseases for a period of weeks to years. Even if they survive the measles, they could suffer or die from something else &lt;em&gt;because &lt;/em&gt;they got the measles. None of these calculations include the 22 million immunocompromised Americans who face heightened risk even if they were vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb7001t3b75nyt9nq44@published"&gt;It’s unclear what a nationwide outbreak would mean for the vaccinated population, says Steier. The MMR vaccine is &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/03/measles-outbreak-vaccine-booster-titers.html"&gt;incredibly effective&lt;/a&gt;—roughly 97 percent of people are protected with two shots—but it’s not been tested in an environment where there are thousands of cases. “We could see more breakthrough cases of measles, potentially,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb7001u3b75iv1ypjlv@published"&gt;It might also change how we live our lives. Like COVID days, we could see travel advisories or requirements to carry proof of immunity (which could cause procedural challenges, considering how many people are immune due to prior infection and thus have no vaccination records to prove their immunity, says Weber). This, of course, will depend on how the federal government responds.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="135" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb8001v3b75hz2r3mw5@published"&gt;Again, those are worst-case scenarios. How exactly measles will play out isn’t certain. But the way forward is clear, experts say: The only thing that can end the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine, full stop. That’s our firewall. In the current outbreaks, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;96 percent of people&lt;/a&gt; who have been infected are unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status. In the case of a measles infection, which can take days to develop symptoms, even a vaccination right before an individual gets exposed and infected can still make a difference in protecting them. That means “&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/essential-programme-on-immunization/implementation/catch-up-vaccination"&gt;catch-up&lt;/a&gt;” vaccination campaigns can be “very, very powerful” if an unvaccinated community gets hit hard with measles, says Mina. In other words, there are things that can be done late in the game, even if we cross into wildfire territory.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="118" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb8001w3b75cnk8nlfq@published"&gt;Alas, we continue to see mixed messaging about vaccines by the Department of Health and Human Services. In the past, kids dying of measles might have led to swift action by the CDC, such as widespread catch-up vaccination campaigns (some CDC employees &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-measles-cases-missed-texas-us-rfkjr-rcna201426"&gt;have been deployed&lt;/a&gt; to Texas, though resources are low after federal funding cuts last month). But even after the first child’s death in February, RFK Jr. continued to question the MMR vaccine and tout therapies, like vitamin A, that &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/03/measles-rfk-jr-vitamin-a-research-vaccination-nutrition-debunk.html"&gt;are not preventive measures&lt;/a&gt;. It wasn’t until early April that he &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/07/nx-s1-5354900/hhs-rfk-endorses-mmr-measles-vaccine-stoking-supporters-fury"&gt;finally endorsed the vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. And yet “the only way that we can prevent measles is MMR,” says Steier. “It’s bananas that we’re talking about anything else.”&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="106" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb8001x3b753sezczft@published"&gt;The good news is that, regardless of lagging federal efforts, individuals can opt to protect themselves &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/03/measles-outbreak-vaccine-booster-titers.html"&gt;with a vaccine&lt;/a&gt; that is incredibly effective. If you’re in an outbreak area or planning to travel, make sure you and your children are vaccinated, says Weber. Infants can receive an early vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/measles-vaccine-can-young-children-get-early-dose-mmr-shot-rcna198038"&gt;at 6 months&lt;/a&gt; (this would not be considered to be one of the standard doses, so they’d later still need the full two-shot regimen). As the threat has grown more imminent, “we are seeing an increased awareness amongst millions of people,” notes Mina. Hopefully many of them will update their risk-benefit analysis and get vaccinated, he says.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="121" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb8001y3b7581wzrae7@published"&gt;In the meantime, experts are keeping an eye out for red flags that we’re going the wrong way. If outbreak bubbles continue to grow—or worse, converge—we move closer toward a national epidemic, Mina says. Steier worries about a study that RFK Jr. has ordered to investigate the link between autism and vaccines, which will be headed by &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/dc-warns-major-measles-exposure-hhs-names-geier-study-autism-and-vaccines"&gt;David Geier&lt;/a&gt;, a man who &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/25/vaccine-skeptic-hhs-rfk-immunization-autism/"&gt;has been disciplined for practicing medicine without a license&lt;/a&gt;, has no advanced science degree, and has suggested for decades that vaccines cause autism. If the study claims to find a link (again, the existence of such a link has already been &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/03/vaccine-autism-rfk-jr-how-science-proves-vaccines-do-not-cause-autism/"&gt;investigated thoroughly and disproven&lt;/a&gt;), Steier anticipates that vaccination rates could plunge—the opposite of what needs to be happening.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="27" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb8001z3b75p1dbjwoo@published"&gt;Until vaccination rates improve, we’ll teeter on the edge with this disease. It’s not clear what will happen with measles next—but we’re not in a good &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;spot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The analysis, based on nearly two million people, showed that the more components of metabolic syndrome a person had, the greater their dementia risk, with women and those in their 40s being most vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study does not prove causation, it highlights the importance of managing cardiovascular and metabolic health during midlife. Preventive lifestyle changes could play a key role in reducing early cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s and Vascular Dementia:&lt;/strong&gt; Metabolic syndrome was linked to both major dementia subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;70% Risk Increase:&lt;/strong&gt; People with all five components of metabolic syndrome had a 70% higher risk of young-onset dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex and Age Disparity:&lt;/strong&gt; Women and individuals in their 40s faced the highest increased risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having a larger waistline, high blood pressure and other risk factors that make up metabolic syndrome is associated with an increased risk of young-onset dementia, according to a study published on April 23, 2025, online in &lt;em&gt;Neurology.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young-onset dementia is diagnosed before the age of 65. The study does not prove that metabolic syndrome causes young-onset dementia, it only shows an association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolic syndrome is defined as having excess belly fat plus two or more of the following risk factors: high blood pressure, high blood sugar, higher than normal triglycerides, which are a type of fat found in the blood, and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, or “good” cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While most dementia is diagnosed in older age, young-onset dementia occurs while a person is still working and perhaps raising a family,” said study author Minwoo Lee, MD, PhD, of Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital in Anyang, South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Our study found having metabolic syndrome in middle age is a risk factor for young-onset dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers reviewed national health insurance data in South Korea to identify nearly two million people between the ages of 40 and 60 who had a health check-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The check-up included measurements of waist circumference, blood pressure, blood sugar, triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Of all participants, 25% had metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over an average follow-up period of eight years, 8,921 people, or 0.45% of all participants, developed dementia. For those with metabolic syndrome, the incidence rate was 0.86 cases per 1,000 person-years, compared to 0.49 cases for those without metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Person-years represent both the number of people in the study and the amount of time each person spends in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for age, education and health factors such as level of physical activity, depression and stroke, researchers found metabolic syndrome was associated with a 24% higher risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When looking at specific types of dementia, it was associated with a 12% increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease and a 21% increased risk of vascular dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found female participants with metabolic syndrome had a 34% increased risk of dementia compared to male participants who had a 15% increased risk. People in their 40s had a greater risk than people in their 50s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found each component of metabolic syndrome was associated with an increased risk of dementia, which was cumulative. People with all five components had a 70% increased risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome, such as eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, maintaining a healthy weight, quitting smoking and reducing stress, may help reduce the risk of young-onset dementia,” said Lee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Future research that follows people over longer periods of time and uses brain scans to look for biomarkers of dementia is needed to confirm and expand upon our findings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A limitation of the study was that researchers did not review genetic risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by the Korean National Research Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this metabolism and dementia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d8b6bbb7b6aab9bc98b9b9b6f6bbb7b5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Natalie Conrad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aan.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AAN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Natalie Conrad – AAN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 13:56:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5YNk4wS3poV0c4d0tTQl9UZXZRQ1A2Y2k5cXViVjJhaHlNRHJfakFVZUh6X0FNLXRVMlNXOXFoWDBGTUEwUTlCbG11enBJOGx0RkZocUFtR1NUdXBCVXhpNUMtWFlPUVdLRjNaLVJLZUI</guid></item><item><title>密歇根州确认第9例麻疹病例，警告可能的接触部位- MLive.com | Michigan confirms 9th measles case, warns of possible exposure site - MLive.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DVZT743OGNFOXBXJE5HX64Q3QM"&gt;Ingham County has its second confirmed measles infection of the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HIHEJVD5ZBHF5KHJFFHEXGH3FY"&gt;A 1-year-old boy tested positive for the highly infectious disease Tuesday, April 22, after being exposed to the county’s first confirmed case earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="425SRSHKNJAQHC55TYGUMLQXWI"&gt;The boy experienced only mild symptoms, Ingham County health officials reported late Wednesday, April 23. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6N6MOZBHD5BBNI6QE2WHKEL65Y"&gt;&lt;b&gt;RELATED: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/2025/04/measles-trending-toward-worst-year-in-decades-warns-michigans-top-doc.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mlive.com/news/2025/04/measles-trending-toward-worst-year-in-decades-warns-michigans-top-doc.html"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Measles trending toward worst year in decades, warns Michigan’s top doc&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3TEBTIKQOVF5RJ7EIW5VSUDDAI"&gt;He was “age-appropriately vaccinated,” which likely means he got his first dose, recommended at 12 to 15 months, but not a second and final dose, recommended at 4 to 6 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GUVENI3FE5BYTAPSBL6DUBCB7U"&gt;The local health department said early isolation and limited exposure means the risk of infection for the public remains low.

These cultural meanings of affection, fun, and belonging made firearms easily accessible to the shooters—often without barriers at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many cases, parents purchased the firearms used or stored them in places their children could reach. The findings highlight that gun culture wasn’t just background context—it was a formative part of the shooters’ lives, shaping both their identities and their access to deadly weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural Bonding:&lt;/strong&gt; Many shooters described guns as symbols of love, friendship, or identity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy Access:&lt;/strong&gt; All shooters had unrestricted access to firearms—often supplied or enabled by family.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventive Focus:&lt;/strong&gt; The study urges focusing on reducing gun access and improving student belonging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PLOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new analysis of school shootings in the U.S. suggests that most shooters had a social background in which guns were a key leisure item, with attached meanings of bonding and affection, which also translated into easy access to firearms. Anne Nassauer of the University of Erfurt, Germany, presents these findings in the open-access journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt; on April 23, 2025.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For U.S. minors, guns are the leading cause of death. Some of these deaths occur in school shootings, where a current or former student fires at people at their school. Discussions of school shootings often cite the unique gun culture of the U.S. as a causative factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109074"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a child with a gun." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The findings suggest that research on how to prevent school shootings could focus on making guns more difficult for students to access and on finding ways to foster student belonging. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, few studies have methodically analyzed the role of gun culture in school shooters’ lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this gap, Nassauer analyzed all known U.S. school shootings across U.S. history (83 cases), some of which resulted in no deaths, some in a few deaths, and some in many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using data from court, police, and media records, she assembled a case file for each shooter and conducted cross-case and statistical comparisons to determine whether any patterns in gun culture emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis suggests that a distinct pocket of U.S. gun culture plays a key role in school shooters’ lives. Specifically, most shooters in the study came from a social background in which guns were key leisure items that were often important for family bonding time, often from a young age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some shooters described guns as being their “only friend” or the “love of [their] life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, all shooters in the study faced no difficulty in obtaining the guns they used in the school shootings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis suggests that this ease of access stemmed from the cultural meanings assigned to guns within the shooters’ social settings—namely, fun, bonding, and belonging—which translated into practices that made accessing guns easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, some parents had bought the guns their children then used for the school shooting, while others kept guns in easily accessible parts of their house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that research on how to prevent school shootings could focus on making guns more difficult for students to access and on finding ways to foster student belonging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author adds: “All school shooters in U.S. history had easy access to the firearms they used — even those who were very young or severely mentally ill. Many came from a gun culture where firearms are symbols of affection, bonding, and identity. The weapons were often freely accessible in the shooters’ homes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study shows school shooters don’t just use guns, but many grow up in worlds where guns are central to identity and belonging. Gun culture isn’t just a backdrop — it’s a formative part of many school shooters’ lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For many school shooters guns were what they called their ‘only friend’, or ‘the love of their life’. We can’t understand school shootings without understanding how gun culture shapes youth identities and gun access.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Guns don’t cause school shootings, but they make them possible — and often far too easy. There’s not a single school shooting in the US where a shooter had trouble getting a firearm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So we have to ask: Why do only those with easy gun access do it? Are other potential shooters deterred because they don’t have a gun within easy reach?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychology and gun violence research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c8a7a6adb8baadbbbb88b8a4a7bbe6a7baaf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hanna Abdallah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://plos.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PLOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Hanna Abdallah – PLOS&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0322195" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;“The only friend I had was my gun”: A mixed-methods study of gun culture in school shootings&lt;/a&gt;” by Anne Nassauer et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The only friend I had was my gun”: A mixed-methods study of gun culture in school shootings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firearms are the leading cause of death for minors in the United States and US gun culture is often discussed as a reason behind the prevalence of school shootings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, few studies systematically analyze if there is a connection between the two: Do school shooters show a distinct gun culture?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article studies gun culture in action in school shootings. It studies if school shooters show distinct meanings and practices around firearms prior to the shooting, as well as patterns in access to firearms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do so, I analyze a full sample of US school shootings. Relying on publicly available court, police, and media data, I combine qualitative in-depth analyses with cross-case comparisons and descriptive statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings suggest most school shooters come from a social setting in which firearms are a crucial leisure activity and hold meanings of affection, friendship, and bonding. These meanings translate into practices: all school shooters had easy access to the firearms they used for the shooting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings contribute to research on firearms and youth violence, public health, as well as the sociology of culture.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 13:34:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxNdEYxZFppWE85cXhpdk1ERlYzMkk5N3RaaUJiYUtxMmtnNjFjaEgyeHJCQ1djNU9hQUtFN0RoMjgzQWlzU3F1SVd0SHpxN09aZ2JoQ2VkNkphLVhOdy1QTkVxalJ2cndEeTJiMUtpeWx0Q3lQVUFWVUFoSW5INDVobg</guid></item><item><title>美国主要机场在感染世界上最具传染性疾病的患者通过后处于红色警戒状态-每日邮报 | Major US airport on red alert after patient infected with world's most infectious disease passes through - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials are sounding the alarm over a potential measles exposure at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An infected infant visited the airport's S Concourse with their family, potentially exposing others to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14618263/Michigan-state-measles-Ingham-County-baby-girl.html"&gt;the world's most infectious disease.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The person was at the airport - the largest in the Pacific North West, and one of the busiest in America - on April 17 between 4:50pm to 7:45pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The individual also passed through the customs and baggage claim areas before exiting through the south end of main terminal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They later visited Seattle Children's Emergency Department after developing symptoms on April 17, 18 and 20, and they were admitted on April 20.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes amid a major outbreak in West &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-bae8b720-10af-11f0-986b-856b684cc348" class=""&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, that has already sickened around 500 people and led to two deaths, marking the first fatalities in a decade in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nationwide, cases crossed a grim milestone last month surpassing the tally for the whole of 2024 and reaching their highest level since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials suspect the latest patient was exposed to measles while traveling abroad. They had not yet been vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials are warning anyone who may have been exposed to the virus to monitor themselves for symptoms for the next two weeks, particularly if they are unvaccinated, and contact their health provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anyone who develops symptoms is encouraged to immediately contact health services for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seattle–Tacoma International Airport is the primary international airport serving Seattle and its surrounding metropolitan area.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2024, it served 52.6 million passengers, ranking 11th in the US by passenger numbers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials say no infections linked to the infected individual have been reported to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on the matter, Seattle-based public health worker Elysia Gonzales said: 'Measles is highly contagious and if you don't have immunity, you can get it just by being in an area where a person with measles has been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We've seen an increase in measles cases around the world and in the US, so it's an important time to check your vaccination status and get vaccinated if you aren't protected.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cold-like symptoms, such as a fever, cough and a runny or blocked nose, are usually the first signal of measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles is one of the most infectious diseases in the world, with one person capable of spreading the virus to nine out of every 10 people they meet if those individuals are unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles is transmitted via breathing in infectious droplets that can remain suspended in the air for two hours after an infected patient passes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients develop a fever, cough, and runny nose, which then develops into a rash that starts at the hairline before spreading to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There's no cure for measles, with doctors instead using antibiotics to treat related infections and IV fluids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If unvaccinated, about one in five people who are infected are hospitalized while one in 20 children develop pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among unvaccinated children infected with measles, about one in 1,000 will develop encephalitis — or swelling of the brain. And nearly one to three out of every 1,000 will die from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vaccine is 97 percent effective at preventing an infection and is required for children attending school in some states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In terms of when to get vaccinated, Gonzales says: 'Children need two doses of MMR vaccine: the first dose at age 12-15 months, and the second dose at age 4-6 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Babies ages 6-11 months should get an early dose if traveling internationally. Adults should also check to see if they are immune to measles.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

ROACH: I thought you could help with a stubborn problem. I am a healthy and active 78-year-old woman who, I admit, likes to look younger than my age. The problem is my skin, especially on my hands and arms; I get these bruises that look unsightly and take a while to resolve. I hear it is from age-related thin skin. My friends of this generation also complain about these red spots or bruises. They don’t hurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6Q75IUAN75FVROIP2ET3TZKZM4"&gt;Could I take vitamin K or increase my platelets so as to limit their happening? I’ve read not to take aspirin or any pain reliever. Is there any medicine to take to help my blood coagulate better or make my skin thicker? -- S.M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BJ4FHKD5CJHPJPLGWLOMEBGH5U"&gt;ANSWER: This common problem is called solar purpura, and it is largely the sun causing the damage to the skin, thinning it with age. Avoiding the sun and moisturizing your skin diligently can reduce the risk of this happening. Once it’s happened, these measures are still important for preventing it from getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="X3HW7MPFJRBPFPNL2VPIQOXDOU"&gt;You should still avoid the sun and moisturize to prevent the condition from worsening. One study showed that bioflavinoid supplements helped reduce new bruises. These aren’t particularly expensive, but you can also get them through food, specifically citrus and other fruits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WM3GGPWBEREF3NIROJXWGJMXQM"&gt;Vitamin K deficiency causes clotting problems, but taking more vitamin K doesn’t help. Aspirin does reduce the effectiveness of platelets, but if you are prescribed it (for blockages in the heart, for example), you should definitely keep taking it. Occasional ibuprofen has little effect on platelets, and acetaminophen (Tylenol) has none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRJI3BUMM5EXNB2XTTLEAU57NY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: For years, I have been plagued by a chronic nasal drip. It’s usually most present in the mornings, though it seems to be intermittent during the day. I frequently have to wipe or blow my nose. I thought it might be due to allergies, so I have been taking a Zyrtec tablet every morning. But it doesn’t seem to have any effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" class="middleParagraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="55MVLIRNOVBQZK3WX6MPAOF73I"&gt;I talked with my primary care physician about this, but he didn’t have any recommendations. I don’t know what is going on or how to stop this. Do you have any recommendations? -- R.M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ERNB4OIKOZBQ3ESMDTVAMJJNH4"&gt;ANSWER: An antihistamine like Zyrtec is a reasonable thing to try as allergic rhinitis often responds to antihistamines. (We just love our Latin and Greek names, and “rhinitis” comes from the Greek roots for “inflammation of the nose.”) Since an antihistamine didn’t work, it seems likely that you might have nonallergic rhinitis, and a nasal spray like ipratropium is usually effective for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VFTE6EDO2FAELN3PQKG2L5HYEM"&gt;I also recommend azelastine nasal spray, which is now available over the counter as “Astepro.” There are some steps you can do to help your environmental risk, such as reducing dust and avoiding excess dryness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IKQRSIWKVZEA3AFWRSDDXZMCBA"&gt;I warn people against the habitual use of nasal decongestants like Afrin, which should only be used for a day or two -- never more than three. Once the body gets used to it, nasal congestion will worsen every time a person tries to go without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TPKIIVFQUJHIXATSWXKOI2IM7M"&gt;If the nasal spray doesn’t do the job, I’d recommend an evaluation by an expert, such as an otorhinolaryngologist, who may need to look for nasal polyps, laryngopharyngeal reflux, and other less-common causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HTULFGZG4NDGHFQWUJU7C2XQ4M"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

The vaccine showed effectiveness in mice and non-human primates, prompting researchers to pursue human clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It targets a specific region of the tau protein, pT181, linked to Alzheimer’s-related brain damage and cognitive decline. If successful in humans, this approach could complement or even surpass current therapies that only modestly impact disease progression by targeting amyloid beta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tau-Targeting Vaccine:&lt;/strong&gt; Generates antibodies against pT181, a hallmark of Alzheimer’s pathology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Immune Response:&lt;/strong&gt; Proven effective in mice and macaques, with long-lasting immunity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Trials Ahead:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers are preparing for Phase 1 human trials pending funding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of New Mexico&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;University of New Mexico Health Sciences researchers hope to launch human clinical trials in their quest for a vaccine to prevent the buildup of pathological tau – a protein in the brain associated with Alzheimer’s dementia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new paper published in &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s and Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/em&gt;, a team led by Kiran Bhaskar, PhD, professor in the Department of Molecular Genetics &amp;amp; Microbiology in the UNM School of Medicine, found that the experimental vaccine generated a robust immune response in both mice and non-human primates, building on earlier research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109070"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-vaccine-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The vaccine elicited a strong immune response in two other strains of mice bred to develop tau-related disease – one of which had a human tau gene inserted in its genome. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because we’ve shown efficacy in the non-human primate, I think that is suggesting to us it’s much closer to a clinical trial,” Bhaskar said, adding that he and his colleagues are seeking funding from venture capitalists and the Alzheimer’s Association to launch a Phase 1 trial in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tau is a naturally occurring protein that helps stabilize neurons, but when it undergoes a process called phosphorylation, it deforms and is ejected from neurons into the extracellular space, creating the tangles that are characteristic of Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several new FDA-approved treatments for drugs that reduce levels of amyloid beta, another protein implicated in Alzheimer’s pathology, but they have only a modest effect on the progression of the disease, leading many to wonder whether targeting tau might be a better bet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The active immunotherapy developed at UNM generates antibodies that bind to pT181, a region of the altered tau protein that has been identified as an Alzheimer’s biomarker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2019 paper published in &lt;em&gt;NPJ Vaccines&lt;/em&gt;, Bhaskar and his colleagues reported that when the vaccine was given to mice bred to express pathological tau they generated antibodies, reduced the extent of the tangles in key brain structures and improved their performance on tests to gauge their cognitive disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new paper expands on those findings. The vaccine elicited a strong immune response in two other strains of mice bred to develop tau-related disease – one of which had a human tau gene inserted in its genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a collaboration with the University of California, Davis, and the California National Primate Research Center  the vaccine was also administered to macaques, primates whose immune systems and brains are closer to humans. They also showed a strong and durable immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also tested antibodies in the serum from the immunized monkeys on samples of blood plasma drawn from people with mild cognitive impairment, often a precursor to full-blown Alzheimer’s dementia, as well as the sera in brain tissue from people who had died from Alzheimer’s, and found that they bound to the human version of the tau protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine was developed using a virus-like particle (VLP) platform developed by Bryce Chackerian and David Peabody, Bhaskar’s colleagues in Molecular Genetics &amp;amp; Microbiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VLPs are essentially viruses whose DNA has been removed, rendering them harmless. Snippets of proteins – in this case pT181 – can be attached to their surface, rendering them visible to immune cells on the lookout for invaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VLP-based vaccines have been shown to create durable immunity, with one primary inoculation and two booster shots, Bhaskar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They don’t require adjuvants – substances (such as aluminum) administered with a vaccine to enhance the immune response. And, they have been shown to be safe in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicole Maphis, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in the UNM Department of Neurosciences, was the first author on both of the vaccine papers. She said the collaboration with UC Davis was critical for validating the vaccine’s efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was important because it extends our work in an animal model that is more similar to humans,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mice don’t have a human immune response, but these non-human primates, their immune response is much more similar to humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#85e6ebe2e4f7e6ece4c5f6e4e9f0e1abf0ebe8abe0e1f0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chris Ramirez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://unm.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Chris Ramirez – University of New Mexico&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/alz.70101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Targeting of phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 by a Qβ virus-like particle vaccine is safe, highly immunogenic, and reduces disease severity in mice and rhesus macaques&lt;/a&gt;” by Kiran Bhaskar et al. &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeting of phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 by a Qβ virus-like particle vaccine is safe, highly immunogenic, and reduces disease severity in mice and rhesus macaques&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70101-sec-0010-title"&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pathological accumulation of tau (pTau) contributes to various tauopathies, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and correlates with cognitive decline. A rapid surge in tau-targeted approaches via anti-sense oligonucleotides, active/passive immunotherapies suggests that targeting p-Tau is a viable strategy against tauopathies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70101-sec-0020-title"&gt;METHOD&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We describe a multi-species validation of our previously described Qß virus-like particle (VLP)–based vaccine technology targeting phosphorylated tau on threonine 181 (pT181-Qß).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70101-sec-0030-title"&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two vaccine doses of pT181-Qß, without any adjuvants, elicited robust antibody responses in two different mouse models of tauopathy (PS19 and hTau) and rhesus macaques. In mouse models, vaccination reduced AT180+ hyperphosphorylated, Sarkosyl insoluble, Gallyas silver positive tau, inflammasomes/neuroinflammation, and improved recognition memory and motor function without inducing adverse T-cell activation. Anti-pT181 antibodies are reactive to pTau in human AD brains, engage pT181+ tau in human brain lysates, and are central nervous system bioavailable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70101-sec-0040-title"&gt;DISCUSSION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest the translational utility of pT181-Qß against tauopathies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The company behind the product, Contraline, says the approach offers a reversible alternative to condoms and vasectomies, with the hydrogel designed to break down in the body after a set period of time, restoring fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Contraline has released details of its phase 1 clinical trial, revealing Adam can successfully block the release of sperm for 24 months, with no sperm detected in the semen of the two participants who have so far reached this time point in the trial. In addition, it said no serious adverse events had been recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This is really exciting because our goal since day one has been to create a two-year-long male contraceptive – that is what the demand is for: a two-year-long, temporary or reversible male birth control. And we have the first data to show that that’s possible,” said Kevin Eisenfrats, the founder and chief executive of Contraline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Eisenfrats said the 25 participants in the clinical trial were enrolled at different points in time, with more results expected to follow. “It’s great proof of concept,” he added..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Eisenfrats said the implant was inserted in a minimally invasive procedure that took about 10 minutes and used local anaesthetic, meaning the patient remained awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Adam is not the first male contraceptive in development that acts by blocking the sperm ducts (vas deferens), although Eisenfrats said some other implants had used materials that did not break down in the body. He said there was little data to show fertility was restored after these were removed, while there were also concerns such implants could cause scarring of the vas deferens and lead to permanent sterilisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The results from the Adam clinical trial have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal and do not include data on the reversibility of the implant. However, Eisenfrats said the hydrogel had a predictable lifespan and had been shown to break down over time in animal trials, with work using lower doses in men revealing a shorter period of efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The way to think about this is sort of like the IUD [intrauterine device] for men,” Eisenfrats said, adding that after a two-year period men could decide whether to get another implant. The team is working on a procedure to enable “on-demand reversal”.

Researchers found that boys born to mothers who experienced early-life adversity gained significantly more weight per day than average, despite being full-term, healthy, and mostly breastfed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest early metabolic alterations linked to intergenerational trauma, with the male placenta being more vulnerable to maternal stress-related factors like inflammation and cortisol. While the changes raise concerns about long-term health risks, researchers emphasize that these effects are modifiable with early monitoring and intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex-Specific Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Only male infants showed excessive early weight gain linked to maternal trauma.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metabolic Shift:&lt;/strong&gt; Boys gained up to 78g/day—well above the WHO’s recommended 30g/day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Placental Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Male placentas are more sensitive to inflammatory signals from maternal stress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;FAPESP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adverse situations experienced by the mother during childhood – such as neglect or physical, psychological or sexual violence – can trigger excessive weight gain in male children as early as the first two months of life. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was shown in a study that followed 352 pairs of newborns and their mothers in the cities of Guarulhos and São Paulo, Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109066"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a mom and baby." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Another important issue is that the placenta of male fetuses tends to be more susceptible to fluctuations in substances and metabolites present in the maternal bloodstream compared to female placentas. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyses indicated the occurrence of very early metabolic alterations in babies that not only led to weight gain above that expected for their age but also have the potential to increase the future risk of developing obesity and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first article resulting from a Thematic Project supported by FAPESP and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States. Using a database of 580 vulnerable pregnant women, the group is studying intergenerational trauma, i.e., negative effects that can be passed on to future generations, even if the offspring have not lived through such experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducted by researchers from Columbia and Duke Universities, both in the United States, and the School of Medicine of the Federal University of São Paulo (EPM-UNIFESP) in Brazil, the study focuses on issues related to mother-baby interaction, development, and mental and physical health.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We observed that although the babies were born weighing within the expected parameters, in the first few days of life they showed altered weight gain, far above what’s recommended as ideal by the World Health Organization [&lt;em&gt;WHO&lt;/em&gt;],” says Andrea Parolin Jackowski, professor at UNIFESP and coordinator of the project in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the WHO, the ideal weight gain in the first stage of life is up to 30 grams per day. However, the male babies in the study had an average weight gain of 35 grams per day – with some gaining up to 78 grams per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The babies who took part in the study were born full-term, healthy and within the ideal weight range. All of the pregnancies we followed were low-risk, but our data showed that every adversity the mother experienced during childhood increased the babies’ weight gain by 1.8 grams per day. And this was limited to males,” the researcher reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Jackowski, there are many factors that can influence a baby’s weight in early life, and maternal childhood trauma appears to be one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, the analysis took care to control for so-called confounders – variables related to the mothers’ stress levels that could influence the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some examples include lifetime trauma experiences (the effects of which are cumulative) and current trauma, as well as education level and socioeconomic status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s also important to note that 70% of the babies who took part in the study were exclusively breastfed. The other 30% were on mixed feeding [&lt;em&gt;a combination of breast milk and formula&lt;/em&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This means that they weren’t eating filled cookies or other foods that could actually change their weight. Therefore, the results suggest the occurrence of an early metabolic alteration in these babies,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why only boys?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the researcher, maternal trauma during childhood only had an impact on the weight of male babies because of physiological variations in the placenta associated with the sex of the fetus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The placenta is a temporary organ composed of maternal and fetal tissue that shows structural differences and differences in the regulation and expression of steroids and proteins depending on the sex of the baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Male fetuses develop strategies to maintain constant growth in the face of an adverse intrauterine environment, leading to a greater risk of prematurity and fetal death,” explains the researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, she adds, childhood adversity is known to increase the risk of depression and anxiety during pregnancy, which can lead to increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cortisol in the intrauterine environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “It appears that the placenta of female fetuses adapts to protect them, slowing down the growth rate without restricting intrauterine growth [&lt;em&gt;i.e., the size of the baby is within the expected range at the end of pregnancy&lt;/em&gt;] and allowing for a higher survival rate,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important issue is that the placenta of male fetuses tends to be more susceptible to fluctuations in substances and metabolites present in the maternal bloodstream compared to female placentas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a result, in these cases of trauma, it can become more permeable, causing the male fetus to be more exposed to inflammatory factors resulting from high levels of stress, such as cortisol and interleukins, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work now published is the first to identify intergenerational trauma as a trigger for physical changes at such an early age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s already known that adverse events in the mother’s childhood can trigger psychological and developmental problems, but our study is pioneering in showing that they can affect physical problems, such as weight gain, as early as the first two months of life,” says Jackowski.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the research team, which includes Vinicius O. Santana and FAPESP postdoctoral fellow Aline C. Ramos, will follow the weight development of the children of mothers who suffered adversity in childhood until they are 24 months old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to follow them for longer because we want to investigate the impact of the introduction of food, which usually occurs at 6 months of age,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the researchers explain, the research suggests that metabolic changes can be modified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not a matter of determinism. We need to monitor how the metabolism and inflammatory factors behave in these babies over a longer period of time to understand how to modulate this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to know that all of this is modifiable, and we’re now going to look at how we can intervene,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#056d77606c6b607771456364756076752b6777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Heloisa Reinert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://fapesp.br" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FAPESP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Heloisa Reinert – FAPESP&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-87078-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sex-specific association between maternal childhood adversities and offspring’s weight gain in a Brazilian cohort&lt;/a&gt;” by Andrea Parolin Jackowski et al. &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex-specific association between maternal childhood adversities and offspring’s weight gain in a Brazilian cohort&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maternal adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are linked to negative health and developmental outcomes in offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, whether maternal ACEs influence infant weight gain in the first months of life, and if this effect differs by infant sex, remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study included 352 full-term newborns from low-risk pregnancies and their mothers in low-income settings in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropometric data (weight, length, head circumference) and other information (feeding type, offspring sex, family income) were collected at delivery (W0), discharge (W1), and up to 8 weeks postpartum (W2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACEs were assessed using the CDC-Kaiser Questionnaire, and weight gain was calculated as the difference between W2 and W1, divided by the number of days between measurements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The association between maternal ACEs and offspring weight gain was positive only in male offspring (unstandardized coefficient (male) = 1.82, SE = 0.438, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001); for each 1-point increase in the ACEs score (e.g., from 0 to 1), weight gain increased by 1.8 g/day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings indicate that maternal ACEs are associated with increased weight gain in male infants during the first two months of life, potentially increasing the risk of future obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research is required to investigate the underlying biological mechanisms and their neurodevelopmental implications.&lt;/p&gt;

Life-threatening reactions called anaphylaxis occur when the immune system mistakenly overreacts, affecting a patient's ability to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However building tolerance is known to help calm and prevent this extreme reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The trial, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journalallergy.com/"&gt;Allergy&lt;/a&gt;, shows adults with serious allergies can increase the amount of peanut they can tolerate by 100 times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants for whom the strategy works should eat four peanuts every morning to keep the allergy at bay, as recommended by doctors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chief Investigator Professor Stephen Till, Professor of Allergy at King’s College London, said: 'Constant fear of life-threatening reactions place a huge burden on people with peanut allergy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The only way to manage a peanut allergy is strict avoidance and treatment of allergic reactions, including with adrenaline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Although peanut immunotherapy is known to be effective in children, this trial provides preliminary evidence that adults can also be desensitised and that this improves quality of life.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The trial, published in the journal Allergy , shows adults with serious allergies can increase the amount of peanut they can tolerate by 100 times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he said larger studies were needed to confirm findings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead author, Hannah Hunter a specialist Allergy Dietitian from Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust said: 'Living with peanut allergy is a huge burden due to the need for constant vigilance and the risk of accidental exposures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Everyday situations such as eating in restaurants and social events are anxiety provoking and our patients tell us that the condition also affects travel choices and career options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We found that quality of life significantly improved after oral immunotherapy and fear of food also decreased.

By analyzing data from over 17,000 individuals, researchers found that immune resilience, particularly involving the TCF7 gene, protects against chronic inflammation, immunosenescence, and cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals in midlife with high immune resilience had a 69% lower mortality rate and a biological age advantage of up to 15 years. These findings spotlight immune resilience as a central factor in sustaining health and suggest that midlife is the optimal window for interventions to extend healthspan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protective Power:&lt;/strong&gt; Immune resilience reduces midlife mortality risk by 69%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longevity Marker:&lt;/strong&gt; TCF7 gene helps preserve immune cell regeneration and function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15-Year Gap:&lt;/strong&gt; Poor immune resilience at 40 equals the mortality risk of someone aged 55.5.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Wiley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A study published in &lt;em&gt;Aging Cell &lt;/em&gt;has identified immune resilience as a key driver of salutogenesis—the active process of promoting health and well-being.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By analyzing data from 17,500 individuals across various life stages, investigators uncovered the importance of immune resilience involving &lt;em&gt;TCF7&lt;/em&gt;, a gene essential for maintaining immune cell regenerative potential, in fostering healthy aging and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109057"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/immune-longevity-aging-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/immune-longevity-aging-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/immune-longevity-aging-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/immune-longevity-aging-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/immune-longevity-aging-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/immune-longevity-aging-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/immune-longevity-aging-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/immune-longevity-aging-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows two older ladies and DNA." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/immune-longevity-aging-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/immune-longevity-aging-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/immune-longevity-aging-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/immune-longevity-aging-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/immune-longevity-aging-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/immune-longevity-aging-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/immune-longevity-aging-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Maintaining optimal immune resilience preserves youthful immune profiles at any age; enhances vaccine responses; and significantly reduces the burden of cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and severe infections. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research indicates that immune resilience counters three major factors of aging and mortality: chronic inflammation, immune system decline (immunosenescence), and cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This protective mechanism mitigates biological aging processes and confers survival advantages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, at age 40, individuals with poor immune resilience face a 9.7-fold higher mortality risk—a risk equivalent to that of 55.5-year-olds with optimal immune resilience, resulting in a 15.5-year survival gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining optimal immune resilience preserves youthful immune profiles at any age; enhances vaccine responses; and significantly reduces the burden of cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and severe infections.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Midlife (ages 40–70) emerges as a pivotal window for longevity, with immune resilience reducing mortality by 69% during this period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, after age 70, mortality rates converge between resilient and non-resilient groups, suggesting biological limits on lifespan extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings underscore the importance of early midlife interventions to boost immune resilience to maximize healthspan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While most aging research focuses on disease mechanisms and the biology of aging, our work highlights how immune resilience sustains salutogenesis—actively promoting health,” said senior author Sunil K. Ahuja, MD, of UT Health San Antonio and the South Texas Veterans Health Care System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This opens new avenues for strategies to enhance lifelong wellness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this longevity and aging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#600e051713120f0f0d2017090c05194e030f0d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sara Henning-Stout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wiley.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Wiley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Sara Henning-Stout – Wiley&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/acel.70063" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The 15-Year Survival Advantage: Immune Resilience as a Salutogenic Force in Healthy Aging&lt;/a&gt;” by Sunil K.

After age 70, mortality rates converge between resilient and non-resilient groups, reflecting biological limits on longevity extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TNFα-blockers restore salutogenesis pathways, indicating IR delays aging-related processes rather than altering aging rates. By reframing aging as a salutogenic-pathogenic balance, we establish &lt;em&gt;TCF7&lt;/em&gt;-centered IR as central to healthy longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Targeted midlife interventions to enhance IR offer actionable strategies to maximize healthspan before biological constraints limit benefits.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 12:13:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE5Udkloamc1U0dxQk1zd1pXRHdYX2JYelY1ODlDMlFEWHYzd1RXSFZHdzkzdUcweFBqRFR5bFowQ0xON0hHa185OVk0Q1NvSWxaeEdySWs1RkhCMGNjSC1EOUZXbFhVamJwY1d3Z3lwVDJpRUVRMHRjaQ</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，常见药物与认知能力的微妙变化有关- PsyPost | Common medications linked to subtle shifts in cognitive performance, study finds - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxPZ3hKMkVmdGVaU3FLbWk2TFJmTEc1ZU1SYnJfcnJpNFItSUJRbWhRbE1hcXJfTFdXQkZSZ1VRTk1PYld1c3oweFVjbHlBQllyNjkzWjFmbGp2aXRBZVRsc1VuTFl3U1dmczdpSEJjZzlrYk1YQUctUkF1SEFjSUJoMUliZFFtbzJlRkEyZnl5UkRWYjFUQVRKQWN2UHd0dF9jbGpWLW81WQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large-scale study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.70200" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Brain and Behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has found that some widely used medications may have subtle but meaningful associations with cognitive performance—both positive and negative—when considered across entire populations. By analyzing data from more than half a million individuals in the United Kingdom and validating the findings in two additional cohorts, researchers developed a “cognitive footprint” framework to estimate how different medications might influence mental performance on a broad scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was designed in response to growing awareness that many medications can affect thinking and memory, even if cognitive function is not the drug’s intended target. Although these effects are often small, the widespread use of certain medications means that even slight impairments or improvements could add up to significant effects at the societal level. This has implications not only for public health but also for how drug trials and prescriptions are evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have been exploring the concept of a cognitive footprint of individual-level and societal-level events and interventions. This is similar to the concept of a carbon footprint, which can be positive or negative and has a cumulative effect over time,” said study author Martin Rossor, a professor at the UCL Institute of Neurology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Drug side effects are very common—particularly cognitive ones—but often not sufficiently recognized, especially for medications that do not specifically target the central nervous system. Even small effects may have significant societal impact if a medication is taken for a long time or by many people. So this was an opportunity to look at the positive and negative cognitive footprints of medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this, the researchers drew on three long-running population studies: the UK Biobank, which includes over 500,000 participants aged 37 to 73; the EPIC Norfolk study, with over 8,000 participants who completed cognitive testing; and the Caerphilly Prospective Study, a smaller cohort of nearly 3,000 older men. Each of these studies collected detailed data on participants’ medication use, health history, and cognitive performance. However, the cognitive tests used differed across studies, requiring sophisticated statistical methods to align the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK Biobank, researchers used a statistical approach called principal component analysis to create a summary measure of overall cognitive ability from various individual tests, including reaction time, fluid intelligence, and memory tasks. They then applied Bayesian regression models to estimate the relationship between regular use of different medications and cognitive performance, accounting for a wide range of other factors such as age, income, physical health, mood, and education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that many medications had measurable associations with cognition, although the size of these effects was generally small. Among those most negatively associated were medications targeting the central nervous system, including some antiepileptics and antidepressants. For example, valproic acid, a commonly prescribed drug for seizure disorders, had one of the largest negative associations with cognitive speed. Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, was also linked to reduced performance across several cognitive measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cognitive side effects of medications are frequent and often overlooked,” Rossor told PsyPost. “Interventional trials and post-market surveillance should include structured assessments of cognition routinely, whether or not the intervention is plausibly neurotropic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, some medications showed positive associations. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, were linked to better scores on various cognitive tasks. Glucosamine, a supplement often used for joint pain, consistently showed small positive associations across all outcomes. Omega-3 fatty acids, known for their potential brain benefits, were also positively associated with several cognitive measures, particularly in the EPIC Norfolk and Caerphilly cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, emerged as a drug of particular interest. It was one of the most frequently used medications and consistently showed small but negative associations with cognitive performance across the three cohorts. Because of its widespread use, this resulted in a relatively large “negative cognitive footprint” when scaled up to the population level. This means that, even though the individual impact may be minor, the overall effect across millions of users could be meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we anticipated negative effects, we were surprised that glucosamine and ibuprofen had a significant positive cognitive footprint,” Rossor said. “It’s also noteworthy that paracetamol and ibuprofen, which are often taken for similar purposes, had among the worst and best cognitive footprints observed in the study, respectively, across several cognitive domains.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To estimate the broader implications, the researchers extrapolated their findings to the general UK population aged 40 to 70. They used standardized effect sizes (Z-scores) to compare the cognitive impact of medications with other known factors, such as air pollution and aging. For instance, the positive footprint of ibuprofen on overall cognitive ability was roughly equivalent to reducing the average age of the population by two months or lowering nitrogen dioxide pollution by one microgram per cubic meter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cognitive effects were most consistent for measures of processing speed and attention, suggesting that these functions may be especially sensitive to drug-related changes. However, not all cognitive domains were equally affected, and the impact of some medications varied across different studies. For example, glucosamine showed a positive effect in the UK Biobank and EPIC Norfolk cohorts but not in the older Caerphilly sample, where it was used less frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors caution that their findings are observational and do not prove that medications directly cause changes in cognitive performance. Despite using advanced statistical models to control for a wide range of potential confounding factors, such as pain or general health, it is still possible that unmeasured variables or reverse causation played a role. People who take certain medications may differ in important ways from those who do not, and some participants may have had early signs of cognitive decline before starting medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The major caveat is that association does not prove causation,” Rossor noted. “The cross-sectional nature of the study—since there was not enough data for exploring longitudinal effects—means that the relationship between medication and cognition may be difficult to interpret.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we tried to isolate the effects of medication by modeling as many other factors as possible—for example, the effects of pain on cognition in individuals taking paracetamol—these influences can never be entirely ruled out. We can only provide an upper bound of the potential effect at the population level of a medication’s cognitive footprint.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study introduces a useful new tool—the cognitive footprint—for evaluating the broader effects of medications on mental performance. By incorporating both effect size and population prevalence, this approach highlights the importance of considering cognition in drug development, prescribing practices, and public health policy. It also underscores the need for more comprehensive research on the unintended cognitive effects of medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements that are widely used but rarely studied in this context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research may benefit from applying the cognitive footprint concept to other areas, such as the impact of environmental exposures or lifestyle interventions on mental functioning. “We would like to explore the cognitive footprint of a variety of interventions and effects—such as, at an individual level, the footprint of shift work, and at a population level, the effect of heat waves,” Rossor explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.70200" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Cognitive Footprint of Medication Use&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Marta Suárez Pinilla, Charlotte R.

Then came the acne.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common condition that affects a woman's ability to regularly release an egg for fertilisation.

It’s losing your period, wrecking your skin, and fighting your body every day. I know - because I didn’t have any symptoms… until I went carnivore. Now, I’m not saying carnivore is bad, I’m not against it at all. Some people thrive on it and have only seen positive effects. But for me? It destroyed my hormones. I lost my period. Developed PCOS. Broke out worse than ever. And my energy? Non-existent. Truth is, women’s hormones are EVERYTHING. And extreme diets can mess with them more than you think. And the worst part? PCOS doesn’t have a cure. You don’t fix it with a detox tea, cutting carbs, or some influencer’s magic supplement. You manage it - with the right food, training, and lifestyle that actually supports your hormones. PCOS isn’t a trend. It’s not an excuse. It’s not something you self-diagnose on TikTok. It’s real. 💙&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a title="♬ original sound - Georgia Heins" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7477251991270361878?refer=embed"&gt;♬ original sound - Georgia Heins&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Georgia Heins said she didn't have any symptoms of PCOS until she went on the carnivore diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Rajan explained that these symptoms can be caused by a lack of fibre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Some people might even feel fine on a carnivore diet, but I'd argue they are in the minority', he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent data shows that some 200,000 people in the UK look for information about the carnivore diet online every month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many, including celebrities like Joe Rogan, have championed the eating plan for its fat-burning abilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The high-protein, low-carb diet works by putting the body into a state of ketosis - forcing it to burn fat, rather than carbohydrate, for energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But this too can have devastating consequences for a woman's reproductive system, experts have warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lisa Goldstein, a leading nutritionist who specialises in reproductive health, said: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When you don't eat enough - especially too few carbs - your brain can switch off ovulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medically known as hypothalamic amenorrhea, this is the body's way of avoiding pregnancy when energy reserves are low, she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can be caused by being on a calorie-restrictive diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Unlike men, women's reproductive systems require a minimum threshold of calories, carbs and body fat to function', she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Carnivore diets have also been linked to increased risk of bowel cancer, heart disease, stroke and diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 11:33:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>通过食用1种食物来降低高血糖和相关的糖尿病风险- Surrey Live | Reduce high blood sugar and associated diabetes risk by eating 1 food item - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxQQlpacy1xOHUwRDVMUVJLWVhZOU10TVZzUC14ZldoU0g0d1E5SW04dkV4MXJld2VFYUt0d2tSNlh2aDhKSUg4LTE5ZHFEaUw0THZhOHpWSkRQeVo4azFfNnQ1eE8tTEZHUExHZGRNaTRZcVk4N2p1VnZLWTFwOHYyNERn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type 2 diabetes occurs when there is a problem with insulin in the body, leading to high blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;High blood sugar can lead to feelings of extreme thirst and hunger, blurred vision, and cuts taking longer to heal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; points out that these symptoms can "develop gradually", but if you've been diagnosed with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, now is the time to take control of your health. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Without paying special attention to your diet, high blood sugar left to run riot can damage blood vessels inside of the body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Damage to blood vessels can lead to coronary heart disease and increases the risk of a life-threatening stroke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class="read-more-links" data-mod="readMoreTweak" data-immediate=""&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;"You can lower your chances of complications by managing your blood glucose (sugar) as well as you can," the NHS notes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This could include eating more pulses, the charity Diabetes UK says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"All carbs affect blood glucose levels so it’s important to know which foods contain carbohydrates," the charity explains.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Choose the healthier foods that contain carbs and be aware of your portion sizes."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One such "healthy" carbohydrate source is pulses, which includes chickpeas, beans and lentils.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31500981" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the addition of these foods can help to reduce high blood sugar levels, other measures are required.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A healthy diet in general is recommended to help bring down high blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This includes fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats – such as nuts, seeds, avocado and oily fish.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Avoiding unhealthy foods is also highly recommended, which means reducing your intake (or avoiding):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Red and processed meat&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Ghee&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Butter&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Lard&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Biscuits&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Cakes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Pies&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Pastries&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Pre-packages foods&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Sugary foods&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Crisps&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Chips&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Biscuits&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Chocolates.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reducing alcohol consumption is also advised, as well as exercising on a frequent basis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, the NHS encourages everybody – whether you have high blood sugar or not – to move for at least 150 minutes each week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Being more physically active goes hand in hand with eating healthier," Diabetes UK added.

   &lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2022, I decided to try taking Ozempic to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At the time, I was an early adopter. The media frenzy about GLP1 agonists hadn't yet started. Even my own doctor was surprised at my request.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I haven't really prescribed them for weight loss much," she told me. "Have you tried Noom? Or meals from HelloFresh?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But I'm a primary care doctor, and I'd been following the scientific literature that showed GLP1 agonists could now be used specifically for weight loss. I wanted to try them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the end, I was also an early quitter: I stopped taking the drug within months of starting it. Ozempic made me nauseated, gave me heartburn, disrupted my sleep. It wasn't worth it.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;I was not alone, it turns out, in finding it difficult to stick with the Ozempic. New research shows the vast majority of people who try GLP-1 agonists for weight loss end up stopping them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And while many people benefit from these medications, I think doctors can learn from the fact that so many people give up on them, too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When I started thinking about giving Ozempic a try, I had given birth the year before. Like most women, I had gained weight in pregnancy. Also like most women, I thought I had to lose it all to "get healthy" again.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;My doctor's initial advice wasn't terrible – eating vegetables and regular exercise are indeed good for you — but I had heard it before. I had doled out the same recommendations to my own patients a million times, without much success.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the end, my doctor prescribed the Ozempic. When I gave myself my first injection, I was optimistic it would help me feel healthier.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Since then, I've started writing publicly about &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/10/04/1202723479/ozempic-body-positive-medicine-weight-stigma" target="_blank"&gt;being a size-inclusive physician&lt;/a&gt; who doesn't push my patients to lose weight. But at the time, I hadn't yet fully embraced a weight-neutral approach to caring for my patients — and caring for myself. After all, I had spent years of medical training absorbing the message that the only way to be healthy was to get down to a body mass index of 25 or below.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But my experience with Ozempic made me realize I had confused two distinct issues: Being healthy is not always the same thing as being thin.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;When I tried Ozempic, I had been struggling to get back into exercise after childbirth. With a baby at home disrupting my sleep, I felt sluggish all the time. I thought the medication might help me get more energized.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Instead, I started feeling almost immediately terrible. The heartburn was the first side effect I noticed, then the nausea. At a friend's wedding that summer, I toasted the couple with a glass of champagne, then spent the entire reception vomiting in a bathroom stall. I felt too sick to exercise. It was hard to sleep because of the abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I felt, in a word, unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I wasn't exactly systematic when I stopped taking it. I definitely didn't talk to my doctor about it. (Classic doctor behavior – we're the worst patients.) I just made excuses about skipping a week, and then another.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And I'm not the only one.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;My experience was not unique, new research shows. The majority of people who start GLP1 agonists end up stopping them, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2829779" target="_blank"&gt;according to research published earlier this year in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The study authors found that nearly 65% of study subjects who were taking the medications explicitly for weight loss, rather than diabetes control, ended up going off them within a year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It wasn't clear why individual patients stopped the drugs, but researchers found some common reasons. Patients who experienced significant side effects were more likely to quit the medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Patients with lower income levels were also more likely to quit, presumably because they couldn't afford them. (&lt;a href="https://whyy.org/articles/independence-blue-cross-restrict-coverage-ozempic-weight-loss/" target="_blank"&gt;A growing number of insurers&lt;/a&gt; are no longer covering the medications, because they're so expensive, which shifts the costs directly on to patients.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People who lost a significant amount of weight were another group who quit at a higher rate.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Or maybe, like me, some of those quitters felt healthier when they weren't taking the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;When I stopped the Ozempic, I slowly found myself feeling better. I started exercising again, taking my son in the jogging stroller and hiking with my family on the weekends. My sleep was less disrupted by an upset stomach. I allowed myself to enjoy food.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I didn't lose weight, but my blood pressure and glucose levels remained normal. I felt more vibrant and alive. My mental health was better. Was it possible that I could be healthy &lt;em&gt;without &lt;/em&gt;a BMI of 25?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lots of my fellow doctors don't think so. "Greater efforts are needed to increase access and adherence," the &lt;em&gt;JAMA &lt;/em&gt;researchers wrote in their article about GLP-1 discontinuation rates, the assumption being that the goal of doctors everywhere should be to get patients to take the medications — and stick to them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I'm not anti-Ozempic; far from it. I prescribe GLP-1s for many of my patients, and lots of them show improvement on metrics like blood glucose, hypertension, and kidney function. Many of my patients say the drugs help them lead much healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But a narrow focus on weight — which, so often, our medical training still teaches — misses the point that there's more to being well than a number on the scale. For me, I felt healthier at a higher weight because &lt;em&gt;stopping &lt;/em&gt;Ozempic helped me exercise regularly, sleep better, and feel less pain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some of my patients tell me similar stories. One woman told me that having a peaceful relationship with food is more important to her than a few pounds of weight loss. Another patient told me that "being skinny isn't worth feeling sick every day."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I worry that in the age of Ozempic, we doctors have returned to a myopic obsession with weight as the definition of health. Instead of focusing on objective measures like kidney function or liver inflammation, doctors instead hone in on BMI, a metric that the American Medical Association has denounced as &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/ama-use-bmi-alone-imperfect-clinical-measure" target="_blank"&gt;not rigorous enough &lt;/a&gt;to evaluate an individual patient's health. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Just look at the hand-wringing &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2819256" target="_blank"&gt;in another recent paper&lt;/a&gt; that showed high rates of people quitting GLP1s: "Discontinuation could have policy and medication coverage implications, especially if the weight reduction is not sustained after medications are discontinued," the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This comes even as &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/press-releases/ama-adopts-new-policy-clarifying-role-bmi-measure-medicine" target="_blank"&gt;major medical organizations&lt;/a&gt; are putting less and less emphasis on BMI and as &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/59/5/339" target="_blank"&gt;new research emerges&lt;/a&gt; that shows cardiovascular fitness may be more important than body weight as a predictor of disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As I try to help my patients navigate decisions about these medications, I keep returning to the core value of bodily autonomy. Health is multidimensional and deeply personal. My patients decide what it means to be well — with or without a GLP-1 drug.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mara Gordon is a family physician in Camden, N.J., and a contributor to NPR.

&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Body fat serves all sorts of valuable functions in your body, from storing certain vitamins to keeping you warm. But there’s one type of body fat that’s not-so-friendly for your health: visceral fat. Inside your abdominal cavity, this form of adipose tissue (fat tissue) surrounds critical organs, such as your stomach, liver and intestines. Fortunately, there’s one drink that can help you reduce visceral fat. Java lovers, rejoice! It’s &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research has linked drinking coffee to reductions in body fat. For instance, a 2025 study of over 45,000 people found that those who drank coffee (an average of 1.7 cups per day) had significantly lower visceral fat than non-coffee drinkers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Though it’s important to have a small amount of visceral fat for cushioning your organs, too much of it raises the risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, if you’re a regular coffee drinker, you can keep up the good work (in moderation). Or, if you don’t usually enjoy a morning brew, here’s why you may want to start if you’re trying to lose visceral fat.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So what is it about a daily cuppa coffee or two that might help with visceral fat? According to registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://coffeecopycat.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Megan Byrd, RD&lt;/a&gt;, several factors may be at play.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Caffeine May Support Your Metabolism &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coffee’s famous energy-boosting caffeine content could be one of its keys to decreasing visceral fat. Byrd says experts have long believed that caffeine’s ability to increase your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7937672/how-to-calculate-your-metabolism/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt; is the primary reason coffee may promote weight loss. However, she points out that a recent study did not find the same effect from green tea, which also contains caffeine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Coffee usually has more caffeine per ounce [than green tea], which can increase resting metabolic rate further.” In fact, some studies have established that coffee may raise metabolism by between 5% and 20% for at least three hours after consumption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Coffee Provides Antioxidants &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coffee gets lots of good press for its high content of antioxidants. Each cup contains anywhere from 200 to 550 milligrams of these beneficial plant compounds, more than green tea or red wine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Antioxidants help protect your body against cell damage.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Additionally, including plenty of antioxidants in your diet is another way to potentially reduce visceral fat. A 2024 study showed that eating more antioxidants may be associated with less visceral adipose tissue.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Specifically, says &lt;a href="https://fromthestartnutrition.com/meet-beth-conlon-new-jersey-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Beth Conlon, Ph.D., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, chlorogenic acids and cafestol, both found in coffee, are two antioxidants that may help lose visceral fat. “Studies have shown that chlorogenic acids can decrease abdominal fat, body weight and waist circumference,” she says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Cafestol, meanwhile, has been linked to reductions in body weight and visceral fat volume.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “It’s thought that these compounds can influence metabolism and fat breakdown, offering a potential mechanism behind coffee’s effects on visceral fat.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Coffee May Reduce Appetite &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;  Another potential benefit of caffeine for visceral fat is reducing your hunger levels. “The caffeine in coffee can stimulate the nervous system and potentially reduce appetite,” says Conlon. In this way, coffee could contribute to lower calorie intake, indirectly reducing abdominal fat over time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On the other hand, some research has yielded conflicting results about whether (and when) caffeine may suppress appetite, suggesting that the timing of coffee consumption may affect its impact on hunger. According to an older study, drinking coffee after a meal, rather than before, was more effective in reducing hunger.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Conlon notes, too, that coffee’s appetite reduction doesn’t mean you should replace meals with&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031960/drinking-coffee-on-an-empty-stomach/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; java alone&lt;/a&gt;. “Coffee itself is not a meal! It’s important to consume adequate nutrition and balanced meals throughout the day for good nutrition and health,” she says.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not every coffee beverage is a surefire way to lose visceral fat—&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7912339/the-best-and-worst-things-to-add-to-your-coffee-according-to-dietitians/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;what you put into your drink matters&lt;/a&gt;. “If you’re adding a lot of fats and sugars to your coffee, health benefits may not be as prevalent as just drinking your coffee black,” Byrd says. For most people, black coffee is an acquired taste, but Conlon says it offers the opportunity to explore different types of beans and roasting styles. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Then again, if you can’t get past black coffee’s astringent taste, there are plenty of other healthy options. Adding a splash of milk or milk alternatives like oat or almond can lend some sweetness to your coffee without tons of added sugar. “Also, being mindful of timing is important; enjoy your coffee earlier in the day so it doesn’t interfere with sleep,” Conlon says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Keeping excess visceral fat at bay involves a balance of diet, exercise and other healthy habits. Yet, regular coffee drinking might help, too. Stick to coffee drinks that don’t load you up on added sugars or fats—or, if you enjoy it black, keep sipping it that way.&lt;br&gt;

The 'blue' in blueberries could reduce the risk of heart disease by 20 per cent, according to a recent study. &lt;span&gt;Researchers found consuming 200g of blueberries a day for a month - a large punnet - improved blood vessel function and lowered blood pressure in healthy people&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; And the study suggests that the "super" berries could be just as effective as blood pressure pills prescribed by GPs from the doctor. &lt;span&gt;And it's all because of a magical chemical which gives the berry it's famous blue colouring, called anthocyanin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; High blood pressure is the leading cause of cardiovascular diseases and if ignored, could lead to heart attacks, strokes and kidney disease. &lt;span&gt;Researchers at Kings College London analysed the effects of drinking blueberry juice every day for one month - and the results could be life saving.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Lead researcher Doctor Ana Rodriguez-Mateos said: "Although it is best to eat the whole blueberry to get the full benefit, our study finds that the majority of the effects can be explained by anthocyanins. &lt;span&gt;If the changes we saw in blood vessel function after eating blueberries every day could be sustained for a person's whole life, it could reduce their risk of developing cardiovascular disease by up to 20 per cent."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lecturer in nutritional sciences explained: "Blueberries are rich in polyphenols, in particular anthocyanins, but also contain other phenolic compounds in smaller amounts such as procyanidins, flavonols and phenolic acids, as well as being a rich source of fibre, vitamins, and minerals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Blueberries have initially been investigated due to their potential beneficial effects on age-dependent decline in cognitive function but were recently shown to improve cardiovascular function.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Data from the Nurse's Heath Study II demonstrated that a high intake of blueberries and strawberries and the high intake of anthocyanins associated with it (as calculated based on food frequency questionnaires) was inversely associated with the risk of myocardial infarction."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; So the study involving 40 participants were either given a drink containing 200g of blueberries to drink every day or a placebo. &lt;span&gt;The blood pressure, urine and blood of all of the volunteers was tested, as well as their flow-mediated dilation (FMD) which measures how much the artery widens when blood flow increases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers compared the results of the blueberry and placebo drinkers and discovered that purified anthocyanins - the phytochemical which gives fruit and vegetables a blue, red, pink or purple colour - had a dramatic impact on blood pressure levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; They found drinking 200g of blueberries, blood vessel function significantly improved - within just two hours. &lt;span&gt;After one month of drinking the juice daily, blood pressure reduced by 5mmHg - a similar drop experienced by people who rely on blood lowering medication.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The drinks containing purified anthocyanins also led to improvements in endothelial function - which is crucial in regulating blood pressure and blood clotting. &lt;span&gt;Dr Rodriguez-Mateos said: "While blueberries contain many potentially 'healthy' bioactive molecules including vitamins, fibre and minerals, our present results demonstrate that anthocyanins are major bioactive compounds in blueberry that can account for the increases in endothelial function after blueberry consumption.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "Our data demonstrate for the first time that purified anthocyanins cause dose-dependent improvements in endothelial function. &lt;span&gt;In conclusion, our results demonstrate a key role of anthocyanin metabolites in the mediation of biological activities of blueberries that could contribute to healthy cardiovascular ageing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"We provide further scientific evidence that in healthy humans chronic blueberry consumption leads to sustained cardiovascular benefits which are linked with circulating anthocyanin metabolites and the modulation of cellular gene programs towards an anti-inflammatory and CVD protective profile."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study was published in the Journal of Gerontology Series A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 09:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxOckoxckJ2UFNoVjdVaEg2WG84RWpxd2dvb3N1bXo1bEN5MnN1dV9Ld3hPdnFFN0hqMm9CLVBzUDg3N00yQlhPdkd4TmI0Wm8ybDhVd3dUNGk4Y2RKUWZ1T0hsdnpwYkNIeU94S1AybzhUamxQb1ZvRnB5aW1HeXpKSnNVQljSAYoBQVVfeXFMTUVIZWQwLUZxU3g2ZWZrMzRZWlB3d3VIaVM4MG9aQzZCSEhLNU9PRWNQYmYtWmlTb29DSjY5WUE0TS1ySE1BLTBpUHBzTUxXY1Z2TE5yZ1ZmYzgxek1wcGpCdWg3NHZxRHZDWUJoWVh0YjNQU3B0dG41ZWxISlhXMHM0Z3hGeWdKbE5R</guid></item><item><title>大量的传染病正从融化的冰层中爆发。我们现在还不应该惊慌失措- Salon.com | A torrent of infectious diseases is erupting from melting ice.

								&lt;input type="hidden" id="article_url" value="2025/04/24/a-torrent-of-infectious-diseases-is-erupting-from-melting-ice-we-shouldnt-freak-out-just-yet/"&gt;
																	
																
								&lt;p&gt;You may feel that we all have enough to worry about, and thus have no need for the spectre of &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/10/30/zombies-in-nature-halloween-science/" target="_blank"&gt;zombie-like reanimated bacteria&lt;/a&gt; or viruses in thawing permafrost that set off a story straight out of a sci-fi flick. Unfortunately, it's a looming reality thanks to climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, scientists tell us that while it's high time we thought carefully about how we are going to manage the vast numbers of microbes being released along with equally vast quantities of melting ice and thawing permafrost as a result of global heating, there is no need to panic nor to sensationalize the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Salon spoke with microbiologist Luis Andrés Yarzábal, an associate professor at the Universidad Católica de Cuenca in Ecuador, he was indeed careful to avoid sensationalizing the problem. But he noted that we've been aware since the '80s of dramatic quantities of microbes found in even the most pristine of Antarctic ice sheets or on top of mountains, such as the Andean glaciers, and in permafrost. The host of life on ice includes bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, even microscopic animals like nematodes, some dead and some alive in suspended animation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yarzábal actually started studying the microbiology of the Andean glaciers, beginning in Venezuela 17 years ago, because he and his team were interested in the biotechnological potential of cold-loving, or psychrophile, microorganisms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They can be used, for instance, for agricultural purposes, to improve agriculture in cold regions, in mountainous regions." But the country's glaciers melted, and as they did, it revealed huge numbers of pathogens in the melting ice. Some of these disease-causing bugs may be so old, human immune systems are totally naïve to them, which means unleashing them could infect millions, maybe even trigger another pandemic. The odds of such an event may be remote — we don't actually know how likely this all is — but we do know the likelihood isn't zero and it will increase as the world's ice retreats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Venezuela is now the first country in the modern world to have lost all its glaciers, and there were many, many pathogens," Yarzábal said. Some are very similar to modern human pathogens. From bioprospecting beneficial microbes, he was now forced to consider less cheery possibilities. After all, Venezuela's lost glaciers were far from the only ones releasing water that has been frozen for tens or hundreds of thousands of years. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08545-z" target="_blank"&gt;Newly published research in Nature suggests that&lt;/a&gt; between 2000 and 2023, the world's glaciers lost some 275  gigatonnes, give or take, in mass annually, with the rate of melting increasing substantially more recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disrupting the ecological equilibrium always has the potential to cause hazards to human health directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The rate at which we lost ice during these 23 years is approximately the amount of water contained in four Olympic pools, per second. So that's a lot of microbes that will disperse around the ecosystems, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems," said Yarzábal, who &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352004313_Climate_change_melting_cryosphere_and_frozen_pathogens_Should_we_worry" target="_blank"&gt;published a 2021 review with two colleagues exploring&lt;/a&gt; existing literature regarding the consequences of such a large store of microbes being steadily released back into the environment. And that's just glaciers. There are still the thawing permafrost and melting ice sheets to take into account. All of these, however unpolluted, contain their own microbial worlds. Worlds with between ten and 100 million microbes per milliliter of ice, depending on the kind of ice, Yarzábal said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are talking [altogether] about an amount of microorganisms which has been estimated between 10^25 and 10^28 microorganisms enclosed, entrapped in ice prisons ... So it's a huge amount of microorganisms ... Consider that there are 10^23 stars in the universe," Yarzábal told Salon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, he said, while many of these captive microbes are dead, plenty of them are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In this group of viable microorganisms, there are some ancient ancestral pathogens, which can also reactivate ... and they can disseminate in different ecosystems and they can, of course, infect animals, plants and other microbes," Yarzábal said. Any of these could pose a problem, whether it's because we're talking about a virus that is deadly for humans, or a bacteria that infects livestock, or a type of fungus, say, that can blight plants. Disrupting the ecological equilibrium always has the potential to cause hazards to human health directly, or to risk altering or damaging the environment we depend upon or merely appreciate for its intrinsic value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This is a fact," said Yarzábal. "So we can see it as a threat, and we can anticipate this problem by studying these pathogens or these microbes, by studying the ecology of glaciers and permafrost. It's a fact, so we must be prepared for what can happen."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Already we've had a warning of what could happen: in 2016, Siberia had &lt;span&gt;an extremely hot summer. The permafrost melted, exposing in the process the frozen carcasses of reindeer who had died an estimated 150 years before thanks to an epidemic of anthrax. While the animals were dead, some of the bacteria in them had remained alive, and when curious living reindeer came into contact with the remains of their frozen ancestors, they became infected with the spore-forming bacteria, &lt;em&gt;Bacillus anthracis&lt;/em&gt;. As Yarzábal told Salon, almost 2,500 animals died and many hundreds of people (who, in this area, are in close contact with reindeer, relying on them as a source of protein for food and commerce) became infected, with at least one small human child dying as a result.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt="Permafrost under the layer of soil" class="inserted_image" data-image_id="15056106" id="featured_image_img" src="https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/600/https://media2.salon.com/2025/02/permafrost_under_the_layer_of_soil_2196693440.jpg"&gt;&lt;strong class="article_img_desc insert_image"&gt;Permafrost under the layer of soil (Getty Images/Stasz D Sirotkin)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;While Yarzábal is at work in the Southern hemisphere, in the far North, Dr. &lt;span&gt;Emilie Andersen-Ranberg, senior veterinarian at the Department for Veterinary Clinical Sciences at the University of Copenhagen, has been studying Arctic pathogens that are zoonotic, meaning they cause illnesses that can spread between animals and humans. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Not all zoonotic pathogens in the Arctic are frozen, mind you, and not all frozen pathogens in the Arctic are zoonotic. But about three quarters of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; human infectious diseases are zoonotic, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808746/#:~:text=Although%20about%2060%25%20of%20novel,40%25%20have%20other%20origins2." target="_blank"&gt;including the majority of novel epidemics and pandemics in recent years&lt;/a&gt;, and there's overlap with the issue of thawing permafrost. In &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969724070268?via%3Dihub&amp;amp;__cf_chl_tk=JOFT_HErB.9yw0pWk.DTtI5Sf1yVWIWXfqdpLZQn.dE-1744945773-1.0.1.1-NUJH6yIoBmeBgX8RkqnPSbEazvn3SqtT3ylZR4HHw0c" target="_blank"&gt;a paper published in December&lt;/a&gt;, Andersen-Ranberg and a host of co-authors describe zoonotic viruses, bacteria and parasites of concern in the Arctic, arguing that "&lt;/span&gt;the Arctic represents a changing world where pollution, loss of biodiversity and habitat, and maritime activity are likely driving forward occurrence of infectious diseases", with thawing permafrost being one factor among many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;How concerned should we really be about thawing zoonotic infections? In an email interview, Andersen-Ranberg told Salon that's not exactly clear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="left_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There is not necessarily grounds to fear that the viruses in the frozen environment are more pathogenic&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We simply don’t exactly know. There is, however, a clear theoretical risk since glaciers and permafrost are melting and they store millennia old microbes and some of these organisms have been found to revive and re-function after thawing," she said. "For example, a wide array of both RNA and DNA viruses have been detected in thawing permafrost and have been able to re-activate, [such as] RNA viruses that are highly similar to viruses that today infect mammals. On the other hand, we are constantly exposed to potentially pathogenic viruses from various natural sources, and there is not necessarily grounds to fear that the viruses in the frozen environment are more pathogenic."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She did note, however, that thawing permafrost could re-introduce ancient pathogenic viruses that are now extinct, or where today's strains have evolved to have such a different genetic makeup that our (or other mammals') immune systems are less able to detect and fight off the ancient strains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such pathogens would be unknown to our immune systems, as smallpox was to the immune systems of the Indigenous people who &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2013/05/04/a_lost_plague_remembering_canadas_smallpox_epidemic_partner/" target="_blank"&gt;encountered it as a result of European colonizers&lt;/a&gt; who brought the virus to the Americas, Australasia and elsewhere, leading to mass deaths from succeeding waves of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not just the resurgence of ancient diseases, but the fact that pathogens can and will trade genetic information if they come into contact with one another, a process known as viral recombination. Bacteria are also "promiscuous," easily exchanging genetic material. This could allow them to acquire genes from frozen pathogens that confer &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/07/12/climate-change-could-return-us-to-the-pre-antibiotic-era/" target="_blank"&gt;antimicrobial resistance&lt;/a&gt; or greater virulence. As it's common for hosts like humans or other animals to harbor more than one infection at once, there can be plenty of opportunities for gene transfer to occur. Therefore, infectious agents released from melting ice "represents an even greater pool of genetic viral diversity to be introduced in already circulating viral populations," Andersen-Ranberg explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This for example means more potential ways to avoid the immune system of the host, or an increased ability to infect a variety of hosts," Andersen-Ranberg added. "Moreover, this melt-induced introduction of potential pathogens occurs simultaneously with other great changes to disease dynamics worldwide currently occurring due to climate change and changing human activities. Put simply, it's a lot happening all at once." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can or should we be doing about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I don't know," Yarzábal acknowledged soberly. That is, beyond what he already recommended — we must do far more to anticipate potential disease outbreaks or reoccurrences and to understand the specific pathogens we're likely to encounter. The microbiologist is not sure what other action we might take, practically-speaking, as vast areas of ice and permafrost unleash the microorganisms they've been hanging onto all these years. Unless we reduce emissions enough to keep some of those frozen pathogens in ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Aerial view above the glaciers melting into the permafrost of Jostedalsbreen National Park" class="inserted_image" data-image_id="15050676" id="featured_image_img" src="https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/600/https://media2.salon.com/2024/06/glacial_melt_rivers_lakes_jostedalsbreen_national_park_1784183054.jpg"&gt;&lt;strong class="article_img_desc insert_image"&gt;Aerial view above the glaciers melting into the permafrost of Jostedalsbreen National Park (Getty Images/MICHAEL WORKMAN)&lt;/strong&gt;Beyond that, this is a genie that can't be put back in its bottle, only monitored and managed as it plays its tricks. But that monitoring and containment of potential disease outbreaks will be absolutely critical to protect us. In 2019, the European Academies Science Advisory Council &lt;a href="https://easac.eu/fileadmin/PDF_s/reports_statements/Climate_Change_and_Health/EASAC_CCH_Main_Report_WEB_2August.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;issued a report&lt;/a&gt; that noted that pathogen release of infectious disease from thawing permafrost was one among various ways climate change could affect human health in Europe. And that same year, EASAC along with the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) and InterAcademy Partnership, a global network of science, engineering and medicine societies, brought researchers and public health officials together from North America, the European Union and Russia to assess the current state of knowledge and gaps in knowledge relating to the risks similarly posed by infectious agents in thawing Arctic permafrost and ice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we really need much more scientific investigation to understand the degree of threat such pathogens may pose to human, animal and ecosystem health, Yarzábal said. Meanwhile, the Arctic Council, which brings together Arctic countries and Indigenous Arctic communities to share knowledge and discuss policy affecting the region, &lt;a href="https://cphpost.dk/2024-07-01/news/politics/denmark-will-chair-the-arctic-council-in-2025-what-is-it-up-against/" target="_blank"&gt;has been weakened in recent years by&lt;/a&gt; political divisions, and different nations' territorial ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"To me, there is a mind-blowing gap between the knowledge and worries of scientists and the opinions and aims of decision makers, i.e. an incongruent relationship between knowledge and political realities," Andersen-Ranberg told Salon. "I find this most noteworthy, because there is such relatively little emphasis on and monitoring of zoonoses as well as emerging/reemerging disease in the Arctic — an area subjected to the greatest degree of climate change in the world which currently drastically changes disease dynamics."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This decrease is due, in part, to improvements in controlling major stroke risk factors such as high cholesterol and &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/no-one-wants-high-blood-090047558.html" data-ylk="slk:high blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant improvements are still needed, however, as someone in the country is dying of stroke &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/data-research/facts-stats/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:about every three minutes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;about every three minutes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what a stroke is, what causes it and what treatment usually looks like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is a stroke?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two main types of stroke. An ischemic stroke is what happens when something blocks the arteries or reduces blood flow from the heart to the brain. This blockage deprives brain tissue of vital oxygen and nutrients, which causes brain cells to die within minutes. Sometimes called a brain attack, a hemorrhagic stroke is caused by blood vessels in the brain bursting or leaking, which increases pressure on brain cells and kills or damages them. "About 85% of strokes are ischemic and about 15% are hemorrhagic," says Dr. Lawrence Wechsler, a professor of neurology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When brain cells are damaged in either way, it can cause difficulty seeing out of one or both eyes, numbness in the face, legs or arms (which usually manifests more on one side of the body than the other), a sudden and&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/dealing-migraine-heres-rid-according-090305173.html" data-ylk="slk:acute headache;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt; acute headache&lt;/a&gt; or slurred speech/difficulty talking. "General confusion or difficulty understanding speech can be another sign to look out for," says Dr. Jonathon Parker, a neurosurgeon at Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some strokes are more severe than others, with people experiencing only mild confusion or a drooping smile while others can lose mobility or even consciousness. "The severity depends on which part of the brain is affected and how long the brain goes without blood flow – which is why some strokes can sadly be life-threatening," explains Dr. Rosy Thachil, director of the cardiovascular intensive care unit at NYC Health + Hospitals/Elmhurst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="exclude-from-newsgate"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No one wants high blood pressure. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/no-one-wants-high-blood-090047558.html" data-ylk="slk:Here's the secret to keeping it low (but not too low).;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;Here's the secret to keeping it low (but not too low).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What causes strokes?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ischemic stroke is caused by blood vessels becoming narrowed or arteries being blocked by fatty deposits. Other forms of blockage include "plaque buildup in the arteries or &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/08/08/sugar-substitute-erythritol-blood-clots/74691702007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:blood clots;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;blood clots&lt;/a&gt; from the heart," says Wechsler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leaks and ruptures associated with a hemorrhagic stroke can be the result of any number of things that include head trauma, bulges at weak spots in blood vessel walls (known as aneurysms) or uncontrolled &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/blood-pressure-may-change-age-090131900.html" data-ylk="slk:high blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these various causes are preventable or modifiable, explains Dr. John Hanna, a vascular neurologist for the Atlantic Health System in New Jersey. This is why risk factors such as &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/09/26/obesity-rate-in-america-us-chart/75367963007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:obesity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, smoking, excessive drinking and limited physical activity are all recommended against. Medical conditions such as type 2 diabetes, &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/sleep-apnea-sleep-disorder-might-100017819.html" data-ylk="slk:sleep apnea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;, high cholesterol and high blood pressure commonly increase one's risk of stroke and are also often within a person's control to reduce or avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Atrial fibrillation, which is a specific type of &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/healthy-resting-heart-rate-experts-090021040.html" data-ylk="slk:irregular heartbeat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;irregular heartbeat&lt;/a&gt;, can be another risk factor," adds Parker; and taking certain medications is yet another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two non-avoidable factors that predispose some individuals to vascular issues like stroke are getting older and genetics/a family history of heart disease, says Thachil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="exclude-from-newsgate"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is sleep apnea? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/sleep-apnea-sleep-disorder-might-100017819.html" data-ylk="slk:The sleep disorder you might have could be why you're sluggish;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;The sleep disorder you might have could be why you're sluggish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the best treatment for stroke?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's critical to get medical treatment as soon as a stroke begins to improve recovery time and diminish or avoid longer-term damage, disability or death. If you suspect a person may be having a stroke, the "F.A.S.T." warning signs can help – as recommended by the &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org/en/about-stroke/stroke-symptoms" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Stroke Association.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Stroke Association.&lt;/a&gt; This acronym includes signs of stroke to look out for that include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;.  Face drooping to one side that will be obvious if you ask the person to smile and it appears uneven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;. Arm weakness or numbness that may be apparent if you ask the person to raise both arms and they can't lift one or one arm drifts downward after being raised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;. Speech difficulty such as being hard to get words our or words that sound slurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;. Time to call 911 if you identify such signs, as a stroke is a medical emergency that requires immediate care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once in the hospital, "treatment depends on the type and severity of the stroke," says Thachil. Ischemic strokes, he explains, may be treated with clot-busting medications like tPA, or, in more severe cases, with specialized devices introduced through a catheter. "Hemorrhagic strokes require a different approach and are typically managed by neurosurgery," says Hanna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/jay-leno-undergoing-very-aggressive-213356728.html" data-ylk="slk:oxygen stabilization;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;oxygen stabilization&lt;/a&gt; and treatment, blood thinning or antiplatelet medications are often prescribed to decrease the patient's risk of having another stroke. Blood pressure and cardiovascular health are also carefully monitored going forward to prevent future damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Recovery approaches such as rehab, medications and/or lifestyle changes," says Thachil, "are tailored to the needs of each individual patient based on the extent of their brain injury."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2025/04/24/what-is-a-stroke/83165459007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:What is a stroke?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;What is a stroke?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 09:06:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5PNktXd3lDcGJ4NjZYcGZWRmZzODh2S1lLNjRDWkxtWXdiRGNmR1lueEoxc0hkZ2xFSWZGTEFPQndCUllFcW1jOWlaU2lPbkRJdFQ4R2VrSm9ZM2k4Umw2QWxWVTA5UHBvS0toS1h5VU03RXc</guid></item><item><title>随着疾病的增加，援助削减扰乱了儿童疫苗计划-路透社 | Aid cuts disrupt childhood vaccine programmes as diseases rise - Reuters</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1wFBVV95cUxNY0tBcWVGaWVEalBXWERZVE85Uk56Rl9DMGVMOElRMjZ0bWc2S3djOTk2NTlpVmJOMmJ0NjhZZEd0T1FSOTlRNVhuYjJyMFRZNlUxNTZVMGxvM0YxYWFfUEkwcGNuaWtTS1k4ZG5LdkFyWV9aeFZ6d3NBUnR5SnRmdC1ld05kQU5XT2tMUzF5a21PNTlsX2lfNFByZm1XTHpYNFpvUWc1V09MSE5MMDZSUnh2RkY3ZHd3Y3NVN0lvWkhLdDdkVEcwVWxrckYzRHJTb3dZVmhXTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 07:09:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1wFBVV95cUxNY0tBcWVGaWVEalBXWERZVE85Uk56Rl9DMGVMOElRMjZ0bWc2S3djOTk2NTlpVmJOMmJ0NjhZZEd0T1FSOTlRNVhuYjJyMFRZNlUxNTZVMGxvM0YxYWFfUEkwcGNuaWtTS1k4ZG5LdkFyWV9aeFZ6d3NBUnR5SnRmdC1ld05kQU5XT2tMUzF5a21PNTlsX2lfNFByZm1XTHpYNFpvUWc1V09MSE5MMDZSUnh2RkY3ZHd3Y3NVN0lvWkhLdDdkVEcwVWxrckYzRHJTb3dZVmhXTQ</guid></item><item><title>年轻人的肠癌正在上升。儿童毒素暴露可能是原因-《独立报》 | Bowel cancer in young people is on the rise.

It's produced by a specific strain of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;, distinct from the strains associated with infections like diarrhoea. This finding offers a new avenue for understanding and potentially addressing the concerning trend of bowel cancer in younger demographics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers, including from the UK and backed by &lt;a href="/topic/cancer-research-uk"&gt;Cancer Research UK&lt;/a&gt;, found that exposure to colibactin in early &lt;a href="/topic/childhood"&gt;childhood&lt;/a&gt; imprints a genetic signature on the DNA of bowel cells, which may then &lt;a href="/topic/increase"&gt;increase&lt;/a&gt; the risk of

aged 25-49 in the UK every year and around 44,100 new cases among all ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work has been ongoing to discover why more younger people are developing bowel cancer, with experts believing poor diet, more ultra-processed foods, obesity and a lack of exercise are playing a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now in the latest study, led by the University of California San Diego (UCSD) and published in the journal Nature, researchers have uncovered another possible culprit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts examined 981 colorectal (bowel) cancer genomes from patients with both early and late-onset disease in 11 different countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found colibactin can leave behind specific patterns of DNA mutations that are 3.3 times more common in early-onset bowel cancer cases (in the study this was adults under 40) than in those diagnosed after the age of 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These mutation patterns were also particularly common in countries with a higher rate of early-onset bowel cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1kgrxrh-0 IuFeK"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-1kgrxrh-3 bCcmfs"&gt;Symptoms of bowel cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="sc-1kgrxrh-4 gFApdk"&gt;According to

cause anaemia (when you have fewer red blood cells than usual), which can make you feel very tired, short of breath and have headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior author, Ludmil Alexandrov, a professor at UCSD, said: “These mutation patterns are a kind of historical record in the genome, and they point to early-life exposure to colibactin as a driving force behind early-onset disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study first author Marcos Diaz-Gay, a former postdoctoral researcher, said: “When we started this project, we weren’t planning to focus on early-onset colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our original goal was to examine global patterns of colorectal cancer to understand why some countries have much higher rates than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But as we dug into the data, one of the most interesting and striking findings was how frequently colibactin-related mutations appeared in the early-onset cases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that colibactin-related mutations account for around 15% of what are known as APC driver mutations – some of the earliest genetic alterations that directly promote cancer development – in bowel cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If someone acquires one of these driver mutations by the time they’re 10 years old, they could be decades ahead of schedule for developing colorectal cancer, getting it at age 40 instead of 60,” Professor Alexandrov said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work is part of Cancer Grand Challenges team Mutographs, funded by Cancer Research UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are now developing early detection tests that analyse stool samples for colibactin-related mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The director of Cancer Grand Challenges, Dr David Scott, said: “Globally and in the UK, we’re witnessing an alarming increase in some types of cancer in people under the age of 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is unlikely that there will be one clear driver but Cancer Grand Challenges scientists are racing to solve this puzzle, and our Mutographs team has uncovered a surprising clue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many early-onset colorectal cancer patients appear to have been exposed to a toxin, called colibactin, produced by some strains of the bacteria E. coli in early life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s unclear how the exposure originates, but we suspect that a combination of factors – including diet – may intersect during a crucial phase in the development of the gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study adds an important piece to the puzzle of early-onset cancers, but it isn’t conclusive, and more research will be needed to establish a definitive link between colibactin and an increased risk of early-onset colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Other Cancer Grand Challenges teams, like Optimisticc and Prospect, are looking deeper into the microbiome and other environmental factors to uncover what’s behind the global rise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr
