Kennedy Jr. testified that vaccines are exempt from pre-licensure safety studies. Is it actually the case that vaccines are approved without safety studies?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="S6SOOTGJQZCJVENEEN3VPEQQPU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;No, this is not true. Vaccines undergo rigorous safety testing and are continuously monitored for adverse events. They go through &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/development-approval-process-cber/vaccine-development-101" target="_blank"&gt;several stages&lt;/a&gt; of clinical trials before approval (known as licensure), with thousands of people studied to prove safety and effectiveness before vaccines are cleared for the general public. In addition to extensive preapproval safety testing, vaccines are continuously monitored for any problems — often for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="S7CJMDYMLVDDZL2AUKGR3K6YSI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There are several ways that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and ACIP, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices within the CDC, do this continuous monitoring. One is via the Vaccine Safety Datalink, which researchers use to analyze health data from millions of people to find any adverse impacts of immunizations. Another is CISA, the Clinical Immunization Safety Project, a national network of CDC vaccine safety experts and research centers that investigates any potential health issues following immunization and works directly with patients to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PNWY5MKR3JFB7M45O3QGUJEABY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There’s also VAERS, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which allows individuals to submit potential issues following vaccination. This self-reported data, in conjunction with other ongoing testing, can help experts identify whether reported side effects are in fact tied to the vaccines themselves. Pharmaceutical companies do their own product safety studies as well. Vaccine experts told us that vaccines are &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; safety-tested than other medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IGC4GCAGUFDXXKBDVEJV5KB4QQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/01/28/rfk-jr-disparaged-vaccines-dozens-times-recent-years-misled-race/" target="_blank"&gt;long disparaged vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and often speaks about the need to placebo-test them — referring to a process in which one group gets vaccinated while the other does not. The Washington Post found that in at least &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/11/rfk-jr-vaccine-testing-concerns/" target="_blank"&gt;34 appearances&lt;/a&gt; before becoming secretary, he called for placebo-controlled studies for vaccines that have already been approved for use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="H5W7KCYRDNCDFEEHF4XCGHL4FU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kennedy often says he is not anti-vaccine but is seeking to restore “gold standard” science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2L5TH7VHQVHNXNRUH43IJP6S3Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Vaccines for diseases that don’t have an existing one — such as the original coronavirus vaccine — &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; undergo this testing. For diseases that have an available vaccine, new vaccines are tested against older versions — and public health experts say it would be unethical to deprive people of a vaccine that would protect them from harmful or deadly pathogens. Doing so would be like not giving a thousand children in Chicago an immunization while their neighbors got vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XF2NODKMEVGULOUCT6H6RP7AXU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In early May, Kennedy’s HHS &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/30/rfk-jr-vaccine-testing/" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that all new vaccines would be required to undergo placebo testing but did not clarify what would count as a “new vaccine.” When pressed by a senator about what he meant during a hearing in front of the Appropriations Committee on Tuesday, Kennedy went back on his previous statements to say, “I don’t think that it’s ethical to go back and retest those vaccines against the placebo. ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X3RPWH4MYBHVPLWGIERZ56HU7M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a response to a lightly edited question &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/05/16/rfk-health-vaccines-questions-answers/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;we received from a reader&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 02:14:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE51RUlWM0VJNVpoRVZnTjM3elhlRmlyMHFpUS0xb2dsYWlOSzhwS1cyejYzS1RzODBuN0pGd3dmekFwM2hjQVlsSy1WTjlTWnI0QW1UNHFsQlF5d2hLbkVSUjBNdVotNXR4QjNjS0hXb3E4MUFXQjVMUkR5Nlk</guid></item><item><title>发现新的西澳麻疹病例-《西雅图时报》 | New WA measles case identified -

The focus will mainly be on gay and bisexual men with a history of multiple sexual partners or an STI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The vaccine is 30-40% effective, but NHS England hopes it will reverse soaring numbers of infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There were more than 85,000 cases in 2023 – the highest since records began in 1918.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Gonorrhoea does not always have symptoms, but they can include pain, unusual discharge, inflammation of the genitals and infertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;How many people will chose to be immunised is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But projections by Imperial College London show that if the jab proves popular then it could &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/laninf/PIIS1473-3099(21)00744-1.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;prevent 100,000 cases and save the NHS nearly £8m over the next decade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Max, a sexual health campaigner, told BBC Newsbeat he would "100%" take the vaccine &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly3el161k3o" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;after being diagnosed with gonorrhoea twice within a year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I think this is great that it's been announced", he says, adding: "It's going to take the pressure off the clinics, it's just a big win all round."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Vaccination will start in August and will be offered through sexual health services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Public Health Scotland said it was also working on plans to launch its own programme for high-risk individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;BBC Newsbeat has asked health bodies in Wales and Northern Ireland whether they intend to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;Is it effective enough?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This vaccine wasn't designed for gonorrhoea. It's the meningitis B vaccine currently given to babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But the bacteria that cause the two diseases are so closely related that the MenB jab appears to cut gonorrhoea cases by around a third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;That will require a delicate conversation in sexual health clinics as the vaccine will not eliminate the risk of catching gonorrhoea. It is normally caught while having sex without a condom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But Prof Andrew Pollard, the chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which recommended the vaccine, said despite it only being 30% effective, it was "worth having" and could have "a huge impact" overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The decision is not just about the record numbers of cases. Gonorrhoea is becoming increasingly difficult to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Most cases are treated with a single dose of antibiotics, but there is an 80-year history of the bacterium which causes gonorrhoea repeatedly evolving resistance to our antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It's happening to the current treatments too and is why some doctors &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/antibiotic-resistant-gonorrhoea-cases-rising-in-england#:~:text=Katy%20Sinka%2C%20Consultant%20Epidemiologist%20and,pelvic%20inflammatory%20disease%20and%20infertility" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;are concerned gonorrhoea could one-day become untreatable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The best way to deal with a drug-resistant infection is to never catch it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Amanda Doyle, from NHS England, said: "The launch of a world-first routine vaccination for gonorrhoea is a huge step forward for sexual health and will be crucial in protecting individuals, helping to prevent the spread of infection and reduce the rising rates of antibiotic resistant strains of the bacteria."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The people most affected by gonorrhoea in the UK are those aged 16-to-25, gay and bisexual men, and those of black and Caribbean ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The vaccine – which costs around £8 per dose – is value for money when primarily offered to gay and bisexual men, rather than all teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, clinicians do have the freedom to use their own judgement and offer the vaccine to people using sexual health services they think are of equally high risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;People will be offered mpox (formerly known as monkeypox), HPV and hepatitis vaccines at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof Matt Phillips, president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, said: "This is excellent news and a landmark moment for sexual health in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Gonorrhoea diagnoses are at their highest since records began and this has the potential to help us to turn that around."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It is not known how long the protection provided by the vaccine will last or how often booster jabs might be required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The decision comes almost a year and a half after a vaccination programme was recommended by the UK's JCVI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Sexual health campaigners had criticised that long wait, but have welcomed this decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Katie Clark, head of policy and advocacy at the Terrance Higgins Trust, called it a "huge win".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Listen to Newsbeat &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/live:bbc_radio_one" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt; at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006wkry/episodes/player" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 00:13:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1rVDdtYUhSZjV3emMtWFlWVWZ0RDhvSjdSWTJ5ekdHVk55anFXbEJhNnpSVElkWnluNzhxVW9EbWl0cXlpdXYtNGxlNWlFMGs5M2RsX21QQlpEd9IBX0FVX3lxTE13d1pVRVh3MmJmcnE3N2E5c0RlYS1kbExpTDNVbDJ2OTJxREN1Rk0xTHBtMlNORzl4VFBfVjF4YUNzMm5qWFdUSmtxMDRjRkJkX0p2YUtyS1U3S1c4dTZJ</guid></item><item><title>红肉对心脏有害吗？这可能取决于谁资助了这项研究。-《纽约时报》 | Is Red Meat Bad for Your Heart?

Red meat appeared healthier in studies that were funded by the red meat industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Of course, this is not surprising to anyone familiar with nutrition research, which often has conflicts of interest because of a lack of federal funding. But it is yet another example of how industry-linked studies might shape the way people understand, and potentially misunderstand, the health consequences of what they eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Past research funded by the sugar industry, for instance, has downplayed the relationship between sugar and health conditions &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/well/eat/how-the-sugar-industry-shifted-blame-to-fat.html" title=""&gt;like obesity and heart disease&lt;/a&gt;. And studies &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/health/nih-alcohol-study-liquor-industry.html" title=""&gt;funded by the alcohol industry&lt;/a&gt; have suggested that moderate drinking could be part of a healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Miguel López Moreno, a researcher at Francisco de Vitoria University in Spain who led the new analysis, said in an email that he wanted to know if similar issues were happening with the research on unprocessed red meat.

&lt;p&gt;“The New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) is alerting residents about potential exposures associated with a newly identified case of measles in a non-NJ resident who attended a concert in NJ while infectious,” officials said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warning was issued for those who attended Shakira’s concert on Thursday night into Friday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said that potentially exposed individuals “could develop symptoms as late as June 6.” Those could include high fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes and a facial or hairline rash that tends to appear within five days of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-papQS7n5" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_papQS7n5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where in the stadium the infected person was seated, where they live and how they arrived to the concert isn’t clear. Due to a &lt;a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/18/nj-transit-strike-over-tentative-agreement-reached/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New Jersey Transit strike that’s since been resolved&lt;/a&gt;, Garden State buses and trains were not operating when Shakira performed, though Coach USA buses brought some passengers from Port Authority to New Jersey for the shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While vaccinations protect against measles, the World Health Organization says there’s&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; no specific treatment&lt;/a&gt; for the very preventable yet highly infectious virus. The New York State Department of Health has recorded &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/measles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;five cases of measles in New York City&lt;/a&gt; and six cases outside the five boroughs so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem’s much worse in Texas, where 722 people had tested positive as of Tuesday. &lt;a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/06/measles-outbreak-second-child-dies-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Two unvaccinated children&lt;/a&gt; with no underlying health conditions have &lt;a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/26/measles-death-texas-outbreak-first-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;died from measles&lt;/a&gt; since late February, according to health officials in the Lone Star State.&lt;/p&gt;

The review calculated that by 2100, 1.9 billion adolescents would be living with the effects of global heating, which bring “catastrophic risks” to their wellbeing such as heat-related illness and food and water insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Areas in which some progress had been made included substance misuse, with the proportion of 10- to 24-year-olds smoking or drinking alcohol declining in every region. The number of young people not in education, work or training also reduced, the report found. But “progress has been undermined by the Covid-19 pandemic and a chronic lack of funding”, the authors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Sarah Baird, from George Washington University in the US and co-chair of the Lancet commission, said: “The health and wellbeing of adolescents worldwide is at a tipping point … Investing in the health and wellbeing of young people is crucial for safeguarding our collective future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The report concluded: “Without political will, policy initiatives and financial investment … large numbers of adolescents will grow up with poor health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Anshu Banerjee, director of maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health and ageing at the World &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Organization, said: “Advancing the health and rights of young people is the foundation of a better future for us all. From ending child marriage to tackling the mental health crisis and obesity, we must confront both old and emerging threats to their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Every young person deserves access to essential health services and information – without stigma or discrimination. As backlash against gender equality grows and harmful commercial influences spread, standing up for young people’s health and rights is more urgent than ever. These problems do not know national boundaries, neither should our solutions. This is why international collaboration to promote, protect, maintain and restore young people’s health and wellbeing is more important than ever.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Johanna Ralston, the chief executive of the World &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/obesity" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Obesity&lt;/a&gt; Federation, said: “This commission makes clear what many of us have long warned: the health of the world’s adolescents is being undermined by failing food and health systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The rise in obesity and related diseases is not just a matter of individual choices – it’s the result of environments flooded with health-harming products including ultra-processed food, alongside policies that fail to protect young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Governments must act urgently to create healthier food and health systems and prioritise adolescent wellbeing in national health strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 22:40:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxPRTR4YlVFRDJQbzFhN1Y4MzZDMmF1UWl3RTZ3NzVJRTNtUHhLSE1rd2ZPSnZaX1FXREFhMWNXbnFIOGk2Qi11MHRoWHNKYmpCaUVZQkY4VWlxUmpQVlQ3cDVEb19WbEFTNEtYa0pXZERPSi03SDIyS3BEOTYxYXBORW8ydzl5cG8</guid></item><item><title>感冒了？您可能患老年痴呆症的风险更高- Gizmodo | Got Cold Sores?

Research out today has found a link between several infectious diseases, particularly herpes simplex-1 (HSV-1), and a greater risk of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at Gilead Sciences conducted the study, &lt;a href="http://press.psprings.co.uk/Open/may/bmjopen093946.pdf"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in BMJ Open. They analyzed the medical records of Americans with health insurance, finding that people with Alzheimer’s and related conditions were also more likely to be diagnosed with HSV-1. The findings are the latest to suggest that the prevention and treatment of HSV-1 and similar viruses can be an effective measure against dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s is the most common form of &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/getmedia/ef8f48f9-ad36-48ea-87f9-b74034635c1e/alzheimers-facts-and-figures.pdf"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, affecting roughly 7 million Americans today. Most cases are caused by a complex mix of environmental and/or genetic factors. In recent years, many studies have suggested that certain infections—HSV-1 included—can be part of that equation. HSV-1 is the primary cause of oral herpes, commonly known as cold sores, though most infected people will experience few or no symptoms; it can also cause genital herpes (primarily caused by HSV-2).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not every &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187874792300716X?via%3Dihub"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; has supported this viral link, however, so the authors decided to take a look for themselves, with the help of real-world data. According to lead researcher Luke Liu, this is the first study to use a large database of insurance claims in the U.S. to examine the connection between Alzheimer’s and HSV-1.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Liu and his team compared the health outcomes of nearly 400,000 Americans diagnosed with Alzheimer’s to people without Alzheimer’s who were matched in age, sex, and other factors. Only a small percentage of people with Alzheimer’s had a past HSV-1 diagnosis (a bit under 0.5%), but they still had it more often than controls (about 80% more likely).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers then looked at a broader group of people with other forms of dementia related to Alzheimer’s, finding a similar pattern. They additionally found a link between Alzheimer’s and two other herpesviruses, herpes simplex-2 and varicella zoster virus, the cause of chickenpox and shingles. Interestingly, they also found that people who took antiviral treatment for their HSV-1 were less likely to develop Alzheimer’s than people with HSV-1 who didn’t receive treatment (antivirals can suppress and shorten active outbreaks, though not cure the infection).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Observational studies like this one can’t prove a cause-and-effect link between HSV-1 and Alzheimer’s, but the case for such a connection only appears to be getting stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Exposure to herpesviruses is likely to be associated with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementia, and antiherpetic medications can be protective against Alzheimer’s and related dementia,” Liu, a virologist at Gilead, told Gizmodo in an email.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There remain important questions about this association, including the actual mechanisms involved. Some research has suggested our brain’s immune system produces &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273%2818%2930526-9"&gt;amyloid beta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.health.pitt.edu/news/herpes-virus-might-drive-alzheimers-pathology-study-suggests"&gt;tau&lt;/a&gt; to defend against herpesvirus infection, for instance (the misfolded forms of these proteins are the key drivers of Alzheimer’s). But there might be more ways that HSV-1 and similar viruses can set off or accelerate the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Other factors almost certainly play a role, especially since many people contract HSV-1 in their lifetime but never develop Alzheimer’s. Roughly two-thirds of the world’s population under age 50 &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/herpes-simplex-virus"&gt;carries&lt;/a&gt; HSV-1, according to the World Health Organization. The researchers note that the HSV-1/Alzheimer’s link is even stronger in older people, and other research suggests that people carrying the ApoE-ε4 allele—a genetic variant that already increases Alzheimer’s risk—also seem more susceptible to HSV-1 infection. So these viruses are likely one of the many dominos that can fall and eventually lead to Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, the overall evidence does indicate that people can meaningfully lower their dementia risk by treating or preventing certain infections. Several studies have found a link between &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/unique-study-is-latest-to-show-shingles-vaccine-can-prevent-dementia-2000583567"&gt;shingles vaccination and reduced Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;, for instance. Clinical trials testing whether antiviral treatments for herpes can lower dementia risk could be warranted, though Liu notes that kind of research will take considerable resources to get off the ground. Research is also ongoing to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8691362/"&gt;develop vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for HSV-1 and HSV-2—research that might be more worthwhile than currently assumed.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“These findings place an even greater emphasis on viewing the prevention of herpesviruses as a public health priority,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Researchers have learned that the brain’s protective coating of sugars loses some of its heft with age, and that this sugar loss might undermine the brain’s defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobel laureate &lt;a href="https://chemistry.stanford.edu/people/carolyn-bertozzi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Carolyn Bertozzi&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href="https://www.stanford.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;, became curious about this sugary armor and looked into whether replenishing it could tighten the brain’s protective barrier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That barrier, called the blood-brain barrier, is designed to let in necessary &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-foods-with-these-key-nutrients-will-dramatically-slow-brain-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nutrients&lt;/a&gt; while blocking harmful substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shift-in-the-sweet-layer"&gt;Shift in the sweet layer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sugar coat, known as the glycocalyx, sits on cells that form the blood-brain barrier. A recent study in mice found that the glycocalyx becomes thinner over time, leaving gaps that invite unwanted molecules to slip in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re stepping outside for the first time and trying to make sense of what’s out there,” said Carolyn Bertozzi, referencing how little attention sugar molecules have received compared to more commonly studied proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worry is that even minor openings can let inflammatory molecules and other damaging factors spread through the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sitting-for-hours-daily-shrinks-your-brain-even-if-you-exercise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;. Over the long run, that infiltration can potentially &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3114" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diminish memory&lt;/a&gt; and other cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brain-sugar-layers-step-up-the-defense"&gt;Brain sugar layers step up the defense&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists realized that reintroducing key sugar components helped recover some lost protection. These sugar additions seemed to restore the boundary and slow ongoing inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Modulating glycans has a major effect on the brain – both negatively in aging, when these sugars are lost, and positively, when they are restored,” explained lead researcher &lt;a href="https://biox.stanford.edu/people/sophia-shi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sophia Shi&lt;/a&gt;, from Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boosting the supply of specific sugars supported the barrier’s integrity in older mice. That allowed fewer damaging molecules to enter the brain and showed hints of improved brain function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that addressing this sugar gap in the glycocalyx gave the animals a better shot at memory recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-memory-on-the-line"&gt;Memory on the line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work lays the foundation for a new field of inquiry into how the aging brain loses its resilience,” said &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/tony-wyss-coray" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tony Wyss-Coray&lt;/a&gt;, from Stanford University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain tests of learning and recall showed that mice with replenished sugar layers performed better at certain &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-mapping-research-mouse-neurons-revolutionary-advance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; tasks for the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small gains can mean a lot when fighting cognitive decline. Scientists have long searched for fresh ways to help people fend off the forgetfulness that comes with advanced age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that a few sugars can shore up such a crucial brain barrier adds a new angle to that search. Many existing therapies attempt to stop buildup of harmful proteins, so a sugar-based approach is a different track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-could-mean"&gt;What this could mean&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blood-brain barrier poses a challenge for anyone developing medications. This barrier acts as a gatekeeper, but a weakened &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00424-007-0212-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;barrier&lt;/a&gt; also raises red flags, since it might let in bigger trouble. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thicker sugar layer could fine-tune how well the barrier behaves, keeping the brain safe yet still admitting vital substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery might influence how researchers design treatments, especially for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/neuroinflammation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;neuroinflammation&lt;/a&gt; and conditions like Alzheimer’s disease. If a failing sugar shield is a factor in disease progression, adjusting it could help keep the brain in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-identify-the-brain-region-responsible-for-consciousness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;better shape&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-discoveries-lead-next"&gt;Where discoveries lead next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bertozzi, Shi, and their colleagues plan to sort out which sugar types have the most impact. They also aim to figure out how these sugars interact with other protective molecules. The researchers suspect there could be multiple targets for preserving or replenishing the glycocalyx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one is certain exactly how it might work in humans yet, but many age-related vulnerabilities revolve around the same principle of barrier instability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improved knowledge of sugar biology could lead to novel therapies that cross the blood-brain barrier more effectively without causing harmful leaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brain-sugar-health"&gt;Brain sugar health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even for those who are younger, understanding how sugars stabilize the brain’s immune privileges may open up better strategies for warding off disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists suggest that a well-kept glycocalyx might help people recover from infections or injuries involving the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/alzheimers-may-not-be-a-brain-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploring these benefits requires further steps, and many labs are taking a fresh look at the glycocalyx as they learn more about its protective effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research offers a view into how aging brains manage the delicate balance between being open enough for nutrients yet closed off from harmful factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By tuning that balance with added sugars, memory-related symptoms improved in mice. Studies are ongoing to see how much of that success will carry over to human patients, especially those with neurodegenerative conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08589-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 21:19:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxNc0ZKem42b0NMV21FNHJqQ09ETld0UTd4bmh6OEE3dU8xRlZnUXZ3LVJqY0Q4Q3l3Y0dmLVBZbHc3RFdZaFIwa2RHYzBpdXlXUkt3UGd2N0gwSG1Qd1BSLW8wMXkyYXRwQTRocVByUVFtbUM4aGhlY244bjNqdDB1Q2JDT3ZOZFY2ZUFBd0Rua3FrQmhoYnJDbTRFZUZnZ05jV1B0M09zSEhORFBLU1RXcw</guid></item><item><title>与语言相关的色彩知识-视觉大脑回路-神经科学新闻 | Color Knowledge Tied to Language-Visual Brain Circuitry - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE0zLVQzS1F2UXdiRGlJT05wUVVRZmFhbU04Z2VQeW5CUXBVaEQxd0FUVWlnQmZnd2wzSGRMTmZwcTdmWmx3Qnd6R1haYUt0MmFBVVY0a0JUSUZZV1NqQlJCQ2tJMHR2TjJudXdNMk5sQXZfdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study shows that our ability to recall details about familiar objects, like a banana’s typical color, depends on strong connections between visual and language-processing areas of the brain.&lt;/span&gt; Researchers found that stroke patients with disrupted neural pathways between these regions had weaker object-color knowledge and altered brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using fMRI and diffusion imaging, the team showed that the ventral occipitotemporal cortex (VOTC), which processes visual details, works in tandem with language areas like the anterior temporal lobe.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there’s evidence that parts of the brain involved in language, like the dorsal anterior temporal lobe (ATL), are also involved in this process — dementia patients with ATL damage, for example, struggle with object color knowledge, despite having relatively normal visual processing areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand whether communication between the brain’s language and sensory association systems is necessary for representing information about objects, the authors tested whether stroke-induced damage to the neural pathways connecting these two systems impacted patients’ ability to match objects to their typical color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They compared color-identification behavior in 33 stroke patients to 35 demographically-matched controls, using fMRI to record brain activity and diffusion imaging to map the white matter connections between language regions and the VOTC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that stronger connections between language and visual processing regions correlated with stronger object color representations in the VOTC, and supported better performance on object color knowledge tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These effects couldn’t be explained by variations in patients’ stroke lesions, related cognitive processes (like simply recognizing a patch of color), or problems with earlier stages of visual processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors suggest that these results highlight the sophisticated connection between vision and language in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors add, “Our findings reveal that the brain’s ability to store and retrieve object perceptual knowledge—like the color of a banana—relies on critical connections between visual and language systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Damage to these connections disrupts both brain activity and behavior, showing that language isn’t just for communication—it fundamentally shapes how sensory experiences are neurally structured into knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was supported by the STI2030-Major Project (https://en.most.gov.cn/, 2021ZD0204100 (2021ZD0204104) to Y.B.), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (https://www.nsfc.gov.cn/english/site_1/index.html, 31925020 and 82021004 to Y.B., 32171052 to X.S.W., 32071050 to X.Y.W.), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (http://en.moe.gov.cn/, to Y.B.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this language and visual memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2c4e454340434b555c5e495f5f6c5c40435f02435e4b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Claire Turner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://plos.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PLOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Claire Turner – PLOS &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Object knowledge representation in the human visual cortex requires a connection with the language system&lt;/a&gt;” by Yanchao Bi et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Object knowledge representation in the human visual cortex requires a connection with the language system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How world knowledge is stored in the human brain is a central question in cognitive neuroscience.

A large-scale study found that depressive symptoms and loneliness increased long before pain onset, suggesting mental health may play a causal role in later physical discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, adults without pain showed relatively stable emotional well-being over the same period. These findings highlight the importance of early mental health and social support to potentially prevent or delay chronic pain, especially in vulnerable populations with fewer resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Depression and loneliness worsened years before pain began in adults over 50.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unequal Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; The trend was strongest in people with lower income and education levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevention Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Early mental health and social interventions could reduce or delay pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Middle-aged and older adults who experience pain are more likely to have had worsening symptoms of depression up to eight years before the pain began, according to a new study by UCL (University College London) researchers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;eClinicalMedicine&lt;/em&gt;, suggests that among this age group, treatment for depression might help to prevent or reduce later aches and pains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared survey data from 3,668 adults aged over 50 who often experienced moderate to severe pain with a matched group of the same number who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110196"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two heads and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers also investigated if there was a link between social isolation and experiences of pain but, unlike with loneliness, found little difference in social isolation between the pain and non-pain groups. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the pain group, they found that depressive symptoms got rapidly worse in the eight years prior to pain, peaked at the onset of pain, and remained high in the years after, whereas in the non-pain group depressive symptoms were less severe, less prevalent, and relatively constant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found a similar trend for loneliness, which increased both in the years before and years after the onset of pain but stayed low and relatively constant for those in the non-pain group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the cause of the pain was not identified, most participants said they had pain in the back, knee, hip, or foot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Dr Mikaela Bloomberg (UCL Epidemiology &amp;amp; Public Health) said: “Pain and depression are known to be linked, with each exacerbating the other. But we don’t know about the timing of these related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study shows that depressive symptoms and loneliness worsen long before pain begins. This is important as it suggests the potential for early mental health and social support to reduce or delay later pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Factors such as depression and loneliness can contribute to pain through several mechanisms. By inducing stress, they may increase inflammation, which can lead to pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They also may increase sensitivity to pain by changing immune responses and by dysregulating our autonomic nervous system, the network of nerves that control unconscious processes such as the ‘flight or fight’ response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings highlight the importance of approaching pain not just from a biological perspective. Mental health interventions may be important too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study used data covering 21 years from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), in which a nationally representative population sample in England answers a wide range of questions every two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team found that the sharp increase in depressive symptoms among participants who experienced pain was larger among people with less education and wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is likely in part, the researchers said, because these individuals had fewer resources to support mental health and pain management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team said this finding pointed to the need to prioritise vulnerable populations with fewer socioeconomic resources with accessible mental health and community support programmes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also investigated if there was a link between social isolation and experiences of pain but, unlike with loneliness, found little difference in social isolation between the pain and non-pain groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas loneliness is a subjective feeling of lacking social connections, social isolation indicates objective lack of contact with friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team suggested that the quality of relationships, rather than the quantity of relationships or levels of social interaction, may matter in terms of mitigating against pain and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three quarters of the study participants in the pain group reported experiencing pain in the back, knee, hip, or foot. Of those remaining, 1.9% reported pain all over, 0.5% reported mouth or tooth pain, and 20.7% reported pain elsewhere.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among study limitations, the research team noted that the participants were overwhelmingly white, reflecting the population of England in that age group. Future research, they said, should determine whether results are similar for younger groups and those with more racial and ethnic diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They cautioned that the survey data did not distinguish between pain and chronic pain. However, they had consistent results when they restricted the analysis to participants who reported pain in successive surveys two years apart, suggesting the findings applied to chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team adjusted for a wide range of factors that may have skewed the results – including participant sex, age, birth year, education, wealth, long term health conditions, physical activity level, alcohol consumption and smoking status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The researchers received funding from the Nuffield Foundation’s Oliver Bird Fund and Versus Arthritis.

We examined trajectories of these outcomes before and after pain onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analysed data from participants aged ≥50 years from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). Data collection began in 2002 (wave 1) and was repeated biennially until 2019 (wave 9); wave 10 took place in 2021/23. Participants who had data from at least 2 waves were included. Participants reporting pain between 2002 and 2023 (‘pain group’) were matched with an equivalent number without pain (‘no-pain group’; N = 7336 total).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychosocial outcomes were also assessed at each wave: Loneliness using the three-item subscale from the revised UCLA loneliness scale; social isolation using a score ranging from 0 to 5, with a higher score indicating more severe social isolation; and depression using the 8-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Piecewise linear mixed models were used to produce trajectories of loneliness, social isolation, and depressive symptom scores before and after pain onset and during the comparable time period in the no-pain group. Subgroup analyses examined how results differed by age, sex, education, and wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loneliness and depressive symptoms were more severe for the pain group than the no-pain group before pain onset (e.g., difference [pain-no pain] eight years before pain onset = 0.19 points, 95% confidence interval = 0.11–0.28 for loneliness; difference = 0.14, 0.06–0.22 for depressive symptoms). For loneliness, this difference increased consistently during the study period (e.g., difference = 0.33, 0.26–0.40 eight years after pain onset).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For depressive symptoms, the difference increased sharply to 0.58 (0.52–0.65) at pain onset and remained stable thereafter. Differences in depressive symptoms were most pronounced in less educated and less wealthy participants. There were negligible differences between pain and no-pain groups for social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loneliness and depressive symptoms progressively increased in severity years before pain onset.

After leaving the hospital, participants wore movement trackers on their wrists for 30 days. Researchers then followed up a year later to see if additional cardiac events or death occurred. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that those who replaced 30 minutes of sedentary behavior with 30 minutes of light movement of any kind, such as a slow walk or house chores, had a 50% lower chance of having a second heart attack or cardiac event. When folks replaced 30 minutes of sedentary behavior with moderate or vigorous exercise, like a jog or bike ride, their chance of a second heart attack or cardiac event dropped by 61%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;One surprising find? Those who replaced sedentary behavior with 30 minutes of &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/sleep-wellness" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="sleep" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6827913ae4b0a2fcab729e7f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/life/topic/sleep-wellness" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; had a 14% lower chance of having a second heart attack or cardiac event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, you have options here.

Why is it good?’” Diaz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And it’s just considered to be a separate entity. It’s a healthful restorative behavior,” Diaz said. “It’s really helpful for things like inflammation and just recovery of your body at the end of the day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting up and moving around is key for better heart health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to people who averaged fewer than 12 sedentary hours each day (not including sleep), folks who averaged more than 15 sedentary hours per day were 2.5 times more likely to have a cardiac event or die during the study’s one-year follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the important and actionable take-home message is [that]&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;sedentary behavior is deleterious. It’s bad for your health after a cardiac event,” said &lt;a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/sandeep-nathan" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Sandeep Nathan" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6827913ae4b0a2fcab729e7f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/sandeep-nathan" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Dr. Sandeep Nathan&lt;/a&gt;, the medical director of the cardiac intensive care unit and co-director of the cardiac catheterization laboratory at the University of Chicago Medicine’s Heart and Vascular Center. Nathan is not affiliated with the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are limitations to this study. “These were patients who presented with ... acute coronary syndrome symptoms, but only about 25% of these patients actually had a solid diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome,” said Nathan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, not everyone in this study actually had a heart attack; some just went to the emergency room for heart attack symptoms, like chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But it doesn’t diminish the importance of the primary finding, which is that in anybody who comes in with a constellation of symptoms suggesting that they have heart disease, they do better with physical activity,” added Nathan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also did not consider where study participants lived or their income, which are two factors that can also impact heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Tatiana Maksimova via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Tatiana Maksimova via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Moderate to vigorous exercise, such as swimming, running or cycling, can lower your risk of a second heart attack.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical activity has a range of benefits for heart health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study underscored a well-established notion: Physical activity of any kind is good for your heart. Overall, it improves your physical and cardiovascular conditioning, Nathan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderate to vigorous exercise also helps control the factors that put you at risk of a heart attack or coronary event, said Nathan. It “decreases blood sugar levels, it decreases blood pressure. It perhaps helps you lose weight and improve your lipid profiles as well, and all of those are independent risk factors for a second cardiac event,” Nathan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And then finally, what I always tell patients is that if you’re consistently maintaining a high level of physical activity, you have a warning system. You can tell me that, ‘Doc, I normally go 30 minutes on the treadmill, but for the past couple of weeks, I hit the 15-minute mark and I just don’t feel well,’” said Nathan. “That’s an early indicator that something’s amiss, right?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you live a sedentary life, you can’t test your heart health the same way. In other words, changes to what you’re able to do in your regular fitness regimen can help indicate if you’re developing blockages or issues that could cause a second heart attack, said Nathan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardiac rehab is also a great tool for lowering your risk of a second heart attack.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that avoiding sedentary behavior is good for your cardiovascular health and your overall health. Beyond that, though, Nathan said it’s important for those who do have a heart attack to go to (and complete) cardiac rehab as prescribed, as it can help you from having a second heart attack or other cardiac event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And so, when I counsel patients after a heart attack, I point that out to them,” Nathan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You may think that you can do this on your own, in your home gym, or in your basement, or your local fitness facility, but there is a substantial benefit to actually going to cardiac rehab and being pushed to engage in escalating intensity of activity for a period of about 12 weeks, typically,” Nathan noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

Most people have no symptoms, but the disease can put infants and people with weakened immune systems at risk for severe illness that can be chronic or deadly if untreated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For the study, published last week in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a team led by researchers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) examined the suspected histoplasmosis cluster affecting the family members, who lived in Georgia, Texas, and Washington state, in December 2024 and January 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Travel details raised suspicion &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As part of a 7-day vacation, on December 24, 12 of 13 family members in the travel group toured Venado Caves, a popular tourist destination in Alajuela province, in the north-central part of Costa Rica near Nicaragua's southern border. Six family members were aged 42 to 49 years, and six were aged 8 to 16.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All reported seeing bats and coming into contact with bat droppings while crawling through tight spaces during the 2-hour tour and became mildly or moderately sick after returning to the United States 8 to 19 days after the visit. Five adults and one child sought treatment at an urgent care or primary care center after experiencing symptoms but didn't mention any travel. The family member who didn't tour the cave didn't become ill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Signs and symptoms included headache, malaise, fever, night sweats, muscle pain, and respiratory and gastrointestinal problems. No other activities reported before, during, or after the trip were tied to risk factors for exposure to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Histoplasma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; species. Four family members were tested for fungal antigens, with two of them positive for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Histoplasma capsulatum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; species complex. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Three patients received antibiotics, two were given corticosteroids, and one received a cough suppressant. One adult was referred to an emergency department and hospitalized because of abnormal chest radiographic findings that raised concerns about lung cancer. That patient was given antifungal medication.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the day after admission, healthcare providers who asked if the patient had recently traveled learned of the cave visit and began to suspect histoplasmosis. On January 17, a Georgia infectious disease physician notified the CDC of the cases. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The cave was associated with a histoplasmosis &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ajtmh.org/view/journals/tpmd/70/4/article-p438.xml"&gt;&lt;span&gt;outbreak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in 1998 and 1999 that sickened 51 people. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;All patients improved within a month&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On January 21, 2025, the CDC launched a multistate investigation of the 12 cases with the Georgia Department of Public Health, the Texas Department of State Health Services, and the Washington State Department of Health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Antigen testing for all four patients occurred within 1 month of symptom onset, the optimal time frame," the researchers noted. "However, because antigen detection sensitivity for histoplasmosis is lower in patients with mild disease who are immunocompetent, the negative test results might have been false negatives."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One patient with a positive test result also twice received positive complement fixation antibody test results. In addition to the patient with radiographic findings suspicious for lung cancer, another patient also had abnormal radiographic results characterized by pulmonary nodules and opacities consistent with histoplasmosis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, because antigen detection sensitivity for histoplasmosis is lower in patients with mild disease who are immunocompetent, the negative test results might have been false negatives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The ill family members were classified as having confirmed (1 patient), probable (8), or suspected (3) histoplasmosis based on the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists case definition. By day 28 post-exposure, all affected family members had recovered or were getting better, which the study authors said is consistent with mild or moderate histoplasmosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Antibiotics, corticosteroids not recommended&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The CDC alerted health departments through an Epidemic Information Exchange notification to identify additional histoplasmosis cases and is working with the US Embassy in Costa Rica and the Costa Rica Ministry of Health to add information about histoplasmosis risks into the Venado Caves tour waiver forms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Currently, the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://cavernasdelvenado.com/en/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;website&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for the Venado Caves tour, which prominently features photos of bats, says that the cave is home to a colony of bats and that guests will be given a mask of an unspecified type but doesn't mention histoplasmosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On March 18, the US Embassy issued a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://cr.usembassy.gov/health-alert-histoplasmosis-risks-from-caving-activities-march-18-2025/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;health alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to notify the public of the risk of contracting histoplasmosis from caving. Exposures to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;H capsulatum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; at Venado Caves could be ongoing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Antibiotic (i.e., antibacterial) medications are ineffective, and corticosteroids might worsen fungal infections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Histoplasmosis diagnoses are often delayed, and treatment guidelines recommend antifungal drugs for only severe histoplasmosis. "Antibiotic (i.e., antibacterial) medications are ineffective, and corticosteroids might worsen fungal infections; prescription of these medications to certain affected family members suggests that fungal infections were not initially considered as the cause of the illness," the researchers wrote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Clinicians should consider fungal illness in the differential diagnosis of patients with constitutional or pulmonary signs or symptoms after recent caving or other activities associated with risk for histoplasmosis and should report suspected cases of histoplasmosis to local health departments as applicable," they concluded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

His work is motivated in part by what happened to a police officer he treated in 2002, just after completing his medical training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The man arrived at the emergency room unconscious, in a coma. He had been in a terrible car crash while pursuing a criminal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Two days later, Dr. Manley’s mentor said it was time to tell the man’s family there was no hope. His life support should be withdrawn. He should be allowed to die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Dr. Manley resisted. The patient’s brain oxygen levels were encouraging. Seven days later the policeman was still in a coma. Dr. Manley’s mentor again pressed him to talk to the man’s family about withdrawing life support. Again, Dr. Manley resisted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Ten days after the accident, the policeman began to come out of his coma. Three years later he was back at work and was named San Francisco Police Officer of the Month. In 2010, he was Police Officer of the Year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“That case, and another like it,” Dr. Manley said, “changed my practice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But little has changed in the world of traumatic brain injuries since Dr. Manley’s patient woke up. Assessments of who will recover and how severely patients are injured are pretty much the same, which results in patients being told they “just” have a concussion, who then have trouble getting care for recurring symptoms like memory lapses or headaches. And it results in some patients in the position of that policemen, who have their life support withdrawn when they might have recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurine"&gt;Taurine&lt;/a&gt; is an amino acid occurring naturally in the body, and found in energy drinks as well as foods like fish and meat – and while it has certain &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/taurine/faq-20058177"&gt;benefits for the body&lt;/a&gt;, a new study suggests it's also an important fuel source for driving cancers such as leukemia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by a team from the University of Rochester Medical Center (UR Medicine), the study analyzed the behavior of leukemia cells, finding that they could borrow taurine from the surrounding bone marrow and use it to grow more quickly. It gives these cells a growth jolt, similar to how we might get an alertness jolt from an energy drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the researchers blocked taurine access in mouse models and transplanted leukemia cells from humans or mice,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="161782" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; growth was suppressed. This suggests that targeting taurine could help in treatments for some cancer types, such as leukemia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Local levels of taurine in bone marrow may enhance leukemia growth, suggesting caution in use of high-dose taurine supplementation," &lt;a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/a-downside-of-taurine-it-drives-leukemia-growth"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; oncologist Jane Liesveld, from UR Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's that supplementation, through sources such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/electrolyte-drinks-can-make-things-worse-when-youre-sick-heres-why"&gt;energy drinks&lt;/a&gt;, that the researchers are worried about. It's still early days in terms of joining these dots, but giving the body extra taurine might not be the best idea for stopping cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, further investigation into how this all works is going to be needed. It's not clear yet how this might work in humans, or how additional taurine outside of bone marrow might have an impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BlaeEUNOHJI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With different cancers though, there's a different context. Taurine is also known to boost the immune system in certain ways, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.03.011"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown this can help to fight off gastric cancers in the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding more about the metabolism of cancers, and how they survive and thrive, is an increasingly significant part of cancer research. We know that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-how-major-cancer-causing-mutation-triggers-disease"&gt;genetic mutations&lt;/a&gt; can lead to cancers growing out of control, but it's not the only trick the disease has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161786" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161786" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/TaurineCells.jpg" alt="Cancer cells analysis" class="wp-image-161786 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/TaurineCells.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/TaurineCells-600x305.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161786" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at how cancer cells grew with and without taurine. (Sharma et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer, and we are at the very beginning of understanding metabolic effects on leukemia cells," &lt;a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/a-downside-of-taurine-it-drives-leukemia-growth"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Liesveld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The prior focus has been on genetic changes, but the focus is expanding to understanding how leukemia cells are able to hijack various metabolic pathways for their own survival."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While energy drinks undoubtedly work as advertised – giving you a brief burst of energy – there are growing concerns around the health risks of these drinks, which have been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-energy-drink-could-increase-risk-of-heart-disease-experts-warn"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mixing-energy-drinks-with-alcohol-can-impair-brain-function-study-in-rats-shows"&gt;impaired cognition&lt;/a&gt; in previous studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's possible that cancer risks might be added to that list of potential downsides, although the high sugar and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="161782" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; content is probably a more pressing health concern than taurine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more significant about these discoveries is that cancer cells could be stopped by cutting off their energy diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"&gt;Myeloid cancers&lt;/a&gt; such as leukemia interfere with the normal functioning of blood cells, and they can be fast-moving and difficult to treat. Anything we can do to slow them down is likely to improve recovery rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are very excited about these studies because they demonstrate that targeting uptake by myeloid leukemia cells may be a possible new avenue for treatment of these aggressive diseases," &lt;a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/a-downside-of-taurine-it-drives-leukemia-growth"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="161782" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cell&lt;/a&gt; and cancer biologist Jeevisha Bajaj, from UR Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Our current data suggest that it would be helpful to develop stable and effective ways to block taurine from entering leukemia cells."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09018-7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;A Kyle resident tested positive for measles but is no longer infectious, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;" To my recollection, we have never had a true case of measles,"  Ian Harris, epidemiologist with the Hays County Health Department, said at a press conference Tuesday. "Never had a confirmed positive to my knowledge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials with the Hays County Health Department said the individual received care and is feeling better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hays County Health Department said it is working on identifying and notifying people who may have been exposed to the infected person when they were contagious from May 11 to 19.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;" This individual was not capable of providing us valid proof that they were immunized, so right now we are considering them unvaccinated," said Matthew Gonzales, the director for the Hays County Health Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gonzales said the person is an adult and was exposed to the virus through an extended family member who visited them. At this time, the department can't confirm if the family member had measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The county shared a list of dates and locations where the person may have exposed others to the virus:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kohls - Sephora, 20185 Marketplace Ave, Saturday, May 10, 8 a.m. - 6 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;H-E-B Plus, 5401 Farm to Market 1626, Saturday, May 10, 8 a.m. - 6 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CommuniCare - Kyle Clinic, 2810 Dacy Lane, Tuesday, May 13, 11:47 a.m. - 2:23 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Texas Department of Public Safety, 1400 N IH 35, Tuesday, May 13, 8 a.m. - 1 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ascension Seton Hays, 6001 Kyle Parkway, Friday, May 16, 12:50 p.m. - 5:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person wasn't considered infectious on May 10, but the county said it was listing those locations "out of an abundance of caution due to the small possibility of early transmission."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local health officials are advising people who were at the above locations during those time frames to check their medical records to see if they are protected against measles. They should also monitor for symptoms, which include fever, rash, cough, runny nose and watery eyes. People who are pregnant, have an infant or are immunocompromised should contact their health care provider for next steps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decline of vaccination rates in West Texas have led to a &lt;a href="https://www.kut.org/health/2025-04-08/texas-measles-outbreak-isnt-slowing-down-how-can-that-change" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt;, with cases popping up elsewhere in the state, including &lt;a href="https://www.kut.org/health/2025-02-28/austin-tx-measles-case-unvaccinated-vaccine" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;Central Texas.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hayscountytx.gov/possible-measles-exposure-in-san-marcos" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;In February&lt;/a&gt;, the Hays County Health Department was notified about a visitor from Gaines County who tested positive for measles and took a tour of Texas State University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this time, Hays County officials don't believe the current case of measles is connected to the outbreak in Gaines County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious virus that is especially dangerous for young children and people with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms usually begin &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;7 to 14 days after infection&lt;/a&gt; and can first appear as flu-like symptoms. A measles rash appears three to five days after symptoms begin. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span class="tag-term"&gt;News Release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2025-05-20T14:00:00-04:00" class="date-display-single"&gt;Tuesday, May 20, 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;NIH researchers develop biomarker score for predicting diets high in ultra-processed foods&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;
 Poly-metabolite scores could reduce reliance on self-reported dietary data in large population studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) identified patterns of metabolites in blood and urine that can be used as an objective measure of an individual’s consumption of energy from ultra-processed foods. Metabolites are left after the body converts food into energy, a process known as metabolism. Scientists used these data to develop a score based on multiple metabolites, known as a poly-metabolite score, that has the potential to reduce the reliance on, or complement the use of, self-reported dietary data in large population studies. The findings appeared May 20, 2025, in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Limitations of self-reported diet are well known. Metabolomics provides an exciting opportunity to not only improve our methods for objectively measuring complex exposures like diet and intake of ultra-processed foods, but also to understand the mechanisms by which diet might be impacting health,” said lead investigator Erikka Loftfield, Ph.D., M.P.H., of NIH’s National Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diets high in ultra-processed foods, which are defined as ready-to-eat or ready-to-heat, industrially manufactured products, typically high in calories and low in essential nutrients, have been linked to increased risk of obesity and related chronic diseases, including some types of cancer. Large population studies quantifying the health effects of ultraprocessed foods typically rely on self-reported data from dietary questionnaires. Such measures may be subject to differences in reporting and may not account for changes in the food supply over time. As a result of this study, researchers now have an objective measure of ultra-processed food intake to help advance the study of associations between ultra-processed foods and health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the researchers used data from several existing studies to identify metabolites and patterns of metabolites in blood and urine that were related to ultra-processed food intake. Observational data came from 718 older adults who provided biospecimens and dietary information over a 12-month study period. Experimental data came from a small clinical trial of 20 adults at the NIH Clinical Center who consumed a diet high in ultraprocessed foods (80% of energy) and a diet comprised of no ultraprocessed food (0% of energy) for two weeks each in random order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers found hundreds of metabolites that correlated with the percentage of energy from ultra-processed foods in the diet. Using machine learning, researchers identified metabolic patterns associated with high intake of ultra-processed foods and calculated poly-metabolite scores for blood and urine separately. Additional tests found that these scores could accurately differentiate within trial subjects between the highly processed diet phase and the unprocessed diet phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Study participants were older U.S. adults whose diets may vary from other populations, as a result, findings will need to be replicated in other age groups. Researchers recommended that these poly-metabolite scores be evaluated and improved in populations with different diets and a wide range of ultra-processed food intake. Additionally, future research should examine the association of these poly-metabolite scores and the risk of diseases such as cancer and type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

You can use it in salads and slaws, but you can also use it as a wrap for tacos, sandwiches and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Fatty fish&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fish delivers protein, and when you choose a fatty fish like tuna, salmon or trout, you're also getting omega-3 fatty acids. &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/omega-3s-may-offer-heart-and-hearing-benefits/" target="_self"&gt;Omega-3 fats&lt;/a&gt; may help reduce fat levels (triglycerides) in the blood and may also lower blood pressure, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/content/7-kidney-friendly-superfoods" target="_self"&gt;National Kidney Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have CKD, you may need to keep an eye on the phosphorus and potassium levels of the fish you choose. The National Kidney Foundation has &lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/fish" target="_self"&gt;a chart you can use&lt;/a&gt; to determine levels in specific types of fish.

They deliver antioxidants too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can slice them and eat them with dips or roast them and add them to dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Cranberries&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cranberries &lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/news/keephealthy/newsletter/FallWinter2013/KH_Cranberry-Kidney-Connection" target="_self"&gt;help to prevent&lt;/a&gt; urinary tract infections. These usually stay in your bladder, they can travel up to your kidney, making kidney problems worse. Fortunately, regularly consuming cranberries can help you avoid this unwelcome situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/benefits-of-cranberries/" target="_self"&gt;cranberries&lt;/a&gt; have antioxidants that can help fight inflammation, and they can boost your heart and digestive health. It turns out, these tart berries aren't just for the Thanksgiving table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Blueberries&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've talked about some of the best foods for kidneys, but you can take it a step further. The question is: What &lt;a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/what_foods_help_repair_kidneys/article.htm" target="_self"&gt;foods help repair kidneys&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/benefits-of-blueberries/" target="_self"&gt;Blueberries&lt;/a&gt; deliver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With high levels of antioxidants and loads of &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/why-you-need-vitamin-c-for-immune-support-and-how-to-get-enough/" target="_self"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt; and fiber, blueberries are all-around healthy. They can also help to reduce inflammation and support bone health, reversing some of the issues that can come with CKD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Dark, leafy greens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of reasons to turn to dark, leafy greens like spinach or kale. They deliver so many nutrients that they can help you get &lt;a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/plains-area/gfnd/gfhnrc/docs/news-articles/2013/dark-green-leafy-vegetables#:~:text=Dark%20green%20leafy%20vegetables%20are,many%20of%20the%20B%2Dvitamins." target="_self"&gt;key vitamins and minerals&lt;/a&gt;, plus immunity-boosting benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be advised that greens can come with a decent amount of potassium. If you have CKD, talk to your doctor before adding more of these to your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. Olive oil&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich in antioxidants and healthy fatty acids, olive oil can boost your overall wellness. &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/is-extra-virgin-olive-oil-extra-healthy" target="_self"&gt;A study from Harvard University&lt;/a&gt; found that olive oil may lower cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia and some types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond all this, it can help you add flavor to dishes without turning to salt or butter. To get more antioxidants, choose unrefined or cold-pressed olive oil that's virgin or extra virgin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. Garlic&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another antioxidant-rich, inflammation-fighting food, garlic also contains a specific compound called allicin. For &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5618629/" target="_self"&gt;people with CKD&lt;/a&gt;, allicin — an active compound found in garlic — worked just as effectively to help protect kidney health as a prescription drug. If you're looking for the best foods for your kidneys, garlic has to make the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, it's an excellent way to add flavor when you're skimping on salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9. Onions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the same family as garlic, &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-onions" target="_self"&gt;onions&lt;/a&gt; give you another excellent and salt-free way to add flavor (bonus points if you saute them in olive oil). Onions also deliver important nutrients like vitamins B6 and C, manganese and copper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also contain quercetin, a chemical that can help your body fight cancer, and organic sulfur compounds that can reduce your risk of high blood pressure, stroke and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10. Cauliflower&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/282844" target="_self"&gt;Cauliflower&lt;/a&gt; brings the crunch, paired with plenty of vitamins C, B6, B9 and K, along with fiber. It also contains compounds your body can use to neutralize certain toxins, a big help when your kidneys aren't doing their best filtration work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cauliflower does contain some potassium and phosphorus, though, so while it makes the list of foods good for kidneys, people with CKD may want to moderate their intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;11. Egg whites&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/programs/core-kidney/patient-resources/eating-healthy" target="_self"&gt;Egg whites&lt;/a&gt; are specifically recommended for people with kidney problems. They give you a way to increase your protein levels -- which can be important with later-stage CKD, especially if you're on dialysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;12. Arugula&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/benefits-arugula" target="_self"&gt;Arugula&lt;/a&gt; is packed with nutrients your body needs like magnesium, iron, calcium and vitamins A, B9, C and K. Plus, it's antioxidant-rich and has glucosinolates, which can help your body protect itself against a range of cancer types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can eat arugula raw (it's a great salad base), but you can also sprinkle it over whatever you're whipping up. It's great on pizzas, in omelets and with pasta, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;13. Apples&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apples deliver the cancer-fighting quercetin and fiber that can help to keep your cholesterol and blood sugar at healthy levels. They've got plenty of antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better yet, they're easy to work into your diet. Leave a bowl of apples on your counter and you'll have a kidney-healthy, grab-and-go snack whenever you need one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 17:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxQLXdwMEw1b2x4NjZ3d3BZM2xjR3lMLWRCTHJPdDd2Q2Y1anhrMDRMRWJjV3lkdWNYR2NJTWhvZjFJZmQ1Tm1SQ3NKVm42Y19ZVE0wa2ZEZDl1YldIMjVoZG8yWlhmRGY5a2ZMd044Ri1aV01QdXpUS3JSeHpfX3VuUGlhS0pTQXM</guid></item><item><title>人体自身的大麻素可能有助于控制与创伤相关的恐惧-神经科学新闻 | Body’s Own Cannabinoids May Help Control Trauma-Linked Fear - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE1sNDRiVHJBY2RTblN4Q2h4SkNrdVd0U1EwTXF6U3czaWZIX2pCMHp5RGkzRzBOUjBVZDlneDNQSDBwc00tUFctOHRWcGY0MHVtMEdxUlBXV0JyQklGUmRaTDhmaldqZHNMVHAzTVNB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study reveals that a natural cannabinoid in the body, 2-AG, plays a crucial role in regulating fear responses, particularly in individuals with PTSD and anxiety. Researchers found that lower levels of 2-AG in both mice and humans were linked to exaggerated or overgeneralized fear reactions to non-threatening stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that 2-AG helps the brain distinguish real threats from harmless cues, acting as a natural filter for fear. By targeting this endocannabinoid system, scientists believe it may be possible to develop new, more effective treatments for anxiety-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear Filter:&lt;/strong&gt; The endocannabinoid 2-AG helps suppress excessive or generalized fear responses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-Species Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Lower 2-AG levels were associated with heightened fear in both mice and humans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Target:&lt;/strong&gt; 2-AG may be a promising target for new anxiety and PTSD treatments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific cannabinoids produced by the human body may help to quell excessive fear responses in people with post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety, according to a Northwestern Medicine-led study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Investigation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety often experience inappropriate fear responses to stimuli that may or may not be similar to those experienced during their original trauma, said Luis Rosas-Vidal, MD, PhD, assistant professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The endocannabinoid system – which engages the same receptors as marijuana – in your body regulates neurotransmitters release,” Rosas-Vidal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110187"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/2-ag-endocannabinoid-PTSD-neuroscince.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/2-ag-endocannabinoid-PTSD-neuroscince-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/2-ag-endocannabinoid-PTSD-neuroscince-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/2-ag-endocannabinoid-PTSD-neuroscince-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/2-ag-endocannabinoid-PTSD-neuroscince-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/2-ag-endocannabinoid-PTSD-neuroscince-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/2-ag-endocannabinoid-PTSD-neuroscince-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/2-ag-endocannabinoid-PTSD-neuroscince.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/2-ag-endocannabinoid-PTSD-neuroscince.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/2-ag-endocannabinoid-PTSD-neuroscince-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/2-ag-endocannabinoid-PTSD-neuroscince-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/2-ag-endocannabinoid-PTSD-neuroscince-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/2-ag-endocannabinoid-PTSD-neuroscince-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/2-ag-endocannabinoid-PTSD-neuroscince-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/2-ag-endocannabinoid-PTSD-neuroscince-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Together, the findings highlight the key role endocannabinoids play in regulating fear responses, Rosas-Vidal said, and identify 2-AG as a potential target for anxiety therapies. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Specifically, the one we’re interested in, 2-AG, have been implicated in regulating fear responses and anxiety responses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However,  if and exactly how the cannabinoid 2-AG (2-arachidonoylglycerol) functions at the neuronal level to filter fear responses when exposed to new stimuli has previously been unclear, Rosas-Vidal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, scientists examined fear responses in mice that had depleted levels of 2-AG. They found that mice with 2-AG inhibition displayed increased fear responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using fiber photometry approaches, investigators found that higher fear generalization was associated with lower endocannabinoid activity in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that blocking the endocannabinoid 2-AG basically leads to over-generalization of their fear responses,” said Rosas-Vidal, who is also a member of the Stephen M. Stahl Center for Psychiatric Neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senior author of the study was Sachin Patel, MD, PhD, the chair and Lizzie Gilman Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with investigators at University of Calgary and Linköping University,  the investigators observed how 2-AG levels in blood relate to fear generalization in human research participants. Similarly, they found that lower 2-AG levels were associated with higher fear generalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the findings highlight the key role endocannabinoids play in regulating fear responses, Rosas-Vidal said, and identify 2-AG as a potential target for anxiety therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think that our findings are really exciting,” he said. “They show both at the mechanistic and behavioral level how 2-AG is regulating fear responses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, Rosas-Vidal and his collaborators will continue to study cannabinoid signaling in different neuron subtypes and the mechanisms mediating generalization, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe these sorts of studies are very vital in psychiatry to give us understanding of how psychiatric disorders arise and also point to potential treatments in the future,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health grants K08MH126166 and R01MH107435.

The endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) is crucial for modulating anxiety, fear, and stress adaptation but its role in balancing fear discrimination versus generalization is not known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this, we used a combination of plasma endocannabinoid measurement and neuroimaging from a childhood maltreatment-exposed and non-exposed mixed population combined with human and rodent fear conditioning models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show that 2-AG levels are inversely associated with fear generalization at the behavioral level in both mice and humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice, 2-AG depletion increases the proportion of neurons, and the similarity between neuronal representations, of threat-predictive and neutral stimuli within prelimbic prefrontal cortex neuronal ensembles. In humans, increased dorsolateral prefrontal cortical-amygdala resting state connectivity is inversely correlated with fear generalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These data provide convergent cross-species evidence that 2-AG is a key regulator of fear generalization and further support the notion that 2-AG deficiency could represent a trauma-related disorder susceptibility endophenotype.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 16:54:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE1sNDRiVHJBY2RTblN4Q2h4SkNrdVd0U1EwTXF6U3czaWZIX2pCMHp5RGkzRzBOUjBVZDlneDNQSDBwc00tUFctOHRWcGY0MHVtMEdxUlBXV0JyQklGUmRaTDhmaldqZHNMVHAzTVNB</guid></item><item><title>世卫组织称在巴布亚新几内亚检测到疫苗衍生的脊髓灰质炎病毒-路透社 | WHO says vaccine-derived poliovirus detected in Papua New Guinea - Reuters</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizgFBVV95cUxPT2lJbk1zYnZUNUI5YmNYLVhDWkFDYUcybnFaTEF1SnRScFQ5ME9PYU9CQ00zUVM2QUN2RjBOOHgwM1p3SjZGRGN4TndVdFdMN0E0Mjh3a2FPV0pPbXJWMEhoVjBTUmlMZXZBRFhjM3pKY1F1QUxGS1ptUGpPdlc5VTJSUFRaSzVzaUl1VWItZjBUWF9zUlp4S0VVUFJVSWVBQm5LMnRTQTJGQTc2SmYwSVVRd1dOOHAyWkZHZ3BGRzg5SXYtaTFadVhOcmY5UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 16:52:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizgFBVV95cUxPT2lJbk1zYnZUNUI5YmNYLVhDWkFDYUcybnFaTEF1SnRScFQ5ME9PYU9CQ00zUVM2QUN2RjBOOHgwM1p3SjZGRGN4TndVdFdMN0E0Mjh3a2FPV0pPbXJWMEhoVjBTUmlMZXZBRFhjM3pKY1F1QUxGS1ptUGpPdlc5VTJSUFRaSzVzaUl1VWItZjBUWF9zUlp4S0VVUFJVSWVBQm5LMnRTQTJGQTc2SmYwSVVRd1dOOHAyWkZHZ3BGRzg5SXYtaTFadVhOcmY5UQ</guid></item><item><title>大脑的守门人记住信号来塑造长期记忆-神经科学新闻 | Brain’s Gatekeepers Remember Signals to Shape Long-Term Memory - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE9XdUZ1d3ppWGttSm8xNGR4WlJUMTVFdVNUU25vTlMwMXNOWDNmQWlmMmpEQjN2ZkIyMkVDbXZPeWtybDVSZkxWZVgtZXo4SG1ZM1lqQnZ4dW9MZlpJc0twNGcyMVNuWERON3FBdEF0clk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study reveals how calcium ion channels in the brain don’t just relay signals—they remember them. Researchers discovered that CaV2.1 channels at synapses can adopt nearly 200 shapes based on electrical activity, effectively entering a “memory state” that weakens signal transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These brief molecular memories accumulate over time, leading to long-term synaptic changes essential for learning and memory formation.

These vital processes depend on the reshaping of connections between neurons in the brain. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nerve junctions, called synapses, are strengthened or weakened throughout life in such a way that the brain is, in a certain sense, constantly being reshaped at the cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon is called synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110183"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/memory-synapses-gatekeeper-neurosciecnce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/memory-synapses-gatekeeper-neurosciecnce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/memory-synapses-gatekeeper-neurosciecnce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/memory-synapses-gatekeeper-neurosciecnce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/memory-synapses-gatekeeper-neurosciecnce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/memory-synapses-gatekeeper-neurosciecnce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/memory-synapses-gatekeeper-neurosciecnce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/memory-synapses-gatekeeper-neurosciecnce.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/memory-synapses-gatekeeper-neurosciecnce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/memory-synapses-gatekeeper-neurosciecnce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/memory-synapses-gatekeeper-neurosciecnce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/memory-synapses-gatekeeper-neurosciecnce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/memory-synapses-gatekeeper-neurosciecnce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/memory-synapses-gatekeeper-neurosciecnce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/memory-synapses-gatekeeper-neurosciecnce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The focus of this study was on a specific type of ion channel, the CaV2.1 channel, which is the most common calcium ion channel in the brain. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several processes contributing to synaptic plasticity in the nervous system. One of these processes has to do with a type of molecules called calcium ion channels, which have long been of interest to researchers at Linköping University (LiU).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I want to uncover the secret lives of these ion channel molecules. Calcium ion channels have very important functions in the body – by opening and closing, they regulate, among other things, nerve-to-nerve signalling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But beyond that, these molecules also have a kind of memory of their own, and can remember previous nerve signals,” says Antonios Pantazis, associate professor at the Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences at LiU, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus of this study was on a specific type of ion channel, the CaV2.1 channel, which is the most common calcium ion channel in the brain. The ion channel is located at the synapse, at the very end of the neuron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When an electrical signal passes through the neuron, the ion channel open, setting in motion a process leading to neurotransmitter being released towards the receiving neuron in the synapse. In this way, CaV2.1 channels are the gatekeepers of synaptic, neuron-to-neuron communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prolonged electrical activity reduces the number of CaV2.1 channels that can open, resulting in less transmitter release, so the receiving neuron receives a weaker message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is as if the channels can ‘remember’ previous signalling, and in doing so, make themselves unavailable to open by subsequent signals. How this works at the molecular level has been unknown to scientists until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Linköping researchers have now discovered a mechanism for how the ion channel can ‘remember’. The channel is a large molecule made up of several interconnected parts, which can move relative to each other in response to electrical signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They discovered that the ion channel can take almost 200 different shapes depending on the strength and duration of an electrical signal; it is a very complex molecular machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe that during sustained electrical nerve signalling, an important part of the molecule disconnects from the channel gate, similar to the way the clutch in a car breaks the connection between the engine and the wheels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ion channel can then no longer be opened. When hundreds of signals occur over long enough time, they can convert most channels into this ‘declutched memory state’ for several seconds,” says Antonios Pantazis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the ion channel can ‘remember’ for just a few seconds, how does it contribute to lifelong learning? This type of collective memory in the ion channels can accumulate over time and reduce the communication between two neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This then leads to changes in the receiving neuron, lasting for hours or days. Eventually, it results in much longer-lived changes in the brain, such as the elimination of weakened synapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this way, a ‘memory’ that lasts for a few seconds in a single molecule can make a small contribution to a person’s memory that lasts for a lifetime,” says Antonios Pantazis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased knowledge of how these calcium ion channels work can in the long term contribute to the treatment of certain diseases. There are many variants of the gene that produces the CaV2.1 channel, CACNA1A, that are linked to rare but serious neurological diseases, that often run in families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To develop drugs against these, it helps to know which part of the large ion channel you want to affect and in what way its activity should be changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work pinpoints which part of the protein should be targeted when developing new drugs,” says Antonios Pantazis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research has been funded by the Swedish Research Council, the Linköping University Wallenberg Centre for Molecular Medicine, the Swedish Brain Foundation, the Swedish Heart-Lung Foundation, the Lions Research Fund for Public Diseases and the NIH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://liu.se/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Antonios Pantazis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://liu.se/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Linkoping University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Antonios Pantazis – Linkoping University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58884-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A rich conformational palette underlies human Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1-channel availability&lt;/a&gt;” by Antonios Pantazis et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A rich conformational palette underlies human Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1-channel availability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depolarization-evoked opening of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 (P/Q-type) Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-channels triggers neurotransmitter release, while voltage-dependent inactivation (VDI) limits channel availability to open, contributing to synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mechanism of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 response to voltage is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using voltage-clamp fluorometry and kinetic modeling, we optically track and physically characterize the structural dynamics of the four Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 voltage-sensor domains (VSDs). The VSDs are differentially sensitive to voltage changes, both brief and long-lived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VSD-I seems to directly drive opening and convert between two modes of function, associated with VDI. VSD-II is apparently voltage-insensitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VSD-III and VSD-IV sense more negative voltages and undergo voltage-dependent conversion uncorrelated with VDI. Auxiliary β-subunits regulate VSD-I-to-pore coupling and VSD conversion kinetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, the central role of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 channels in synaptic release, and their contribution to plasticity, memory formation and learning, can arise from the voltage-dependent conformational changes of VSD-I.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 16:21:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE9XdUZ1d3ppWGttSm8xNGR4WlJUMTVFdVNUU25vTlMwMXNOWDNmQWlmMmpEQjN2ZkIyMkVDbXZPeWtybDVSZkxWZVgtZXo4SG1ZM1lqQnZ4dW9MZlpJc0twNGcyMVNuWERON3FBdEF0clk</guid></item><item><title>垃圾食品正在用微塑料填充我们的大脑，增加心理健康风险，科学家警告- gizmodo.com | Junk Food Is Filling Our Brains With Microplastics, Raising Mental Health Risks, Scientists Warn - gizmodo.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwwFBVV95cUxPMXcxTXhXSm5ES2ZNNXljUXRyQ3ZLZFJ4em4taE4xNURsejJ6RWtHODJrc3VZbW10UWdGWkZ4UlhzVy1DcG1qR0JINUJnc2NrTndrT0prSGhGRktpMDZUdWZhenhFZFpLeDBTNmZxNGVBMnQ2aXJZSVMtUHFrSUdNcE9ndmg0bXNFMk1ObDRSNFFFRW1RLUgxOFZxa3pvbV9MZW5XamZnWkNQRENTWGx2YWYtX19kUWp1S2VFR2ZNeGNFY1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientists have found alarming amounts of microplastics in virtually everything, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/microplastics-in-blood-air-water-everywhere-1851492637"&gt;&lt;span&gt;from sea turtles to testicles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. But discovering a plastic spoon’s worth of these pernicious particles inside human brains may be the most disturbing of all. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That recent &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03453-1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;finding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; prompted researchers to dig deeper into the health consequences of plastic accumulation in the brain. According to a new review study, published today in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://genomicpress.kglmeridian.com/view/journals/brainmed/aop/article-10.61373-bm025v.0068/article-10.61373-bm025v.0068.xml"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brain Medicine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, microplastics may be the missing link in the relationship between ultra-processed foods and certain neurological disorders, such as depression and dementia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We’re seeing converging evidence that should concern us all,” said lead author Nicholas Fabiano, a psychiatry resident at the University of Ottawa, in a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1084276"&gt;&lt;span&gt;statement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Ultra-processed foods now comprise more than 50% of energy intake in countries like the United States, and these foods contain significantly higher concentrations of microplastics than whole foods,” he added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Indeed, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41370-021-00392-8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;multiple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.124-A191"&gt;&lt;span&gt;studies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; suggest that the more processed a food product is, the more plastic particles it is likely to contain. For example, one study &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749123022352?via%3Dihub"&gt;&lt;span&gt;found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that chicken nuggets contain 30 times more microplastics per gram than chicken breasts. This may be due to the increased amount of plastic that ultra-processed foods are exposed to during processing and packaging, according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://foodpackagingforum.org/news/ultra-processed-food-intake-can-increase-human-exposure-to-phthalates-and-microplastics"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Food Processing Forum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10141840/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.rti.org/insights/microplastics-blood-brain-barrier"&gt;&lt;span&gt;recent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://ryaninstitute.uri.edu/microplastics/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;studies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; have shown that microplastics can bypass the blood-brain barrier: a protective layer of cells surrounding the brain that keeps harmful substances out and locks beneficial chemicals in. The authors of the brain-spoon study, led by Alexander Nihart, Marcus Garcia, and Eliane El Hayek of the University of New Mexico, believe that microplastics infiltrate the blood-brain barrier by hitching a ride on fat molecules.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once these particles get inside the brain, they induce oxidative stress that damages cells and increases the risk of neurological disorders, Fabiano’s study states. He and his colleagues note that microplastics appear to have a particular impact on neurotransmitters that play a role in neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression and dementia. It’s a big, bold claim that still needs to be verified with further research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Interestingly, these harmful effects are strikingly similar to those triggered by ultra-processed foods, according to the researchers. A previous review &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-077310"&gt;&lt;span&gt;found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that people who consumed these foods had a significantly higher risk of depression, anxiety, and poor sleep. And &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2799140"&gt;&lt;span&gt;multiple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37831127/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;studies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; have linked this type of diet to an increased risk of dementia. As a result, Fabiano and his colleagues suggest that microplastics could be a hidden driver of neurological disorders associated with ultra-processed food consumption. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This hypothesis is particularly compelling because we see remarkable overlap in biological mechanisms,” said co-author Wolfgang Marx, senior research fellow at Deakin University in Australia, in the statement. “Ultra-processed foods have been linked to adverse mental health through inflammation, oxidative stress, epigenetics, mitochondrial dysfunction, and disruptions to neurotransmitter systems. Microplastics appear to operate through remarkably similar pathways,” he added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, that’s the bad news. Here’s the good news: a complementary study, also published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://genomicpress.kglmeridian.com/view/journals/brainmed/aop/article-10.61373-bm025l.0056/article-10.61373-bm025l.0056.xml"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brain Medicine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; today, provides the “first evidence” to suggest that a well-established medical technique called extracorporeal apheresis could remove microplastics from the body. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This procedure involves extracting a patient’s blood and running it through a machine that separates it into its parts: plasma and blood cells. Then, the plasma is filtered to remove any unwanted substances (like microplastics) and the clean plasma and blood cells are put back into the patient. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s a relatively simple technique that’s used all over the world for certain types of blood donation, therapeutic purposes, stem cell collection, and more. In tests with 21 patients, at least two rounds of extracorporeal apheresis with double-filtration successfully removed microplastics from their blood, according to the study. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“While we need to reduce our exposure to microplastics through better food choices and packaging alternatives, we also need research into how to remove these particles from the human body,” said lead-author Stefan Bornstein, a professor of cardiovascular and metabolic medicine at King’s College London, in the statement. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Our early findings suggest that apheresis might offer one possible pathway for microplastic removal, though much more research is needed,” he added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thus, as the global plastic crisis becomes more troubling by the day, exploring ways to protect the body from microplastics could help us clear our minds—literally. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

It supports the pelvic organs: the bowel, bladder, and uterus or prostate. These in turn support the spine, and play an important role in sexual health and urinary and fecal continence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When the pelvic floor is working well, we tend to take it for granted, says Dr Ekene A Enemchukwu, a urogynecologist and director of urology at the Stanford Pelvic Health Center. But when it is not functioning correctly, “it can significantly impact functionality and quality of life,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="3c153189-8d3d-47c3-805d-32379b02069e" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"The private pain of prolapse: six things I wish I’d known – from sex to exercise to mental health","elementId":"3c153189-8d3d-47c3-805d-32379b02069e","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/18/the-private-pain-of-prolapse-six-things-i-wish-id-known-from-sex-to-exercise-to-mental-health"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Common pelvic floor disorders include urinary or fecal incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, pelvic pain and sexual dysfunction, says Enemchukwu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;We asked pelvic health experts what are the biggest myths about the pelvic floor, and how to care for yours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="myth-no-1-pelvic-floor-issues-are-a-womens-issue" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No 1: Pelvic floor issues are a women’s issue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Everyone has a pelvic floor – males, females, children,” says Reardon. The three biggest risk factors for developing pelvic floor disorders – pregnancy, birth and menopause – tend to affect women, but pelvic floor disorder is still common in men, says Reardon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Men with pelvic floor disorders can experience urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, rectal prolapse (from chronic straining or constipation) and pelvic pain from tension in the pelvic floor muscles, says Enemchukwu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Even in people who don’t experience pregnancy or childbirth, the stress and strain of everyday life can take its toll on the pelvis, says Dr Cassandra Kisby, a urogynecologist and assistant professor at Duke University hospital. “The pelvis can respond to our environment, our emotions, our traumas,” she explains. “We carry stress in our pelvic floor, and that affects its function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="myth-no-2-pelvic-floor-disorders-are-inevitable" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No 2: Pelvic floor disorders are inevitable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One of the biggest mistakes people make when it comes to their pelvic floor health is not distinguishing between common and normal symptoms, says Kisby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Many things that happen to the pelvic floor are common, but don’t need to be accepted as the norm,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4},"elementId":"d97c1966-927e-4cad-88ae-fd67339a2b08","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="d97c1966-927e-4cad-88ae-fd67339a2b08" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’" data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Pelvic floor issues are extremely common. Urinary leakage, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/is-urine-incontinence-normal-for-women" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;affects&lt;/a&gt; roughly 50% of adult women, and 75% of women over the age of 65. An &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/blog/pain-during-sex.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; 75% of women will experience pain during intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I have women come in and say: ‘I have three babies, and I leak sometimes when I sneeze and I have to change my clothes, but that’s normal for my age.’” But it doesn’t have to be, says Kisby. “I really urge patients to think about quality of life and what we can do about it because there are treatment options.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="myth-no-3-your-doctor-will-know-to-ask-about-your-pelvic-floor-health" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No 3: Your doctor will know to ask about your pelvic floor health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Patients often have to advocate for themselves when it comes to pelvic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Physicians aren’t screening women for these issues,” says Reardon. Because the pelvic floor affects so many systems in the body, it can also be difficult to know which doctor to ask about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Our medical world is so siloed,” says Reardon. “There’s one doctor who looks at the uterus, one who looks at the colon, one who looks at the bladder – but nobody’s looking at the muscles, which is the intersection of all these things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The people who do look at these muscles are &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/feb/10/urogynecologist-childbirth-interview" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;urogynecologists&lt;/a&gt;. But according to Kisby, “many women don’t know what a urogynecologist is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We need to find ways to improve awareness, screening and access to multi-disciplinary care,” says Enemchukwu. “Patients do not need to suffer in silence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-23" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It can be helpful for regaining some strength after childbirth, or to address mild cases of incontinence. But for some, pelvic floor issues are a result of the muscles already being too tight, and Kegels only worsen symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For tension in the pelvis, Reardon recommends working on relaxation: “more yoga-type stretches, breathing, massaging the muscle internally and externally to release some of that tension”, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But talk to an expert first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Ideally, care should be individualized and guided by a professional,” says Enemchukwu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="bbba1ac1-c1ee-41e2-a8ec-2d7f2f1a7d66" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":33,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Easy wins: strengthen your pelvic floor a little more every day","elementId":"bbba1ac1-c1ee-41e2-a8ec-2d7f2f1a7d66","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/22/easy-wins-strengthen-your-pelvic-floor-a-little-more-every-day"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="myth-no-5-you-can-only-address-pelvic-floor-issues-when-youre-young" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No 5: You can only address pelvic floor issues when you’re young&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In some cases, pelvic floor injuries present years after they first occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Many women have a childbirth injury of some degree, and oftentimes it will temporarily get better during the initial healing that our body does,” explains Kisby.

Without well-established prevention or cure, we would all agree that dementia is not the fault of the person who has it. Joining support groups or taking steps to engage socially are good ideas for the person living with dementia, but the solutions are not theirs to bear alone. Consider this: dementia visits one in 10 of us around retirement age, and one in three of us a couple decades thereafter. At this prevalence, each of us knows someone living with dementia, whether we realize it or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WXRTN3I4HNEDXCKHJI4QP7UMTM"&gt;We all have the opportunity as family and friends to learn how to care for and be supportive of our loved ones with dementia. Perhaps those of us with healthy brains even have a social responsibility to do so. Friends worth keeping will not run away from but rather run toward those living with dementia. “Running toward” typically starts with taking a short training course. Virtual sessions are available from certified nurses with the Dementia Institute; many communities across the country have in-person training too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GMG4CC36DVBRLHWMWW7DE4NYLY"&gt;– Running Toward&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QDSYEMAGIFDEJDSBZP5FNZTC2I"&gt;Dear Running Toward: This perspective is so valuable. We talk a lot about the importance of preventative care; this strikes me as a kind of proactive care.

          &lt;p&gt;With Mr. Bidens recent prostate cancer diagnosis, a lot of posts are using terms which may not be familiar to the average person.  Stage, Grade, and Gleason score are all different indicators.  Staging reflects how far the cancer has already spread, and presented as Stage I-IV (in many cancers there are also letters as modifiers), with higher numbers being worse.  The exact spread that each cancer needs to reach a specific stage varies from cancer to cancer. It takes into account the size of the tumor, the location and number of lymph nodes to which it has spread, and whether it has established itself in organs not adjacent to the original tumor.  Stage IV is usually spread to distant organs such as the liver, or bones.  The highest value for prostate cancer is IVb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade is how abnormal the individual cells appear under a microscope.  The more abnormal they look, the faster most cancers are likely to progress.  Think of it as a care driving toward a cliff—the Stage is how close the car is to the cliff--how far it has already driven.  The grade is how fast the car is going. It may be far from the cliff, bit if it is going fast, it will reach it sooner.  However, different types of cancer spread at different rates even if they are the same grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gleason Score is a system used specifically in prostate cancer.  In a prostate biopsy, usually several cores are taken from different locations of the prostate that look like they may have cancer.  The grades of the two cores that occur most commonly are added together to give a score of 1-10. A higher score is worse. Mr. Biden could not have had a Stage 9 cancer, but it is possible to have a Gleason score of 9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PSA is prostate-specific antigen. It is usually elevated in prostate cancer, but its routine use in men without symptoms has been controversial.  This is because it is often elevated in men without prostate cancer and it is not elevated in some men with prostate cancer (estimates vary of the numbers, but it is clear that there are many false positives and some false negatives).  The value of the test has also been questioned because prostate cancers are often indolent, growing so slowly that even though there may be a tiny spot of cancer, it may grow so slowly that it will never bother the patient during his lifetime.  The United States Preventive Services Task Force has changed its recommendations over time regarding this test.  It was once recommended for nearly all men over fifty.  Later it was considered to have more harm than benefit in most men.  Currently guidance is that the decision to order it should be based on discussion with patient, taking into account individual risk factors and preferences in men 50-69. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For men over 70, PSA is not recommended at all. Most (possibly all) men will develop small areas of prostate cancer after that age, but because the most of these grow so slowly, it is not likely that the man will live long enough for it to ever bother him.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other factors used in evaluating PSA results besides the absolute total PSA, but so far I have not seen any of them mentioned in the media, so will not discuss. Digital rectal exams have been used in the past, but are less sensitive than PSA.  It one is done, usually PSA is also recommended. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above statements about PSA and DRE apply only to men without symptoms and without specific personal risk factors.  If there are symptoms that suggest a prostates cancer, or if the patient is at higher-than-average risk, it is usually advised to do testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While prostate cancers usually progress slowly, this is not true in all cases.  As Mr. Biden is 82 years old, per USPSTF guidelines, he should not have been screened for prostate cancer in twelve years.  This could be adequate time for him to have had screening before the age of 70 but developed the cancer after he had “aged out” of routine screening.  It is also possible that his cancer is one of the 5-15% of prostate cancers that are not associated with elevated PSA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This is just a brief overview presented in the hope of giving some context to allow nonmedical readers to understand what they see in the media. I am a family medicine physician.  I am sure that urologists and oncologists can provide more detail).&lt;/p&gt;

I decided to put the science to the test for a month&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the whole of February, I swapped at least one serving per day of my go-to proteins with a serving of red or more heavily processed meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This included steak, bacon, lamb, sausage and ground beef, among others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because some science tells us diets consisting only of animal products like red meat and dairy is a surefire way to raise cholesterol, I wanted to make a point to mix each serving I had with whole grains, fruits and vegetables to avoid going to extremes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before embarking on this journey, I took a baseline blood test from &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ivdrips.com/"&gt;IVDrips&lt;/a&gt;. The test showed my LDL (bad) cholesterol and fats called triglycerides were on the cusp of being too high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13613049/Daily-Mail-health-reporter-vegan-cholesterol.html"&gt;isn't the first time I've had results like these&lt;/a&gt;, as they tend to fluctuate. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But left untreated, these levels could cause fat to build up in my arteries and increase my blood sugar, leading to diabetes and heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I also had low vitamin D, which comes from sunlight and foods like egg yolks and fatty fish, but I blamed it on the dreary winter weather keeping me cooped up inside. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, prior to changing my chicken and fish-focused diet, I was finding myself lethargic and just generally unmotivated, which I also blamed on the winter blues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once I started my experiment, I recognized a difference that showed up outside my body and inside my wallet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As I passed by the poultry aisle in the grocery store and stocked up on ground beef, Italian sausage, bacon, steak and ground lamb, I immediately noticed the price jump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A pound of ground beef at my local New York City grocery store costs about $9 compared to $7 for the same amount of ground chicken or turkey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While I tried to eat most of my meals at home, I had an easy time finding red and more processed meats while out to eat. These included a 'wall' of bacon (left) and one of many charcuterie boards (right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured at left is a pasta I made with Italian sausage. At right is Mongolian beef with rice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Throughout the experiment, I tried to strike a balance between heavily and not heavily processed meats. If I made Greek lamb meatballs or a hamburger one night, for example, I'd add a serving of bacon or sausage to my breakfast the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because recent research has started to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14268299/top-doctor-red-meat-colon-cancer.html"&gt;draw a line between levels of processed meats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Foods like bacon tend to have higher levels of sodium and potentially carcinogenic chemicals as opposed to animal proteins that go through less steps of manipulation to reach our plates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A report published last year in &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13746823/oncologist-discovery-record-colon-cancer-patients.html"&gt;NPJ Precision Oncology&lt;/a&gt;, for example, suggested heavily processed meats produce metabolites, which researchers said 'feed' cancer cells and 'hijack' normal cells in the colon, causing them to mutate and grow uncontrollably. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During the trial period, I also tried to eat most of my meals at home so I could better control portions. When I did choose to eat out, I found most restaurants had a pretty large variety of red meat to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I expected to feel run down and sluggish after swapping poultry for burgers, steak, sausages and hot dogs, but was surprised when I hardly noticed anything change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were some mild effects like indigestion and a bit of bloating if I had a particularly greasy meat, but other than just generally preferring poultry or fish, nothing seemed drastically different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were subtle pros and cons, however.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For one, it seemed like the winter blues brain fog I'd been wrestling with had dissipated slightly after my month of meat. This goes directly against recent studies that have tied red and heavily processed meats to cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A friend's birthday party took me to a local barbecue joint, where I was able to mix sausages with turkey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While I don't normally put meat in my breakfast, I stepped out of my comfort zone with bacon (left) and steak and eggs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14287665/red-meat-increase-dementia-risk-study.html"&gt;Harvard study&lt;/a&gt;, for example, found eating one serving of heavily processed meat - roughly two slices of bacon or a single sausage - daily for four decades was linked to a 13 percent increased risk of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While I seemed to clear up mentally, it's unlikely that just a month of adding more red meat to my diet was the sole cure to my seasonal depression. It could also be due, in part, to the leafy greens and whole grains I added to most meals during the trial period - &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29263222/"&gt;they've been shown to lower inflammation&lt;/a&gt; in the brain and improve mental clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I also found myself not staying quite as full as I had while eating chicken, which could be due to the amount - rather than the type - of protein I was consuming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The USDA estimates every three-ounce serving of chicken has roughly 31 grams of protein, while the same serving of ground beef contains 26 grams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experiment also got me to try some foods out of my comfort zone like a 'wall' of bacon appetizer at a local bar and flank steak stir fry. Still, by the end, I was a little sick of red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end of the month I underwent a second blood test from the IVDrips team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I expected my already borderline high cholesterol to skyrocket and my triglycerides to go up even more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, my LDL cholesterol actually decreased eight percent, and my triglycerides dropped by one-third. My HDL (good) cholesterol remained the same in both tests - I was both impressed and surprised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The only metric that worsened after the month-long trial was my alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme in the liver and bile ducts. When found in excess, it has been tied to fatty liver disease, but when lacking, could be a sign of zinc or vitamin B12 deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both zinc and vitamin B12 are often found in poultry and salmon, foods I'd largely sworn off for the past month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While I'm not likely to completely overhaul my diet and strip out my favorite proteins, it's possible red and processed meats aren't the boogeymen I've been writing about all these years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, I'll stick to adding more steak and sausage to my diet gradually instead of giving up my beloved chicken and fish altogether. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the 1600s, yellow fever and its mosquito carriers were endemic to Africa. Later, they spread to the Americas via the transatlantic slave trade, sometimes killing up to 10 percent of some local populations in the New World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the virus began taking over Europe, roughly a century later, it became known as the "American plague".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of a highly effective yellow fever vaccine in the 1930s changed everything. Yellow fever mosquitoes were also almost completely eradicated in the Western Hemisphere, and the two factors stopped urban spread in the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the decades since, yellow fever mosquitoes have re-infested much of the neotropics, and while Africa continues to experience intermittent &lt;span&gt;epidemics&lt;/span&gt; in urban centers, the Americas have been free of a yellow fever &lt;span&gt;epidemic&lt;/span&gt; for 80-plus years, only experiencing small and infrequent outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are concerned that reprieve won't last for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, there's been a worrisome resurgence in yellow fever outbreaks in &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/yellow-fever/who-warns-yellow-fever-spread-13-african-nations"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON570"&gt;Americas&lt;/a&gt;, possibly because of poor vaccine coverage, expansion of human populations, lack of travel restrictions, and/or lack of mosquito control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161983" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161983" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/yf_afro.jpg" alt="Africa YF Distribution" class="size-full wp-image-161983" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/yf_afro.jpg 577w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/yf_afro-469x415.jpg 469w" sizes="(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161983" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Distribution of reported confirmed yellow fever cases in eight countries in the WHO African Region between 1 October 2023 and 21 February 2024. (&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON510"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Gubler and colleagues, tropical cities that have not historically experienced yellow fever now &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44298-024-00079-5"&gt;face&lt;/a&gt; "the greatest risk in over 70 years" of an &lt;span&gt;epidemic&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Of primary concern in this regard is the Asia-Pacific region," the team &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44298-024-00079-5"&gt;adds&lt;/a&gt;, "where over two billion susceptible people live in areas infested by yellow fever mosquitoes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These mosquito populations aren't carrying the yellow fever virus just yet, but they are species that are capable of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a human traveller with yellow fever returns to the Asia-Pacific region after travel in Africa or South America, it is possible that local mosquitoes bite them and contract the virus. This could allow for spread among new insect populations in new regions, threatening local humans with a spillover event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161970" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161970" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/Yellow_fever_risk_countries_map.svg_-642x326.png" alt="Yellow Fever Map" class="size-medium wp-image-161970" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/Yellow_fever_risk_countries_map.svg_-642x326.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/Yellow_fever_risk_countries_map.svg_-818x415.png 818w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/Yellow_fever_risk_countries_map.svg_-768x390.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/Yellow_fever_risk_countries_map.svg_-1536x780.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/Yellow_fever_risk_countries_map.svg_-600x305.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/Yellow_fever_risk_countries_map.svg_.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161970" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Yellow fever risk countries map based on 2019 WHO designations.

&lt;p&gt;"If the virus is introduced to a permissive nonendemic country, especially one located in Asia, the disease might be first misdiagnosed as dengue, likely resulting in spread before being recognized as the yellow fever virus."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are we to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers say that first, we need to expand the global supply of yellow fever vaccines and improve coverage. Otherwise, outbreaks will continue and we won't be ready if the virus spreads to new regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gubler and colleagues also argue for increased surveillance of yellow fever cases in poor countries where the disease is endemic, and in non-endemic countries where the virus could possibly spread in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Immunization services, disease surveillance, and the outbreak response in nearly 50 countries are already being disrupted – with setbacks at a similar level to what we saw during COVID-19," &lt;a href="https://www.unicef.org/rosa/press-releases/increases-vaccine-preventable-disease-outbreaks-threaten-years-progress-warn-who"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell in April 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We cannot afford to lose ground in the fight against preventable diseases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perspective was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44298-024-00079-5"&gt;&lt;i&gt;NPJ Viruses&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Unlike opioids, SBI-810 precisely targets a single brain receptor pathway linked to pain reduction, avoiding the euphoric “high” and dangerous complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice, the drug effectively relieved pain from surgery, fractures, and nerve injury, and even enhanced opioid effects at lower doses without causing tolerance. It also outperformed current medications like gabapentin without inducing sedation or memory problems. SBI-810 works by activating neurotensin receptor 1 using a technique called biased agonism, offering pain relief through a safer signaling route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precision Targeting:&lt;/strong&gt; SBI-810 activates a single pain-relief pathway (β-arrestin-2) without affecting addictive opioid-related pathways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Tolerance or Sedation:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice treated with SBI-810 didn’t develop tolerance or experience common side effects like sedation or memory loss.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Effectiveness:&lt;/strong&gt; SBI-810 reduced pain from various sources and boosted opioid effects at lower, safer doses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Duke University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An experimental drug developed at Duke University School of Medicine could offer powerful pain relief without the dangerous side effects of opioids.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug, called SBI-810, is part of a new generation of compounds designed to target a receptor on the nerves and spinal cord. While opioids flood multiple cellular pathways indiscriminately, SBI-810, a non-opioid treatment, takes a more focused approach, activating only a specific pain-relief pathway that avoids the euphoric “high” linked to addiction.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110171"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/non-opioid-pain-killer-neurosicnece.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/non-opioid-pain-killer-neurosicnece-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/non-opioid-pain-killer-neurosicnece-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/non-opioid-pain-killer-neurosicnece-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/non-opioid-pain-killer-neurosicnece-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/non-opioid-pain-killer-neurosicnece-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/non-opioid-pain-killer-neurosicnece-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/non-opioid-pain-killer-neurosicnece.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and pills." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/non-opioid-pain-killer-neurosicnece.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/non-opioid-pain-killer-neurosicnece-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/non-opioid-pain-killer-neurosicnece-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/non-opioid-pain-killer-neurosicnece-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/non-opioid-pain-killer-neurosicnece-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/non-opioid-pain-killer-neurosicnece-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/non-opioid-pain-killer-neurosicnece-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Duke scientists compared SBI-810 to oliceridine, a newer type of opioid used in hospitals, and found SBI-810 worked better in some situations, with fewer signs of distress. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In tests in mice, SBI-810 worked well on its own and, when used in combination, made opioids more effective at lower doses, according to the study published May 19 in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What makes this compound exciting is that it is both analgesic and non-opioid,” said senior study author Ru-Rong Ji, PhD, an anesthesiology and neurobiology researcher who directs the Duke Anesthesiology Center for Translational Pain Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more encouraging: it prevented common side effects like constipation and buildup of tolerance, which often forces patients to need stronger and more frequent doses of opioids over time.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SBI-810 is in early development, but Duke researchers are aiming for human trials soon and they’ve locked in multiple patents for the discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s an urgent need for pain relief alternatives. Drug overdose deaths are declining, but more than 80,000 Americans still die each year most often from opioids. Meanwhile, chronic pain affects one-third of the U.S. population.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers said the drug could be a safer option for treating both short-term and chronic pain for those recovering from surgery or living with diabetic nerve pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SBI-810 is designed to target the brain receptor neurotensin receptor 1. Using a method known as biased agonism, it switches on a specific signal—β-arrestin-2—linked to pain relief, while avoiding other signals that can cause side effects or addiction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The receptor is expressed on sensory neurons and the brain and spinal cord,” Ji said. “It’s a promising target for treating acute and chronic pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SBI-810 effectively relieved pain from surgical incisions, bone fractures, and nerve injuries better than some existing painkillers. When injected in mice, it reduced signs of spontaneous discomfort, such as guarding and facial grimacing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duke scientists compared SBI-810 to oliceridine, a newer type of opioid used in hospitals, and found SBI-810 worked better in some situations, with fewer signs of distress.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike opioids like morphine, SBI-810 didn’t cause tolerance after repeated use. It also outperformed gabapentin, a common drug for nerve pain, and didn’t cause sedation or memory problems, which are often seen with gabapentin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers said the compound’s dual action—on both the peripheral and central nervous systems— could offer a new kind of balance in pain medicine: powerful enough to work, yet specific enough to avoid harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by the NIH and the Department of Defense.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Duke authors include first authors Ran Guo and Ouyang Chen; Sangsu Bang, Sharat Chandra, Yize Li, Gang Chen, Rou-Gang Xie, Wei He, Jing Xu, Richard Zhou, Shaoyong Song, Ivan Spasojevic, Marc G.

SBI-810’s analgesic effects require NTSR1 and βarr2 but not NTSR2 or βarr1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mechanistically, SBI-810 suppresses excitatory synaptic transmission, inhibits NMDA receptor and extracellular-regulated signal kinase (ERK) signaling in spinal cord nociceptive neurons, reduces Nav1.7 surface expression and action potential firing in primary sensory neurons, and dampens C-fiber responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behaviorally, it reduces opioid-induced conditioned place preference, alleviates constipation, and mitigates chronic opioid withdrawal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight NTSR1-biased allosteric modulators as a promising, non-addictive therapeutic strategy for acute and chronic pain management, acting through both peripheral and central mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 14:59:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE9qTXczQ0pVb0x2dFNMU3phdHk1SkhvYUFkNEFxeXYxMDV0Q0RHNy1Hd3RiMlVRRVdtVWhzN0R0M01fbVFTSGpFWnVjVFplQVgteXh4ZVZSZ1N1YUZPbXd3T25iY3ByQWZESDJicGJkU1EtNUFF</guid></item><item><title>微妙的迹象，我默默中风，随时可能死亡-每日邮报 | Subtle signs I was having a silent STROKE and could've died at any moment - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxONmE4UHpKSkwtcUJMVnNUeDRaZFF5VU9JNDYxU0RJcjAyS3Y3Z1BOOG1udjkweDN6VWFfYl9zZ1ZxWktJQ2lObWhtYzE5U3lISFB1a1JFbXJoWWtwenBNS08zWHk0VkpYUnR3SEw5VEY3ZmJ6T0VZX0dMN0ZnUlhZaGYwZkFwdmJ5V2tYVnQ1S1Z2SnRNNHlZ0gGcAUFVX3lxTFBUa3h2b2dTYU9rcEluWXFOQ1dJTWRQa1M5Q3Nkd29vSzZ5X2NyOWNOSlRRQ003MXRUa1VVY0ptWk4tRXpBcm10X1NVRWxDeXB0WVlSZ2Y0NFpJUjBJYVRvT0tDVlgxdk40MzFDR1dhNVVFVnY3WUFtbUJzcTRTRGx2MG1TUDh2OGY5b1JQUnZvbE9Lb29vRk11cHNNcA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Lexi Eddy sent Snapchats to her friends earlier this year, they instantly knew something was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She had just collapsed out of her chair at her after-school job at a nursing home in Atwater, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/ohio/index.html" id="mol-99859580-3580-11f0-aa11-db606e76e275" class=""&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, and didn't understand what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 18-year-old’s face was drooping on one side, her words were slurred, and her left hand hung limp — but no one knew she was in the middle of a life-threatening stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘What’s wrong with your face?’ her friends frantically messaged. ‘It looks like you’re having a stroke.

So then in my head, I was just like, “Crap, this is a stroke.”’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once they arrived at the Cleveland Clinic, Melissa said: ‘It felt like 90 minutes of pure craziness.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With time working against them – treating within three hours of the stroke affords the best possible outcomes – doctors quickly administered an IV dose of a TNK-tPA (tenecteplase) to dissolve blood clots in the blocked blood vessel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eddy said: ‘[In the moment] I can't comprehend all of it and I just start sobbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There are people saying, “Push the medicine through! Push the medicine through now!” When I started sobbing, that's when it all just really hit me.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor warned if the medication failed to dissolve the clot, Lexi would require brain surgery, but a follow-up CT scan confirmed the treatment worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Eddy had just collapsed out of her chair at her after-school job at a nursing home in Atwater, Ohio . Coworkers helped her sit back up, but at that point, she could no longer move her left hand. A colleague called emergency services to take her to the local hospital &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within about an hour of receiving the drug, she began regaining feeling, movement, and speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eddy said: ‘The second I got out of the CT scan, a nurse came over and squeezed my hand. Before that, my dad had been holding my hand, and I hadn’t felt anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But this time, I said, “Oh, wait, I can feel it now.” The feeling wasn’t 100 percent yet, but it was much better than before.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within four days spent at the hospital, Eddy nearly fully recovered movement in her left side, with her facial drooping, slurred speech, and headaches disappearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Dr Mohammad's team launched an intensive workup to pinpoint what caused her stroke in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A battery of tests ruled out tumors, an irregular heartbeat, blood deficiencies and other factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But they did find Eddy had Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO), a small, flap-like hole between the upper chambers of the heart (atria) that failed to close after birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 25 percent of Americans have the condition and it is usually harmless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;With time working against them – treating a stroke within three hours of the stroke affords the best possible outcomes. They administered an IV drug to break up the blood clot in Eddy's brain, which was successful&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some cases, however, like Eddy's, the flap that didn't fuse shut can allow blood clots to bypass the lungs and reach the brain, causing a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Because a PFO is so common, we have to eliminate every other possible cause,’ Dr Mohammad said. ‘Once we do that, we are left with PFO and then decide if there is a relationship between the PFO and the stroke.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To confirm, EDDY'S medical team administered the RoPE test, which measures whether a PFO likely unleashed a stroke-causing clot. For EDDY, the score was a high 88 percent probability that her heart’s tiny hole was the hidden culprit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roughly 795,000 people in the United States experience a stroke each year.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Advanced age is a leading risk factor, with approximately half of all strokes occurring in people over 75 and a third in those over 85.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But about 10 to 15 percent of strokes occur in children and adults under 45, and this number is rising due to a confluence of lifestyle factors like diet and obesity, rising rates of underlying chronic conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes, and undiagnosed heart conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just weeks after graduating high school – and before starting her teaching degree at Kent State – Eddy will undergo a minimally invasive procedure at the Cleveland Clinic to seal the tiny hole in her heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Just weeks after graduating high school – and before starting her teaching degree at Kent State – Eddy will undergo a minimally invasive procedure at the Cleveland Clinic to seal the tiny hole in her heart&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr Mohammad, this will bring her risk of experiencing another stroke to near zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eddy, meanwhile, sees the experience as an opportunity to get the best out of her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Before my stroke, I was wasting my time and energy on things I shouldn’t be. I wasn’t happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘After my stroke, I realized you can’t take what you have for granted.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Life is going to be both hard and good,’ she added. ‘And I want to do everything for the greater good. Anything that brings joy to other people is what I want to be doing.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 14:44:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxONmE4UHpKSkwtcUJMVnNUeDRaZFF5VU9JNDYxU0RJcjAyS3Y3Z1BOOG1udjkweDN6VWFfYl9zZ1ZxWktJQ2lObWhtYzE5U3lISFB1a1JFbXJoWWtwenBNS08zWHk0VkpYUnR3SEw5VEY3ZmJ6T0VZX0dMN0ZnUlhZaGYwZkFwdmJ5V2tYVnQ1S1Z2SnRNNHlZ0gGcAUFVX3lxTFBUa3h2b2dTYU9rcEluWXFOQ1dJTWRQa1M5Q3Nkd29vSzZ5X2NyOWNOSlRRQ003MXRUa1VVY0ptWk4tRXpBcm10X1NVRWxDeXB0WVlSZ2Y0NFpJUjBJYVRvT0tDVlgxdk40MzFDR1dhNVVFVnY3WUFtbUJzcTRTRGx2MG1TUDh2OGY5b1JQUnZvbE9Lb29vRk11cHNNcA</guid></item><item><title>碳水化合物的质量会影响一个人的年龄吗？ -今日医学新闻 | Could carb quality affect how a person ages? - Medical News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxOWDY5aHIzNFVKam1HWUhiMXk2c2M3enR4NGtvQWU5U2NkX3V4TXhqNmwtWnVTbnBWcXlEMUs0RnBhR3lPckF4Skh4bHZOdkZyZ096ZWxTRFZ4eUlzbDZNd2V6bkVWaHJvcndQR3JuS1RldXJKbHgyNFN3WkhYNjRaVmUxMUEzcVgzb2R4TFRVTEtkSjlCdnREMlpfWF9iYlp3TTk0bEppQS1NN3ZyWWlCeXo0R2ZXVFBqZlpqT0xzZ2k?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-yhe8zq"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/05/holding-bread-slices-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/05/holding-bread-slices-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/05/holding-bread-slices-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/05/holding-bread-slices-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg" alt="A person holds wholegrain slices of bread stacked on top of each other between their hands" class="css-1jytyml"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="icon-hl-pinterest css-11oz8gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalnewstoday.com%2Farticles%2Fhigh-quality-carbs-wholegrains-vegetables-food-groups-may-aid-healthy-aging-women&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F05%2Fholding-bread-slices-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg&amp;amp;description=Could%20carb%20quality%20affect%20how%20a%20person%20ages%3F" title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/05/holding-bread-slices-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-13b3g0x"&gt;Carbohydrate quality may be an important factor in healthy aging, a new study finds.

He and his team found that how much &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/146935" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;dietary fiber&lt;/a&gt; and the quality of &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/161547" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt; consumed during midlife can have a major impact on healthy aging for older women.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this study, researchers analyzed diet and health data from more than 47,000 women who completed the Nurses’ Health Study questionnaires between 1984 and 2016. By 2016, participants ranged in age from 70 to 93.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists included data on each participant’s dietary fiber intake and evaluated the types of total amount of carbohydrates participants consumed and their quality:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Carbohydrates contribute about half of our total calorie intake, and come in many different forms (i.e., refined, complex, simple sugars, dietary fiber) and from many sources (refined grains, added sugars, fruits, vegetables, whole-grains, potatoes, etc.) with many health implications,” Ardisson Korat explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that consumption of different types of carbohydrates has implications in the risk of developing and dying from many chronic diseases; however, they [have] not examined the role of dietary carbohydrates and carbohydrate quality in healthy aging,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the study’s conclusion, researchers found that focusing on eating high-quality carbohydrates from whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes, and total dietary fiber in midlife, correlated to a 6-37% better chance of healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consuming high quality carbohydrates, those from fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes, can increase our likelihood of aging healthily,” Ardisson Korat said. “What’s more, consuming carbohydrates from these sources increases our chances of avoiding chronic diseases and preserving good physical and cognitive function into older adulthood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists also found that eating more refined carbohydrates led to a 13% lower chance for healthy aging and eating more starchy vegetables — such as &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/280579" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;potatoes&lt;/a&gt; and corn — led to a 10% lower chance. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dietary carbohydrate quality is important for healthy aging,” Ardisson Korat explained. “Our study showed that consuming high quality carbohydrates is favorably linked with healthy aging, and on the same line, consuming carbohydrates from refined sources (i.e., refined grains, added sugars) is linked to lower chances of becoming a healthy ager.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High quality vs. refined carbs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s more, in this study, we looked at the relationship between increasing high-quality carbohydrates while decreasing refined carbohydrates (in a substitution analysis) with healthy aging. We found that this replacement — more high-quality carbohydrates, less refined carbohydrates — is associated with 16% higher likelihood of becoming a healthy ager.” &lt;br&gt;— Ardisson Korat, lead author&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.sjpp.org/find-a-doctor/sheryl-ross-md/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Sheryl Ross, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a board certified OB/GYN and Women’s Health Expert at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, about this study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ross commented that the findings in this relevant study are unexpected but not surprising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now there is a large sample size study to show eating high-quality carbohydrates including whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes with high fiber, support healthy aging,” she explained. “There is an appropriate saying, ‘genetics loads the gun, and lifestyle pulls the trigger.’ This analogy highlights how genetic predispositions to certain medical conditions may be your destiny, but healthy lifestyle changes can minimize the effects on aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habits that speed up aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Harmful, and avoidable, lifestyle habits include smoking, inactivity, eating an unhealthy diet (including fast food!), [e]xcessive &lt;hl-trusted-source source="National Institute on Aging" rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alcohol-misuse-or-alcohol-use-disorder/facts-about-aging-and-alcohol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, and not sleeping well contribute to heart disease, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/159283" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/effects-of-high-cholesterol" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, certain cancers, and cognitive decline.”&lt;br&gt;— Sheryl Ross, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lifestyle modifications including eating a healthy diet, regular exercising, limiting alcohol consumption, sleeping seven hours a night, minimizing stress, and not smoking are ways to improve your longevity and support healthy aging,” Ross added. “Controlling positive lifestyle modifications prevent chronic medical complications which supports a better quality of life and healthy aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also spoke with &lt;a href="https://eatrightrx.com/about-me-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Monique Richard, MS, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Nutrition-In-Sight, for her top tips on how readers can eat the healthiest types of carbohydrates possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Keep in mind that not all carbohydrates are created equal. Looking at ingredients and understanding food groups will be important in making optimal choices,” Richard explained.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to eating healthy, high quality carbs, Richard recommended that readers look for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fresh produce:&lt;/strong&gt; Prepare and consume in ways that minimally degrade &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/phytonutrients" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;phytonutrients&lt;/a&gt; such as raw in salads, lightly steamed or blanched, sautéed, roasted or grilled.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose Whole Grains:&lt;/strong&gt; Look for “whole rye” or “’whole oat” as ingredients in breads, cereals, and pastas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shake Things Up:&lt;/strong&gt; Alternate preparing more traditional and common &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/benefits-of-whole-grains" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt; with alternative options — or mix them together, try sorghum, barley, bulgur, millet, spelt, farro, or freekeh.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resistant Starch:&lt;/strong&gt; It can be found in cooled potatoes, rice, and pasta, as well as green bananas, beans, legumes, and nuts and seeds. Foods in this category are lower on the &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325660" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;glycemic index&lt;/a&gt; and can feed our gut microbiota. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snack Right:&lt;/strong&gt; A convenient way to add in more fiber throughout the day is with snacks such as dried fruit (without added sugar), &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323042" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;nuts&lt;/a&gt; such as walnuts, almonds, and peanuts, and seeds like sunflower kernels, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/303864" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;pumpkin seeds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/291334" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;chia seeds&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/263405" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;flaxseed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Forget Pulses:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;Adding &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320192" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;beans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/297638" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;lentils&lt;/a&gt;, and peas to salads or soups or m&lt;/span&gt;aking dips or spreads—hummus or refried beans—can be a great way to add more fiber and nutrients to meals and side dishes in an inexpensive and tasty way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Out of Your Comfort Zone:&lt;/strong&gt; Try new methods of cooking, seasoning, or side dishes from cultures other than your own. Explore a new vegetable, fruit, or whole grain once a week or once a month.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You wouldn’t ask a stranger to advise you on your retirement portfolio so why get health and nutrition advice from TikTok or IG?” Richard added. “Seek out a registered dietitian nutritionist to help clarify what makes sense for your health and nutritional needs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 14:38:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxOWDY5aHIzNFVKam1HWUhiMXk2c2M3enR4NGtvQWU5U2NkX3V4TXhqNmwtWnVTbnBWcXlEMUs0RnBhR3lPckF4Skh4bHZOdkZyZ096ZWxTRFZ4eUlzbDZNd2V6bkVWaHJvcndQR3JuS1RldXJKbHgyNFN3WkhYNjRaVmUxMUEzcVgzb2R4TFRVTEtkSjlCdnREMlpfWF9iYlp3TTk0bEppQS1NN3ZyWWlCeXo0R2ZXVFBqZlpqT0xzZ2k</guid></item><item><title>打盹扰乱REM睡眠-神经科学新闻 | Hitting Snooze Disrupts REM Sleep - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZEFVX3lxTE5jOWZNa21nalNhUnpSWWJBRV9Vd04zZG05M3d6ajI0d2M2WGROeTJkdG0wbkpuazVPNWtuX0RqOExMdEhhN2V2ZlhHRjduV21ybW82NmEwaTBEWldlMEgzWEJzVEg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Despite expert warnings, hitting the snooze button is a common part of many people’s morning routines. A large global study analyzing data from over 21,000 individuals found that snoozing occurred in 56% of sleep sessions, with heavy users snoozing for up to 20 minutes each morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snooze usage peaked during the workweek and was more common in countries like the U.S., Sweden, and Germany. Researchers warn that snoozing disrupts critical REM sleep phases, offering only fragmented, light sleep before waking. Interestingly, people with shorter total sleep were less likely to snooze, likely due to time pressures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Widespread Habit:&lt;/strong&gt; Over 50% of sleep sessions end with a snooze, averaging 11 minutes of delay.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disruptive to REM:&lt;/strong&gt; Snoozing interrupts deep, restorative stages of sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural Patterns:&lt;/strong&gt; Highest snooze usage observed in the U.S., Sweden, and Germany.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Brigham and Women’s Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep experts recommend against snoozing after a wake-up alarm, but a study led by researchers at Mass General Brigham shows the practice is common, with more than 50% of sleep sessions logged ending in a snooze alarm and users spending 11 minutes on average snoozing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though using the snooze function on an alarm clock isn’t recommended by sleep experts, it’s a common practice, according to a new study led by researchers at Mass General Brigham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using data from the sleep analysis app Sleep Cycle, researchers analyzed sleep data from more than 21,000 people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The snooze button was pressed in close to 56% of the 3 million nights studied. Around 45% of study subjects hit the snooze button on more than 80% of mornings. These heavy users snoozed, on average, 20 minutes a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results are published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many of us hit the snooze alarm in the morning with the hope of getting a ‘little more sleep,’ but this widely practiced phenomenon has received little attention in sleep research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a global sample we found that more than half of sleep sessions end in a snooze alarm, and users spent an average of 11 minutes in between snooze alarms each morning before waking,” said lead author Rebecca Robbins, PhD, in the Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reliance upon snooze varied by day of the week, with more snooze alarm during the typical work week (Monday through Friday) with the lowest snooze alarm utilization on Saturday and Sunday mornings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snooze alarm utilization was lower among those sleeping five or fewer hours. According to the researchers, this could be because short sleepers are cutting sleep short due to occupational responsibilities, which would require them to wake up and start their day, leaving little time for a snooze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavy users of the snooze alarm (those relying on snooze alarm on more than 80% of mornings studied) spent on average 20 minutes in between snooze alarms. Heavy snooze alarm users also demonstrated more erratic sleep schedules than other categories of users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People in the U.S., Sweden and Germany had the highest snooze button use, while those living in Japan and Australia had the lowest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, the snooze alarm disrupts some of the most important stages of sleep,” said Robbins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The hours just before waking are rich in rapid eye movement sleep. Hitting the snooze alarm will interrupt these critical stages of sleep and typically only offer you light sleep in between snooze alarms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The best approach for optimizing your sleep and next day performance is to set your alarm for the latest possible time, then commit to getting out of bed when your first alarm goes off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authorship: &lt;/strong&gt;In addition to Robbins, Mass General Brigham authors include Matthew D.

Kennedy Jr. faces a White House deadline this week. His &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/13/rfk-jr-trump-maha-movement-chronic-disease-commission/"&gt;Make America Healthy Again commission&lt;/a&gt; must deliver a diagnosis of the nation’s epidemic of chronic disease. By summer’s end, it will need to offer solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In between comes the battle over priorities. Should the commission go all-in on obesity? Focusing on the fastest-rising conditions would be a sensible approach, but so would working on the sickest parts of the country, or the shared risk factors for many diseases. It might feel pressing, in the age of the U.S. DOGE Service, to take on the conditions that cost the nation the most, but it would also make sense to sink more money into long-underfunded disease prevention efforts. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The epidemic takes on a different tone and tenor depending on what you focus on and where you look. If you were on the commission, what priorities would you choose? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;STAT has gathered and analyzed various sources of publicly available health data to establish a baseline of chronic disease in the U.S. Finding timely and complete data on the prevalence and costs of chronic illness is a pressing concern for decision-makers, but remains a challenge. To close that gap, STAT conducted original statistical analyses, generating novel data points on a wide range of diseases and their consequences. This investigation — which used annual Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality — could help researchers and policymakers better understand the problems facing the nation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Below, we lay out that overview, along with nine different sets of priorities to give the public — and the commission — a chance to decide which they think is the most important, and thus which solutions make most sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A superbug that commonly causes infections in hospitals can feed on plastic used for medical interventions, potentially making it even more dangerous, a world-first study has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bug is a bacteria species called &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;, which is commonly found in hospital environments and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/pseudomonas-aeruginosa/about/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/pseudomonas-aeruginosa/about/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;can cause potentially deadly infections&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the lungs, urinary tract and blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, scientists have analyzed a strain of this bacteria from a hospital patient's wound, which revealed a surprising trick that could enable it to persist on surfaces and in patients for longer — its ability to break down the biodegradable plastics used in stints, sutures and implants. The researchers published their findings May 7 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00421-8?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2211124725004218%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00421-8?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2211124725004218%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It means we need to reconsider how pathogens exist in the hospital environment," study lead author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.brunel.ac.uk/people/ronan-mccarthy" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.brunel.ac.uk/people/ronan-mccarthy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ronan McCarthy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor in biomedical sciences at Brunel University of London, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.brunel.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/articles/'Superbug'-found-to-digest-medical-plastic" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.brunel.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/articles/'Superbug'-found-to-digest-medical-plastic" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;said in a statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

These resistant microbes can contaminate catheters and ventilation devices, making &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3526125/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3526125/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;common cause of hospital-acquired infections&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, especially among vulnerable patients. &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; is tied to roughly &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gardp.org/stories/meet-pseudomonas-aeruginosa/#:~:text=Drug%2Dresistant%20Pseudomonas%20aeruginosa%20is,the%20lungs%2C%20skin%20and%20bloodstream." target="_blank" data-url="https://gardp.org/stories/meet-pseudomonas-aeruginosa/#:~:text=Drug%2Dresistant%20Pseudomonas%20aeruginosa%20is,the%20lungs%2C%20skin%20and%20bloodstream." referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;559,000 deaths per year&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; globally, the majority of which are associated with antimicrobial resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet how the bacteria can thrive in ostensibly sterile hospital environments has remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate, the researchers took a swab from a patient's wound in a British hospital and analyzed it, which revealed the bug can make an enzyme named Pap1. This enzyme is able to break down the plastic polycaprolactone (PCL) — commonly used in sutures, wound dressings, surgical meshes and other medical equipment — and release the plastic's carbon, which &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa &lt;/em&gt;can then feed on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test whether this enzyme is really responsible for breaking down plastic, the scientists inserted the gene that codes for Pap1 into &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/64436-e-coli.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/64436-e-coli.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; bacteria, and found that when that bacteria expressed the enzyme, it too was able to break down PCL. The team further confirmed the enzyme's plastic-eating role when they deleted the gene that codes for it in a &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa &lt;/em&gt;variant, finding that the microbe was no longer able to dissolve the plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bug's plastic-chewing power doesn't just seem to be granting it a food source: It is also making it more dangerously resistant to treatment. This is because the bacteria uses plastic fragments to form hardier biofilms — structures with protective coatings that shield superbugs from antibiotics — the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists also identified similar enzymes in other bacteria, meaning that other widely used medical plastics could be providing sustenance and improved resilience to additional superbugs, possibly contributing to hospital-acquired infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To follow up on this, the researchers have called for urgent research on the prevalence of the plastic-eating enzymes among other pathogens, and for experts to reconsider the plastics they use in medical settings, and the ways that they monitor hospital environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Plastic is everywhere in modern medicine, and it turns out some pathogens have adapted to degrade it," McCarthy said.

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People are no longer willing to blame common bouts of bloating, indigestion, and other digestive issues on an irritated stomach. Over the past decade, many Americans have started to realize just how important gut health is to their overall physical and mental well-being. And their search for products and treatments to promote a healthy gut has taken off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most digestible piece of advice we have to offer for the public is fiber," says &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/find-a-doctor/amiko-m-uchida" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Amiko Uchida MD&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/gi" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;gastroenterologist&lt;/a&gt; and physician-scientist with University of Utah Health. "This is a nutrient that is dramatically lacking from the traditional diet, particularly in the United States and other developed countries."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uchida is passionate about helping her patients and the public achieve better gut health. Often that starts with building their trust in the current science and research, like statistics that show up to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6124841/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;95% of Americans&lt;/a&gt; are not getting enough fiber in their diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber is an essential part of sculpting and shaping the gut microbiota — the community of trillions of microbes, including bacteria, that live in your digestive tract. This gut microbiota is a major part of the human microbiome, which refers to all the microorganisms living in and on the body. These microbes play a vital role in digestion, nutrient absorption, and supporting the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating more fruits and veggies, a primary source of fiber, might sound like an easy fix. But accessing those foods can be a struggle for many people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With fiber, it is difficult, especially when we think about cities and communities that are food deserts," Uchida says. "In those places, nutrients in general can be hard to find while the foods that are available are highly processed or ultra-processed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 65% of the food available in the United States is ultra-processed, Uchida adds. "And the sticker price on fresh foods is higher. These are very important barriers that affect our entire country's health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U of U Health initiatives are addressing this lack of access to fresh foods. "The U has a &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/integrative-health/driving-out-diabetes/food-pharmacy" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;food pharmacy program&lt;/a&gt; that is in various stages of growing," Uchida says. "And there are a lot of providers and investigators at the university who would like to see the program grow into something even bigger, like a farm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Daniel/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The importance of the microbiome&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people who can eat a balanced diet, reduce stress, and get enough exercise, the quest is still on to proactively care for their gut microbiome. Scientists are also studying the link between &lt;a href="https://uofuhealth.utah.edu/newsroom/news/2024/12/microbiome-seed-grants-kickstart-collaborative-science" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;gut health and immunity&lt;/a&gt;, mental health, &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/newsroom/news/2025/03/early-life-gut-microbes-may-protect-against-diabetes-research-mice-suggests" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt;, and people's &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/publicaffairs/news/2024/05/autisms-missing-microbes-may-influence-social-behavior-protecting-gut" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;brains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is important to think about the gut as a central location in our bodies," Uchida says. "It's a unique environment where foods are interacting with microbes, which are interacting with our own immune system and gut lining. They are all in an orchestra, producing different things like metabolites and hopefully working together. Those metabolites can be absorbed and travel to different places in the body, like the brain, and have beneficial anti-inflammatory effects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The gut-brain connection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mounting evidence connects the health of the gut microbiome and Alzheimer's disease. In his book, "Heal Your Gut, Save Your Brain," Partha Nandi, M.D., FACP, suggests gut care could drastically alter and transform the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By targeting gut health, these patients and their families may have another means to address Alzheimer's with simple, effective principles that can impact the development of this neurodegenerative disease," Nandi writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many ongoing studies are examining the link between gut health and cognitive decline, Uchida says. "People are looking at models, oftentimes using animals, to study if we modulate their diet and see less incidence of the 'mouse version' of dementia or this neuroinflammation that we think might predispose or eventually lead to things like dementia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Uchida's colleagues during her fellowship at Massachusetts General Hospital is directing clinical investigations at Harvard Medical School into how the brain and gut communicate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trisha Pasricha, M.D., a specialist in neurogastroenterology, focuses on gut health's connection to Parkinson's disease. In 2024, her lab published findings showing that damage to the upper lining of the gut was associated with about a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2823250?resultClick=3" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;76% increased risk of developing Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a video released in December 2024, Pasricha said the goal of her lab's research "is to find an early biomarker of Parkinson's disease, and our hope is that we can find one in the gut."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She suggests it might be possible in the future to "Get your screening colonoscopy and be told that there is a sign you will progress to Parkinson's disease unless doctors intervene now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the center of Pasricha's research is the vast nervous system in people's guts, which can set off a variety of connections with the brain. In fact, the gut has often been referred to as a second brain — and there's a simple reason why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The second most abundant location for nerves, outside of the central nervous system in the brain and spinal cord, is the gut," Uchida says. "I think that resonates with people when they think about simple things like where they feel emotions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also points out that "The nerve endings in the gut are right there with the immune system in the gut. They are talking to each other, and that's why researchers are using basic science to try and understand these relationships."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Poligoone/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Improving health through research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uchida is in the midst of conducting clinical research at U of U Health into the link between gut health and its impact on allergic diseases like eosinophilic gastrointestinal (GI) disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Both conditions can lead to severe abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting and difficulty swallowing in patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In support of this kind of research, the University of Utah is also home to the Microbiota and Gastrointestinal Immunology Consortium (&lt;a href="https://www.magic.path.utah.edu/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;MAGIC&lt;/a&gt;), a leading hub for microbiome research. MAGIC brings together experts across disciplines to better understand how microbial communities influence human health and disease — from chronic illness to brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will take time, funding, and the support of the public for researchers like Uchida, Pasricha, and Nandi to make the best connections between gut health and a longer and healthier lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the big messages that I hope to get across is that as a society, we really need to value science so that we can get better information and care for our patient population," Uchida says. "We continue to try our hardest and push forward to provide them with the best care possible by bringing together our clinical knowledge with new high-quality research."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opinions and conclusions expressed in this article are the sponsor's own and do not reflect the views or opinions of KSL.com.

Importantly, these benefits disappeared when Bacteroides were absent, confirming that both the chemical and microbial conditions are needed for the effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AceCel + Bacteroides:&lt;/strong&gt; Weight loss effects only occur when acetate reaches the colon &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Bacteroides species are present.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metabolic Shift:&lt;/strong&gt; Promotes fat-burning over sugar-burning, similar to fasting or keto.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gut-Driven Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt; Bacteria ferment more carbs, reducing sugar absorption and liver fat storage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;RIKEN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers led by Hiroshi Ohno at the RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences (IMS) in Japan have discovered a new way to reduce obesity. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their study shows that supplying the gut with extra acetate reduces fat and liver mass in both normal and obese mice, as long as bacteria of the &lt;em&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/em&gt; species is also present in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110163"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/acetate-microbiome-weight-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/acetate-microbiome-weight-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/acetate-microbiome-weight-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/acetate-microbiome-weight-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/acetate-microbiome-weight-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/acetate-microbiome-weight-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/acetate-microbiome-weight-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/acetate-microbiome-weight-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a person on a scale." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/acetate-microbiome-weight-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/acetate-microbiome-weight-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/acetate-microbiome-weight-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/acetate-microbiome-weight-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/acetate-microbiome-weight-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/acetate-microbiome-weight-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/acetate-microbiome-weight-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;By eliminating the sugars, fat-derived energy is promoted and less sugar is stored as glycogen in the liver, thus explaining how obesity is reduced. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When both these conditions are met, gut bacteria can eliminate more sugars from the gut and promote the burning of fats for energy in the host.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were published in the scientific journal &lt;em&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affecting hundreds of millions of people around the world, obesity constitutes a global epidemic. It is linked to eating too much sugar and starchy foods and is known to increase the risk of heart disease, type-2 diabetes, and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, studies show that eating fiber reduces the risk of the these very same diseases—even though it cannot be digested directly by mammals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When fiber reaches your gut—the large intestine to be precise—it is fermented by bacteria and the byproducts are released into the gut lumen, with some of them making it into the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common of these byproducts is acetate, which is known to have some beneficial effects on host metabolism. Although this makes dietary fiber a good “prebiotic”, individual variation in the production of acetate and other useful byproducts limits its efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get around this problem, Ohno and his team previously developed a kind of acetate supplement by combining it with cellulose. AceCel ensures acetate reaches the distal large intestine where it can work its magic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the team investigated how AceCel affects mouse metabolism and the composition of gut bacteria. They found that when given AceCel, both normal and obese mice lost weight without losing muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was not true for other short-chain fatty-acid byproducts, meaning that acetate itself is the key. Further tests were designed to figure out how this was happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They next discovered that compared with mice on a normal diet, when AceCel-fed mice were resting, they generated more energy from burning liver fat and less from burning carbohydrates. This is similar to what happens when fasting or on a low carb, keto diet, and promotes weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypothesizing that the effects on the gut microbiome would also be similar, they analyzed the gut microbiota, finding that eating AceCel led mice to have more &lt;em&gt;Bacteroide&lt;/em&gt;s bacteria in their guts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then tested AceCel in mice that had controlled gut microbiota: either no bacteria at all, or one of several &lt;em&gt;Bacteroide&lt;/em&gt;s species. They found that AceCel had no effect on body, liver, or fat mass in the gut-bacteria free mice, while three &lt;em&gt;Bacteroide&lt;/em&gt;s species had similar positive effects on each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that the specific combination of acetate and &lt;em&gt;Bacteroide&lt;/em&gt;s bacteria in the intestines is necessary for the observed weight loss to occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digging deeper, they found that this combination leads to more fermentation of carbohydrates in the gut, meaning that there is less sugar available for the host to process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By eliminating the sugars, fat-derived energy is promoted and less sugar is stored as glycogen in the liver, thus explaining how obesity is reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Developing a treatment or prevention strategy for obesity is an urgent issue that must be solved quickly,” says Ohno.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that acetylated cellulose can prevent obesity by modulating the function of the gut microbiome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our next step is to confirm the safety and efficacy of using acetylated cellulose to treat obesity in humans. If so, it could become an important ingredient in functional foods that prevent obesity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this obesity research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#80e1e4e1edaef0e8e9ecece9f0f3c0f2e9ebe5eeaeeaf0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Adam Phillips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://riken.jp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;RIKEN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Adam Phillips – RIKEN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2025.04.013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Acetylated cellulose suppresses body mass gain through gut commensals consuming host-accessible carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt;” by Hiroshi Ohno et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acetylated cellulose suppresses body mass gain through gut commensals consuming host-accessible carbohydrates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective approaches to preventing and treating obesity are urgently needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although current strategies primarily focus on direct modulation of host metabolism, another promising approach may involve limiting nutrient availability through regulation of the gut microbiota, which links diet and host physiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we report that acetylated cellulose (AceCel), which markedly alters gut bacterial composition and function, reduces body mass gain in both wild-type and obese mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AceCel limits carbohydrate oxidation and promotes fatty acid oxidation in the host liver in a microbiota-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We further show that acetate enhances carbohydrate fermentation by the gut commensal &lt;em&gt;Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron&lt;/em&gt;, depleting host-accessible simple sugars in the gut of AceCel-fed mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight the potential of AceCel as a prebiotic that regulates carbohydrate metabolism in both bacteria and host, offering promise as a therapeutic strategy for obesity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 13:47:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE1JSHAwNXNyT0lySzBtd1g4VFA5Mm1Ec0ZFazdIU1pvUW05b0FxMXdsTGxGRm5VeXNEaFl2a2tIYmZjQmVReHd6VDRGYnZQdEM5WjdabGtpOTdmWGs1TElYZU1nUVA4U2RId1VwZGc0SQ</guid></item><item><title>检查衰老程度的DIY指南-对话 | The DIY guide to checking how well you’re ageing - The Conversation</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxQMnJ0UjFhUVM5aG9NbVpGRkZDNUlBVHVnbVFoak1MZXozaFMxa3ZleFJ3MjZtZ2RvdV9mU085Wm1CajYyOG94VmFzNlFSeFVGZ2xYQk1fYW8zbnBDU2hydkR0NHhoRXdvdXAxTWNxdGowMmlKMDZoYzAyd0dGSnAyUW5nOV9BZDRWOEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few years ago, a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@danierachel88/video/7217612858568281350"&gt;social media trend&lt;/a&gt; challenged people to see if they could stand up from the floor without using their hands. Now, it’s all about how long you can &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/ability-balance-one-leg-predict-neuromuscular-aging-study"&gt;balance on one leg&lt;/a&gt; while brushing your teeth. These quirky “tests” promise to tell us how well we’re ageing – but do they really?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we talk about “ageing well”, we’re usually referring to both physical and psychological wellbeing. That includes feeling good (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/hedonic-well-being"&gt;hedonic wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;) and finding meaning and purpose (&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-94-007-0753-5_929"&gt;eudaimonic wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;). Engaging in activities and monitoring ourselves plays a role in both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But ageing &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article/64/10/gnae102/7731211"&gt;isn’t just about&lt;/a&gt; how strong your grip is or how fast you can walk. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2024/02/28/beyond-longevity-what-are-the-indicators-of-successful-aging"&gt;a complex mix&lt;/a&gt; of physical, cognitive, emotional and social changes – and no single test captures the whole picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physically, one simple measure that gets a lot of attention is walking speed. According to &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d7679"&gt;one famous study&lt;/a&gt;, people who walk faster than 1.32 metres per second were less likely to die in the next three years – jokingly framed as “too fast for the Grim Reaper to catch”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, a slower walking speed – below 0.8 metres per second – can be a &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/am-i-too-old-to-build-muscle-what-science-says-about-sarcopenia-and-building-strength-later-in-life-203562"&gt;sign of sarcopenia&lt;/a&gt;, a condition involving reduced muscle mass, muscle strength and physical function. These are all important indicators of age-related decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while these markers are useful, they’re not easy to measure at home. Most research relies on specialist equipment and your local GP probably doesn’t have a grip-strength dynamometer sitting in a drawer. But they could time &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jPl-IuRJ5A"&gt;how long it takes you to stand up and sit down five times from a chair&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to do a DIY MOT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what can you realistically do to track your own ageing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To truly understand how you’re ageing, it helps to think beyond physical health. Mental sharpness, emotional resilience and social connection matter just as much. One helpful idea is to assess your cognitive fitness, which includes skills like attention, memory and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some cognitive tests you can try at home:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/trail-making-test"&gt;Trail making test&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; connect numbers and letters in sequence (1, A, 2, B, etc.) and time how long it takes. This measures your ability to switch between tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5388755/"&gt;Stroop task&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; challenges your ability to ignore competing information. Try saying the colour of a word, not the word itself – like saying “red” when you see the word “blue” printed in red ink. It’s harder than it sounds!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aging-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.589299/full"&gt;Dual-task challenge&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; walk at your normal speed while counting backwards from 100 in threes. If your walking speed changes significantly, it could indicate cognitive strain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These kinds of tasks test how well your brain handles competing demands – a key ability that becomes even more important as we age. This skill is known as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5414037/"&gt;cognitive flexibility&lt;/a&gt;, and it helps you adapt to changing situations, switch between tasks and manage distractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying out these tests is great, but how do you know if you’re improving? After all, when you have spent time trying to improve your walking speed, or Stroop ability – or even rubbing your head, patting your belly while saying the Finnish alphabet out loud – it’s important to know if you are seeing benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some measures, like single-leg stance, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/ability-balance-one-leg-predict-neuromuscular-aging-study"&gt;can vary&lt;/a&gt; wildly from day to day – or even hour to hour. You might get better just from repeating it, which doesn’t necessarily mean you’re ageing better, just that you’ve practised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-strong-your-grip-is-says-a-lot-about-your-health-145861"&gt;like grip strength&lt;/a&gt;, change very slowly even with regular strength training. And some improvements are task-specific: getting better at the trail making test doesn’t necessarily make you sharper at doing Wordle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why it helps to complete the test a few times at the start, then retest yourself once a month or so – again, doing it a couple of times – to track any improvements. Cognitive changes may be slower to notice than physical ones, so regular checks can help reveal progress over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;More of a puzzle than a test&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no single test or score that can capture how well you’re ageing. Think of it more like a jigsaw puzzle. Physical health, mental agility, emotional balance, social connection – &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027795362500262X"&gt;they all matter&lt;/a&gt;, and they all interact. And, of course, even if you perform well now, some changes in the future may be beyond your control. No test can fully predict what lies ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, maybe the best sign of ageing well isn’t how fast you walk or how long you can stand on one leg – it’s how you feel about your life. Are you feeling engaged, content, connected?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools like the &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-90-481-2354-4_12"&gt;Scale of Positive and Negative Experience&lt;/a&gt; can help you take stock of your emotional wellbeing. This short, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-021-00420-2"&gt;12-question survey&lt;/a&gt; asks about your everyday feelings – from joy and calm to sadness and frustration – offering &lt;a href="https://aging.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1131/2021/06/Eudaimonic-and-Hedonic-Well-Being.pdf"&gt;insight into both&lt;/a&gt; the pleasurable (hedonic) and meaningful (eudaimonic) sides of wellbeing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ageing well isn’t about beating a stopwatch or acing a memory test. It’s about knowing yourself – your body, your mind and your values – and making small, meaningful changes that help you feel more you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, go ahead, stand on one leg if you like. But don’t forget to check in with your brain, body, emotions and your sense of purpose too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

It may also be linked to death from heart disease and cancer, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/sitting/faq-20058005" target="_blank"&gt;according to Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But a lesser known side effect of sitting all day is that it can impact the muscles throughout your body almost immediately. One example is a change to your glutes known colloquially as "dead butt syndrome."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dead butt syndrome, also known as lower cross syndrome, gluteal amnesia or gluteus medius tendinosis, is when the gluteus medius muscle — one of the three main muscles in the buttocks — becomes weaker due to sitting for prolonged periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Your glutes are crucial to numerous every day activities, so it's worthwhile to fight dead butt syndrome as much as you can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Trainer tip of the day: The No. 1 sign of dead butt syndrome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"You may have even felt (dead butt syndrome) happening: After a few hours in a seated position, you stand up and feel a pain or numbness in your backside. It can even advance further causing hip and &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/best-back-exercises-rcna15394" target="_blank"&gt;back pain&lt;/a&gt;," TODAY contributor and personal trainer Steph Mansour &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/dead-butt-syndrome-5-exercises-help-activate-your-glutes-t210476" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;To combat dead butt syndrome, it's important to stand up and walk throughout the day and to perform movements that activate the glute muscles, such as glute bridges, crab walks and donkey kicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Why it matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The glute muscles are important to many every day movements, like hip extensions, standing upright, walking and climbing stairs, Mansour explained. The gluteus medius in particular helps stabilize the hip joint and facilitates pelvic rotation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Without sufficiently using this muscle, you can develop dead butt syndrome, leading to weaker glutes and a smaller range of motion in the hips. It can also make squats and other exercises targeting your glutes less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Tips to get started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Try getting up and walking around once every hour or going up and down a flight of stairs.

Like your diet, you have less room to move so you can't skip your skincare'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm genuinely really surprised when people think I'm younger than I am,' Patsy says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If I'm training a class and people guess my age they often say, "Wow, that's so cool, I want to be like you when I'm 50." But it's not just how I look, it's that fact that I'm still training and am energised that's inspiring.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rather than dreading getting older, Patsy embraces each passing year, especially since losing her two sisters, who died aged 48 and 55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For me, having lost loved ones around my age has really changed my perspective on life,' she explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I now enjoy life, I want to stay healthy, and be here for my kids. I know you can't guarantee those things, but I just know by prioritising my own health I'm giving myself the best chance of that.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox mol-style-medium"&gt;NON-NEGOTIABLES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To keep looking young, Patsy's non-negotiables include wearing SPF sunscreen, regardless of the weather, and drinking two litres of water a day.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has been obsessed with fitness since the age of 18 and exercises daily, but admits she has slowed down in recent years&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'I'm genuinely really surprised when people think I'm younger than I am,' Patsy says &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Having young friends in their 30s also motivates Patsy to take care of her body and health (pictured on the right in 2020)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm in the gym five days a week, and do a mix of strength training, weights and cardio. I go for a leisurely walk two or three times a week,' she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I love having something to train for too like a fun run - something with a competitive element to it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to staying active, she eats 'all the right things' to fuel her body with enough protein and fibre to stay lean, but insists she 'doesn't obsess over it'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As we age, we have less room to move and can't bounce back as easily, so I don't diet as such. I just ensure I maintain a well-balanced diet 90 per cent of the time,' Patsy says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patsy begins her day at  5am with a coffee and a run with friends, followed by a protein shake then overnight oats for breakfast. Lunch is often leftovers and dinner is 'meat and three veg'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it's important to maintain a healthy diet and exercise every day, Patsy says to not underestimate the power of your mind when it comes to ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You do come into your own once you're in your 50s because you don't care about what anyone else thinks, which is a really powerful thing,' she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patsy also prioritises sleep 'above everything else'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, she is 'obsessed' with getting more than eight hours of shut-eye and monitors her sleep with her WHOOP wristband, a fitness device that continuously tracks your physiological data, including heart rate, sleep and stress levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As she gets older, the main difference Patsy has noticed is changes to the texture and elasticity of her skin. As a result, she always wears SPF, opts for only light makeup and never skips skincare&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatLHS femail" data-version="2" id="mol-77db6b40-313d-11f0-b41f-5fe562becc42" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/beauty/article-14713781/Beauty-secrets-50-look-35.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;PATSY'S DAY ON A PLATE&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox"&gt;5am -&lt;/span&gt; Wake up and make a coffee before meeting some friends for hill sprints&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Post-workout protein shake &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox"&gt;Breakfast: &lt;/span&gt;Oats with Greek yoghurt berries, honey and granola&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox"&gt;Early lunch: &lt;/span&gt;often leftovers such as cottage pie but made with sweet potato instead of pastry, mince and veggies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox"&gt;Dinner:&lt;/span&gt; Keeping it basic with a meat and three veg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox"&gt;Snack: &lt;/span&gt;Biscuits or fruit &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox"&gt;Water: &lt;/span&gt;More than two litres throughout the day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox"&gt;Evening: &lt;/span&gt;AgeMate NMN supplement for longevity and a magnesium supplement to help with sleep&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatLHS femail" data-version="2" id="mol-77db9250-313d-11f0-b41f-5fe562becc42" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/beauty/article-14713781/Beauty-secrets-50-look-35.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;PATSY'S SKINCARE ROUTINE&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patsy admits her skincare routine 'isn't extensive' but she always wears SPF 50+ daily and a hat when she's outside &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the morning she cleanses her face then applies a layer of moisturiser &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her favourite brand is Zoë Foster Blake's GoTo and she uses the Nifty Fifty SPF &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the evening, she cleanses her face to remove any makeup, dirt and sweat from the day before applying an AHA mask from Dr Naomi's One Night Stand &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once a week she uses her LED mask and has facials on occasion. A couple times a year she gets Botox&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox mol-style-medium"&gt;Nikki Ellis - 58&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At 58, Melbourne mum Nikki Ellis looks closer to 30 than 60. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it's considered impolite to ask a woman how old she is, Nikki doesn't mind and is happy to answer questions about what she eats, how she trains and the products she uses to maintain her youthful complexion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For Nikki, the 'unsexy stuff' is the secret to looking 30 in your 50s and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Lift the weights, eat the protein, go to bed early, wear the SPF. But when you do it with intention and joy? That's when it becomes magic,' Nikki tells me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she turned 50, Nikki says she was 'ridiculously devastated' but her mindset shifted when she considered the death of her mother. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I see ageing as a privilege, and one that not everyone gets. My own mother died at 51 so I am always aware how lucky we are to grow old,' she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But I am invested in ageing well, which to me means staying strong, sharp, and joyful for as long as I can.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nikki Ellis, from Melbourne, is two years shy of 60 but many assume she is in her early 30s &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nikki lifts weights three to four times a week. This helps maintain her strength, keeps her bones dense and provides mental clarity needed to run her business&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox mol-style-medium"&gt;DIET AND EXERCISE&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nikki lifts weights three to four times a week, explaining that resistance training is one of her 'non-negotiables'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This helps to maintain her strength, keeps her bones dense and provides the mental clarity needed to run her business. She also manages to clock up 10,000 steps a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Importantly, this routine is drastically different to how she used to work out in her 30s when she was hyper-focused on pushing herself as hard as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I did a lot more cardio back then - spin classes, long runs, rowing and lots of aerobics classes,' Nikki says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I thought working out meant being drenched in sweat and completely exhausted. I wasn't lifting nearly enough for my health or hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's probably my biggest "what I wish I knew then" moment. Although I was still lifting weights back then, I could have had more focus on lifting heavy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When it comes to her diet, she eats 100g of protein daily, has lots of fibre and starts her day with a high-protein smoothie at 4.30am. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nikki doesn't eat processed meats, such as ham or salami, and avoids sugar and foods that generally make her feel 'foggy or bloated'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nikki swears by 'consistent, progressive resistance training'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the 'best decisions' she ever made was giving up alcohol three years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She noticed her skin, energy levels, sleep and workouts all improved since cutting out drinking; however, she still enjoys a non-alcoholic gin and tonic on occasion.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After being diagnosed with a melanoma five years ago, she is also 'super careful' with how much time she spends in the sun and always wears SPF. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Plus she has a great social network and spends time with friends and family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I also need to include having something fun to look forward to - like a trip or a holiday,' she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nikki does confess to having 'anti-wrinkle injections' like Botox every three months and a facial every four weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At night, she sleeps on a silk pillowcase as the smooth texture is believed to reduce friction and the appearance of sleep creases on the skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After being diagnosed with a melanoma five years ago, she's 'super careful' with how much time she spends in the sun and always wears SPF (pictured left at age 30, and right at 57)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I see all these teenagers buying 12-step skincare routines for anti-ageing, and I wish I could shout from the rooftops to wear sunscreen daily!' Taryn says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sydney mother Taryn Gray (pictured) has used sunscreen every single day since she was 17&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What most people don't realise is the skin is your body's largest organ and the ingredients that you use matter. What you put on your skin can potentially impact its function and appearance, just as what you put in your body does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Choosing high-quality, non-toxic ingredients can support both the health and appearance of your skin and your overall well-being. I love the concept and products of Edible Beauty Australia; I am really enjoying trying their range.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Taryn found it hard going to the gym in her mid-30s while juggling work and children, but her husband helped by converting their garage into a workout haven complete with a cross trainer, free weights and TV for streaming yoga and Pilates classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now that her twins are 13, she has more time to focus on her fitness and wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three years ago, Taryn made the decision to stop eating meat, mainly for ethical reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While she may be pushing 50, Taryn (right) has never felt better or more energised and doesn't look a day over 35&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Now that her twins are 13, she has more time to focus on fitness (pictured in her 30s) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox femail" data-version="2" id="mol-7607c930-31ec-11f0-a25d-3190792c5a03" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/beauty/article-14713781/Beauty-secrets-50-look-35.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;WHAT CAUSES AGEING SKIN&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Inflammation:&lt;/span&gt; Chronic inflammation, whether triggered by internal factors or external aggressors, can accelerate skin ageing by breaking down collagen and elastin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Free radicals:&lt;/span&gt; These unstable molecules damage skin cells and their structural components through oxidation. Generated by factors like sun exposure, pollution and smoking, free radicals can compromise the skin's protective barrier via oxidation, a process visually similar to how a cut apple or avocado turns brown upon exposure to air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Sun and blue light exposure: &lt;/span&gt;UV radiation from the sun is the primary external aggressor, causing photoageing (wrinkles, sunspots, loss of elasticity). Blue light, emitted from electronic devices, is also increasingly being recognised for its potential to contribute to oxidative stress and pigmentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Pollution or environmental toxins: &lt;/span&gt;Exposure to air pollution and other environmental toxins introduces harmful particles to the skin that can generate free radicals, trigger inflammation, and impair the skin barrier function. This category also includes potentially irritating or harmful ingredients found in some skincare formulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Stress&lt;/span&gt;: Chronic stress can impact the skin through hormonal changes and increased inflammation, potentially leading to breakouts, increased sensitivity, and accelerated aging signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Smoking or vaping:&lt;/span&gt; The chemicals in cigarette smoke and vaping products generate a significant number of free radicals and impair blood flow to the skin, leading to premature wrinkles, dullness and a leathery texture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Source: Taryn Gray &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for her exercise routine, Taryn aims to move her body daily but no longer focuses on strenuous exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Exercise is essential, but I no longer put pressure on myself. I find the flow of movement is more natural now, driven by motivation to age and move well into my later years,' Taryn explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My focus is around the overall wellness of exercise, stretching, movement and mental health. Fresh air, salt water, connecting with friends, keeping our poodle Chester happy. And of course, our no-excuses, no-membership rain, hail or shine garage workout space.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the name of balance, Taryn still enjoys the occasional wine - in fact, she describes herself as a 'wine connoisseur in the making'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Visiting wineries is a fun hobby where I enjoy learning about the different aromas, flavours and the entire winemaking process,' Taryn says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Personally, I enjoy wine in moderation as part of a balanced lifestyle. I also enjoy a month-long stint of no alcohol each year.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 13:24:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxPamh5b2p3MU5nNVlLamtJUWpzVkxXZWxXZVlKa0xJMENxc0YxTFVYNno4RzZldGxPX0lpQ0xlTGJiZ1NXZmtsYjgwLWdrWXFjT05maEhTcmU1dlI1cXpDUms2Ui1Mek4tU0twY2pQd2g1cUVETXdvT3BPY09kTFNlVkk4aGVuSDQ0Rzg5VnJYT3RTZ00</guid></item><item><title>大量研究揭示痛风从何而来，而不是我们所想的那样- ScienceAlert | Huge Study Reveals Where Gout Comes From, And It's Not What We Thought - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxPQ1lZLXBkOTcxdWphZF90dDdBMkpaTUtLMnYyYnhhakdLd0hTRlpZc0lZME1OV0VjY3k5N2RaMUU3b3VFU0E1SHlvR0ZHalU5SlV0bVB6c05DYklZY0ZFMExBT1Q1b0l0ZWNpNGdTdHc0ekhyRUpYSk04YWZUU05iSjZUM0t3TWZjaHl5eGtvU0VyREVlYk1XTXdnSWRyUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Gout is often associated with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alcohol-can-trigger-serious-cardiac-effects-in-young-people"&gt;drinking too much&lt;/a&gt; or not eating healthily enough, but research suggests genetics play more of a factor in developing the arthritic condition than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent study, carried out by an international team of scientists, looked at genetic data collected from 2.6 million people across 13 different cohorts of DNA data. That number included 120,295 people with "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-024-01921-5"&gt;prevalent gout&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparing the genetic codes of the people with gout against the people without, the team found 377 specific &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"&gt;DNA regions&lt;/a&gt; where there were variations specific to having the condition – 149 of which hadn't been previously linked to gout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While lifestyle and environmental factors are certainly still in play, the findings suggest genetics play a major role in determining whether or not someone gets gout – and the researchers think there may be more undiscovered genetic links still to be found, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of the research;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lY77PhQV-vE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gout is a chronic disease with a genetic basis and is not the fault of the sufferer – the myth that gout is caused by lifestyle or diet needs to be busted," &lt;a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/news/newsroom/study-busts-myths-about-cause-of-gout"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist Tony Merriman from the University of Otago in New Zealand, when the study was published last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gout/"&gt;Gout takes hold&lt;/a&gt; when there are high levels of uric acid in the blood, which then form sharp crystal needles in the joints. When the body's immune system starts to attack those crystals, it leads to significant pain and discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetics is important in every stage of that process, the researchers suggest. Particularly, it affects the likelihood of the body's immune system attacking the crystals, and in the way &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uric_acid"&gt;uric acid&lt;/a&gt; is transported around the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p_Zt95_TLmA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gout can come and go, but there are treatments available – and the authors behind the study think misconceptions can put people off getting those treatments. That's a real problem with cases of the condition &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrrheum.2015.91"&gt;rising and rising&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This widespread myth causes shame in people with gout, making some people more likely to suffer in silence and not go and see the doctor to get a preventive drug that lowers urate in the blood and will prevent their pain," &lt;a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/news/newsroom/study-busts-myths-about-cause-of-gout"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Merriman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of giving us a better understanding of the causes of gout, the study gives scientists more options to explore when it comes to treatments, particularly in terms of managing the body's immune response to the build up of uric acid. In fact, existing drugs could be repurposed for this job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_151682" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-151682" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Gichtfuss_im_Roentgenbild_002-642x693.png" alt="Huge Study Shows Where Gout Comes From, And It Isn't What We Thought" class="size-medium wp-image-151682" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Gichtfuss_im_Roentgenbild_002-642x693.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Gichtfuss_im_Roentgenbild_002-385x415.png 385w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Gichtfuss_im_Roentgenbild_002-768x828.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Gichtfuss_im_Roentgenbild_002-600x647.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Gichtfuss_im_Roentgenbild_002.png 1016w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-151682" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Gout on X-rays of a left foot in the metatarsal-phalangeal joint of the big toe.

Nevertheless, it gives us a much better sense of a health problem that's been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diseases-dickens-might-find-familiar-are-making-a-comeback-following-uk-s-austerity"&gt;afflicting people for centuries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We hope that, in time, better and more accessible treatments will become available with the new targets we identified," &lt;a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/news/newsroom/study-busts-myths-about-cause-of-gout"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Merriman. "Gout deserves more health spend resource and greater prioritization in the health system."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-024-01921-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Genetics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in November 2024. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A new study reveals that male mice can determine the social rank of unfamiliar opponents using airborne odors and physical scent cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a tunnel confrontation test, mice either retreated or stood their ground depending on how they assessed the other mouse’s status relative to their own. Disabling both the olfactory and vomeronasal systems eliminated this ability, but knocking out just one did not, showing the systems compensate for each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Sensory Systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice use both olfactory (airborne) and vomeronasal (contact-based) cues to assess social status.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Processing:&lt;/strong&gt; Social rank isn’t based on fixed behavior but inferred through real-time sensory integration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Parallel:&lt;/strong&gt; Like mice, humans gauge social status of unfamiliar individuals using available sensory cues, especially in unfamiliar social settings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Francis Crick Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like many mammals, mice live in a social hierarchy where some are more dominant than others. This helps to avoid conflict and establish breeding partners.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested previously that some mice might display fixed behaviour regardless of who they are interacting with, or that physical properties can give cues about social ranking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110151"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sensory-social-hierarchy-neuroscincec.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sensory-social-hierarchy-neuroscincec-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sensory-social-hierarchy-neuroscincec-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sensory-social-hierarchy-neuroscincec-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sensory-social-hierarchy-neuroscincec-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sensory-social-hierarchy-neuroscincec-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sensory-social-hierarchy-neuroscincec-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sensory-social-hierarchy-neuroscincec.jpg" alt="This shows people and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sensory-social-hierarchy-neuroscincec.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sensory-social-hierarchy-neuroscincec-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sensory-social-hierarchy-neuroscincec-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sensory-social-hierarchy-neuroscincec-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sensory-social-hierarchy-neuroscincec-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sensory-social-hierarchy-neuroscincec-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sensory-social-hierarchy-neuroscincec-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;They found that the strangers could recognise each other’s rank, compare it to their own, and either retreat or force the other mouse to retreat. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, new research published today in &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt; shows that mice instead infer an unfamiliar mouse’s rank through chemical cues transmitted in the air (odours) or through direct contact (non-volatile scent cues).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Crick team worked this out using a test where male mice enter a transparent tube at opposite ends, meeting in the middle. In this type of confrontation, a more submissive animal will typically retreat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers first looked at interactions in mice who shared the same cage, using this to rank each mouse on a hierarchy, before observing how the mice responded to a set of unfamiliar opponents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that the strangers could recognise each other’s rank, compare it to their own, and either retreat or force the other mouse to retreat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then tested the mice in the dark, finding that this did not affect rank recognition, suggesting that cues like physical size or behaviour don’t determine recognition of a more aggressive opponent. Similarly, castrating the mice to remove their sex hormones had no impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the team experimentally blocked the two chemosensory systems that mice use – one for odours in the air (olfactory system) and one for chemical signals transmitted by physical contact (vomeronasal system).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found no effect when just one of these systems was removed; both needed to be ablated before the mice couldn’t recognise opponent rank. This showed that mice use both olfactory and vomeronasal systems to recognise rank and can compensate if one is missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like mice, people can also infer the social status of others around them relative to their own, also using sensory cues, including language, facial expression or clothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step for the researchers is to investigate which areas of the brain process the information on opponent rank and own rank and initiate a decision to retreat or advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neven Borak, former PhD student in the State-Dependent Neural Processing Laboratory at the Crick and first author, said: “We’ve shown that mice weigh up strangers using chemical cues and can detect social status without needing an extensive history of confrontations with those specific opponents. This is a fascinating phenomenon that humans do too mostly using visual cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work offers an interesting perspective on social mobility: humans, like mice, can enter a new group of people but still maintain understanding of own social rank and gauge the social status of unfamiliar people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonny Kohl, Group Leader of the State-Dependent Neural Processing Laboratory at the Crick and senior author, said: “We’ve shown for the first time how mice integrate internal and external information about dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This shows that a decision based on relative ranks is made in the brain before mice show either aggression or submissive behaviour, rather than there being fixed differences in behaviours leading to an aggressive or docile mouse.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The State-Dependent Neural Processing Laboratory studies how processes within the brain are impacted by the state of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By studying how physiological states, such as pregnancy, stress or sleep, impact neural circuits in mice, the researchers hope to advance a more integrative view of brain physiology in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sensory and social neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#adcec1ccdfc883cadfc8c8c3edcedfc4cec683ccce83d8c6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Clare Green&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://crick.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Francis Crick Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Clare Green – Francis Crick Institute&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2025.04.063" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dominance rank inference in mice via chemosensation&lt;/a&gt;” by Neven Borak et al. &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dominance rank inference in mice via chemosensation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social dominance hierarchies enable efficient resource allocation and conflict avoidance in animal communities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals can determine their relative status by tracking previous conflict outcomes, as seen in aggression training and the winner effect, where successive wins increase the likelihood of future victories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeated optogenetic stimulation of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) results in lasting rank increases, suggesting that social rank is derived as a statistic of past outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, relative rank could be assessed more efficiently by incorporating information about an opponent’s dominance status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pheromone signals, such as darcin, are enriched in the urine of dominant individuals, suggesting that hierarchical behavior may integrate information about both own and opponent rank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although prior studies have explored the learning and neural representation of own rank, how opponent rank is detected and encoded remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we address this question in male mice using a tube test assay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show that stable hierarchies do not rely on fixed behavioral traits and that mice can infer the rank of unfamiliar opponents by detecting scalable chemosensory rank cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensory ablation experiments reveal that both olfactory and vomeronasal cues are sufficient for rank assessment. Male mice thus use chemosensory signals to infer dominance status during social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 12:38:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTFBMWEdzTDBUcmpSaEVmc1ZUS1Z3Vzl4Z2otYjNzSkY0SktvREV4b3NhY2JBRTNLSVlqX2VIQjQwVGpzUWhzWGRLalN2T2xjTlFOUVd5UktCendMT1RoNzhadWMzeTNDOEtuU2MyWXlLOTBwWEtRZHo4U2VCcw</guid></item><item><title>做过根管治疗吗？口腔健康状况不佳的人常见的5种严重疾病-印度时报 | Got a root canal treatment done? 5 serious conditions commonly found in people with poor oral health - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAJBVV95cUxPUDFDS2lDYXJ1UkxLaVV2MlJkcUhrNFhrNmR1d2ZsN1htTU9TUTRtVGx2c3MzWkdBMXhXaElMZXdaNExvdVcxRVZicEJfcl9Ka0ZiMGVNc01qTmpXWWlJSlY1OTgyQzJxTkdvTng2R1Y5SXU1QlJGWlpTblVhdDhHYmhmOHNPT0RRSjdSU2FEWU8teUhYUVZNdFZzMmFQSU8yQkNVZnRBTzBqOUEwX3hQa3lyX3RQbDdNbmM2enBzdmVoUERENHk0U21qbUJJaVExODk3dThQR3JBUUV0UVZIY2VtR0NKNGdKVTNTaFp3Yk53cFVCOUtfOFdER2xSUXN2SUdUT0xWNFdaX3hBakctOVRlVGhucU5zVDFZZkVKRVhYR3hf?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A root canal, also known as endodontic therapy, is a dental procedure used to treat infection or damage inside a tooth. This treatment is often needed when the pulp, the soft tissue inside the tooth that contains nerves and blood vessels, becomes inflamed or infected due to deep decay, repeated dental procedures, or a crack or chip in the tooth. The requirement for this treatment often stems from poor oral health. &lt;br&gt;If not treated, poor oral health, especially gum disease, can lead to serious medical conditions that can impact quality of life and longevity. From heart disease to cognitive decline, here are five serious health conditions commonly linked to poor oral

itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A dietitian has urged the public to seek help if they find themselves coughing after a meal — as it could be a sign of a condition that can dramatically increase the risk of deadly &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-1e922310-3568-11f0-8cfe-4d72ebc099bc"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clearing your throat after food is a little-known symptom of &lt;span&gt;'silent reflux', which happens when stomach acid leaks backwards towards the throat or even lungs, causing irritation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike the more common form of acid reflux, the 'silent' type doesn't always involve the telltale burning sensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, it entails frequent throat clearing, coughing after eating, hoarseness and the sensation of a lump in the throat.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, &lt;/span&gt;Molly Pelletier, an expert in nutrition, has taken to Instagram to warn of the dangers of leaving the little-known condition untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DI1IknzJ-_B/?igsh=YzZ6N2p1aTNxM3ox"&gt;video &lt;/a&gt;that has so far been viewed over 8.6million times, she urged patients not to dismiss a cough as 'just reflux'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Your throat is trying to protect itself [from damage],' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Silent reflux, known medically as laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), is thought to affect around &lt;span&gt;one in four people in the UK, and typically involves the stomach acid travelling further up the food pipe to the throat than traditional acid reflux.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The nutritionist explained that coughing after eating a meal can be a sign of something more serious than 'just acid reflux', increasing the risk of chronic asthma, sinus infections and even gastrointestinal cancers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; Studies have shown that suffering acid reflux for several years can increase the risk of throat, oesophageal and thyroid cancers by &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10557881/"&gt;at least two-fold&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The constant flow of stomach acid in the throat is thought to irritate the cells lining the throat which can lead to mutations that trigger the formation of cancerous tumours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have also shown that almost 28 per cent of people with laryngeal cancer suffered with acid reflux. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Pelletier explained: 'When acid irritates your larynx [voice box], it triggers you body's natural defense: a cough reflex.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Pelletier suggested trying to avoid excessive throat clearing, which can irritate the lining of the throat further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Avoiding eating two to three hours before bed, reducing acidic foods and addressing stress can also alleviate symptoms and therefore the risk of cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Focus on calm, unhurried meals and chewing food well,' the expert advised. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As well as acidic foods, like citrus fruits, vinegar and tomatoes, the dietitian also advised limiting carbonated drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Symptoms of LPR include a sensation of a lump in the throat, hoarseness, frequent throat clearing, difficulty swallowing, a chronic cough and a sore dry throat &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because fizzy drinks can cause the belly muscles to swell, which puts pressure on the sphincter muscles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They can also increase the acidity of the stomach, increasing the risk of reflux. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Consuming too much alcohol and coffee can also cause acid reflux. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Cleveland Clinic, at least half of patients who complain about chronic hoarseness have LPR, or 'silent' reflux. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Acid reflux is caused by acid flowing into the oesophagus—the tube that connects the mouth and the stomach—irritating soft tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This happens when the muscular valve at the top of the stomach, which usually closes to prevent food and stomach juices escaping, doesn't work properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While typical heartburn strikes at any time of day, usually after eating, silent reflux usually occurs at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;T&lt;span&gt;he condition can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms mimic other conditions, such as chest infections and allergies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other common symptoms include feeling that too much mucus is collecting in the throat and excessive burping. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors diagnose the silent condition by using a camera to look at a patient's throat and voice box, which will often be inflamed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment usually involves making lifestyle changes—including cutting back on alcohol and quitting smoking—taking antacids to reduce stomach acid and in some cases surgery to tighten the valve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antacids such as Gaviscon and Rennie work by forming a 'raft' over the stomach contents so that if anything escapes back into the throat, it is less

People with disordered eating behaviors might hide in plain sight behind popular diets and wellness trends like intermittent fasting, which provides the perfect cover for restrictive eating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s A Socially Acceptable Disguise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most people would be concerned to hear a friend say they were starving themselves, but no one bats an eye with intermittent fasting. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Intermittent fasting can sometimes serve as a socially acceptable disguise for disordered eating behaviors,” said registered dietitian nutritionist Becky Mehr, director of outpatient nutrition at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://renfrewcenter.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="The Renfrew Center" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68273bf7e4b0f10918e3174a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://renfrewcenter.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Renfrew Center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a network of eating disorder treatment facilities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“While it is often marketed as a tool for weight loss, improving metabolic health or simplifying eating patterns, it can become problematic — especially for those with a history of eating disorders,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mehr explained that because scheduled fasting requires skipping meals and ignoring hunger cues, it’ll hide your disordered eating without raising concern. In fact, it could promote the opposite: praise for weight loss or “perceived discipline” that could reinforce harmful behaviors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mehr adds, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Our bodies are not machines or calculators — they don’t thrive on rigid calorie restrictions or time-bound nourishment.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is It Worth the Risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingrecoverycenter.com/profile/anne-marie-omelia" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Anne Marie O’Melia," data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68273bf7e4b0f10918e3174a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.eatingrecoverycenter.com/profile/anne-marie-omelia" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Anne Marie O’Melia,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; c&lt;span&gt;hief clinical and quality officer at the Eating Recovery Center, told HuffPost, “For individuals who are genetically and environmentally vulnerable to developing eating disorders, any form of caloric restriction or adherence to rigid food rules — including intermittent fasting — significantly increases their risk.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In fact, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1471015322000873" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="recent research" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68273bf7e4b0f10918e3174a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1471015322000873" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;recent research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; has shown that many young women who participated in intermittent fasting had traits of eating disorder behaviors such as overeating, binge eating, vomiting, laxative use, compulsive exercise and fasting. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We know that dieting and restriction are the number one predictors of eating disorder onset, particularly in adolescents and young adults,” O’Melia explained. “The promise of short-term benefits like weight loss or metabolic changes pales in comparison to the real and devastating risks: Eating disorders have significant psychiatric and medical consequences, and the highest mortality rate among mental illnesses.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Intermittent fasting “may seem harmless or even beneficial at first, but for too many people, it is a gateway into long-term, life-threatening struggles with food and body,” she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bottom line: The potential benefits of intermittent fasting do not outweigh the risks of developing or worsening an eating disorder. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Jordan Lye via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jordan Lye via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Intermittent fasting is touted as a “lifestyle change” rather than a diet, where people consume calories on a 16:8 plan (fast for 16 hours; eat normally for eight hours), a 5:2 plan (eat normally for five days; fast for two days) or another variation.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look At Your Mindset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So how do you know if it’s safe to try intermittent fasting? Our experts shared that it’s all in your head — or, more specifically, in your mindset.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The key difference lies in mindset, intent and impact on daily life,” Mehr said. If you are able to do intermittent fasting without obsessive thoughts about food or body image, and without rigid food rules that impair your daily functioning, then it might be OK. For everyone else, it can quickly spiral into disordered eating. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This might look like “experiencing intense anxiety about breaking ‘rules,’ obsessing over food, feeling shame about eating, avoiding social events involving food or using fasting as a way to control weight at all costs,” according to O’Melia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“No one sets out thinking, ‘I want to develop an eating disorder,’ but for individuals with certain genetic, psychological and environmental risk factors, seemingly healthy choices can inadvertently lead to dangerous patterns,” O’Melia said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signs intermittent fasting is triggering disordered eating include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compensatory behaviors, like excessive exercise or purging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoiding social meals that don’t fall in your eating window.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increasing preoccupation with food, body image or weight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low energy, mood disturbances, sleep issues or trouble concentrating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only eating “safe” or “healthy” foods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating in isolation; secrecy or hiding of eating behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Binge eating symptoms, feeling of loss of control when eating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling anxiety, guilt or shame if you eat outside your “allowed” window.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experiencing medical issues such as fainting, amenorrhea, GI distress, or fatigue, dizziness, weakness, irritability or obsessional thinking about food.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Negative or emotionally reactive responses to expressions of concern about changes in behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any additional or increasing behaviors that can be associated with eating disorders, such as laxative use, changes in exercise patterns, developing food rules about the types of food eaten rather than just the times that food is eaten.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If fasting starts to feel like an obligation instead of a choice — or affects your ability to enjoy life — it may be time to reevaluate. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s critical to remember that the human body is incredibly complex — and it thrives when treated with compassion, not punishment,” O’Melia said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Shouldn’t Do Intermittent Fasting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Most people” should not do intermittent fasting, Mehr said, and “especially those with a history of eating disorders, mental health struggles or nutrient deficiencies.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;O’Melia added, “Anyone with a personal history or a significant family history of an eating disorder, disordered eating, body dysmorphia, significant anxiety or depression, trauma history, or compulsive exercise patterns should avoid intermittent fasting.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you have a fragile relationship with food and could be affected by self-imposed rules or restrictions around when you can eat, then intermittent fasting is not for you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Our bodies are designed to let us know when they need fuel,” Mehr explained. “Ignoring those cues can lead to preoccupation with food, disrupted metabolism and emotional distress. [Intermittent fasting] is like telling someone to only use the bathroom during certain hours — it creates fixation, not freedom.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our experts agreed that no one should do intermittent fasting without close guidance by their medical provider.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try This Instead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our experts were quick to slam any structured diet or food group restriction (other than for allergies).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Eating should be a source of nourishment and pleasure, not a battleground,” O’Melia explained. “I encourage patients to focus on balanced meals, variety, satisfaction and listening to their bodies.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both experts recommend intuitive eating that listens to hunger and fullness cues. This includes eating a wide variety of foods without guilt (yes, desserts too!); respecting body diversity; participating in joyful movement; managing your stress and getting enough sleep; and centering mental, emotional and social health alongside physical health.

Not quite, doctors say. Marshmallow root extract is best when a cough or sore throat is minor and not accompanied by other major symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the great benefits of the product is that kicks in and reduces irritation fairly quickly. Curry-Winchell pointed to the 2018 study, which found most participants felt the results in roughly 10 minutes&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;So, it may be a great option before you head into a class or meeting, hoping to keep coughing to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the effect doesn’t last super long. &lt;a href="https://medvidi.com/blog/author/dr-michael-chichak/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Michael Chichak" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68264c67e4b029d8a6109f59" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://medvidi.com/blog/author/dr-michael-chichak/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;Dr. Michael Chichak&lt;/a&gt;, the medical director at MEDvidi and a general practitioner with 13 years of experience, estimated around 10 to 20 minutes, though it can vary.

My husband and I have been happily married for 51 years. We paid for our wedding ourselves, coming from working-class families. My husband’s cousin was also engaged. The man she was engaged to came from a family that had money. They eloped the same day we got married and just came to our reception. We are at our reception sitting down at the head table when her mother, my husband’s aunt, comes up and asks us to hold up the meal until they arrive. I was really surprised but I was not going to let this ruin our day. I just politely said no because we had a schedule to keep. They arrived and made a big to-do. We didn’t let it ruin our day because we figured that our guests would just see them for what they were. We had a grand time – great food and lots of dancing and merrymaking and a wonderful time was had by all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LAI66H23ZNEBPM66TCERT6CPEI"&gt;– Double the Fun&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="M4IMMWWKJVDT5EJG3G35HF3AKQ"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dear Fun:&lt;/b&gt; Oh my!

Some fear that these signals, traveling at higher frequencies, could damage our cells. Scientists have now studied how 5G waves affect the activity of human skin cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results reveal no alarming signs of harm. Dr. Vivian Meyer from &lt;a href="https://constructor.university" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jacobs University Bremen&lt;/a&gt;, led the research to address these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5g-causes-no-harm-to-skin-cells"&gt;5G causes no harm to skin cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants exposed human skin cells to frequencies of 27 GHz and 40.5 GHz. These tests ran for 2 hours or 48 hours at power flux densities of 1 milliwatt per square centimeter and 10 milliwatts per square centimeter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team measured how these electromagnetic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/space-debris-may-create-a-future-with-no-internet-or-astronaut-missions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;fields&lt;/a&gt; might trigger changes in gene expression. They also tracked DNA methylation, which helps turn genes on or off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recommended safety limits for the general population sit at 1 milliwatt per square centimeter for this frequency range, based on the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection &lt;a href="https://www.icnirp.org/cms/upload/publications/ICNIRPrfgdl2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. This study used up to 10 times that level to see if any significant shifts might appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some earlier work pointed to possible health effects but failed to control for heat from the equipment. This group included temperature checks to rule out the chance that slight warming created misleading effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many news outlets have highlighted statements that 5G might cause everything from headaches to severe illness. This study tackled those claims by testing real human cells in controlled lab setups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-ionizing radiation, such as 5G, differs from high-energy sources like X-rays. These high-energy sources can break chemical bonds, but 5G waves do not have that ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-5g-affects-gene-expression"&gt;How 5G affects gene expression &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gene expression involves the way cells read genetic instructions and make proteins. If an outside factor changes that process, it can lead to subtle or major biological &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/quantum-teleportation-communication-achieved-on-regular-internet-cables/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;consequences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found no unusual patterns in the cells that received the 5G signals. They compared them with cells shielded from the waves and saw similar activity levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The quantum energies are far too low to have photochemical or even ionizing effects on cells,” stated Dr. Meyer. The authors also emphasized that routine tasks like making proteins or repairing tissue stayed normal. This calm response in gene expression points to no disruption from 5G.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millimeter-wave frequencies also have shallow skin penetration, often only a few millimeters into the body. That limited depth further reduces the odds of deep tissue interference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists watch gene expression in skin cells closely because 5G exposure can link to inflammation or other cell stress. No such signals were noticed in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5g-exposure-and-dna-methylation"&gt;5G exposure and DNA methylation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Methylation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Methylation&lt;/a&gt; is a chemical tag that can affect how genes function. Certain signals from the environment can change these tags, which sometimes alters cellular behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this project, no major shifts appeared in the cells’ methylation &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/taking-a-smartphone-break-can-improve-your-life-in-surprising-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;profiles&lt;/a&gt;. This suggests that the exposure did not create epigenetic stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0109435" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; found similar outcomes at frequencies in the millimeter-wave range, even when power levels were higher than everyday exposure. These stable methylation patterns match the stable gene expression findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous concerns stemmed from the fear that 5G might spark changes at the cellular level without immediate symptoms. These fresh data suggest otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have explored whether electromagnetic exposure could prompt long-term epigenetic shifts. Those might remain hidden until many cell cycles pass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these trials, the normal patterns suggest that any subtle changes are unlikely. This observation matches wider evidence that short-term exposure poses no known epigenetic threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-studies-could-reveal-5g-risks"&gt;Future studies could reveal 5G risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people wonder if long-term exposure might still pose unknown risks. Others question whether certain individuals might be more sensitive to electromagnetic signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study indicates no harmful alterations in skin cells from 5G exposure, but more work on various cell types could settle lingering doubts. Future projects may also review how repeated exposure interacts with other environmental factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists often stress the importance of consistent methods and proper temperature tracking. Such precautions help isolate real biological changes from simple heating effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors believe these findings calm persistent fears and show that 5G exposure to skin cells is unlikely to cause genetic or epigenetic damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-public-concerns-about-5g-health-risks"&gt;Public concerns about 5G health risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many researchers believe large-scale &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/climate-change-is-shrinking-earths-atmosphere-and-thats-bad-for-satellites/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;monitoring&lt;/a&gt; over years could confirm these laboratory insights. Ongoing surveillance might help ease public anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policymakers often rely on robust data for safety guidelines. They may update recommendations only if science uncovers new dangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern wireless networks have always raised questions about health. This well-controlled experiment looks like a solid step toward assurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many wonder if the matter is settled forever. Time will tell whether new research keeps indicating a lack of harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/4/5/pgaf127/8124427?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PNAS Nexus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 10:31:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxPQmlzM3RGMXFxa0owa2VxOWU5RE51eTVvSHZtWkpIMzUzRUxYcHBXWUUxY3ZuOVJndnkwc2NYWEZPRWg1aEk2OHZ5Q0FmQzRsOFdlV3FoWlJWNHY2Tnpxci1uRVRBc3V4SVhESXczQUw2cFF4dVZPMmw5bXlsanJfdjE5d2dPRVBRV0Z2ejcyWW9sZw</guid></item><item><title>美国已有3个月没有出现人类禽流感病例。专家们想知道为什么- CNN | The US hasn’t seen a human bird flu case in 3 months.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh05qw001v27p3bpjzdbia@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Health officials are making a renewed call for vigilance against bird flu, but some experts are puzzling over why reports of new human cases have stopped.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j00053b6mcl4t8okc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Has the search for cases been weakened by government cuts? Are immigrant farm workers, who have accounted for many of the U.S. cases, more afraid to come forward for testing amid the Trump administration’s deportation push? Is it just a natural ebb in infections?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j00063b6mxrs6onqb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We just don’t know why there haven’t been cases,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. “I think we should assume there are infections that are occurring in farmworkers that just aren’t being detected.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j00073b6mjgbiwf7i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The H5N1 bird flu &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-humans-animals-deaths-ae01d3717783f0cf41e23f3fedb97017" target="_blank"&gt;has been spreading widely&lt;/a&gt; among wild birds, poultry and other animals around the world for several years, and starting early last year became a problem in people and cows in the U.S.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j00083b6m3kqx8zyo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the last 14 months, infections have been reported in 70 people in the U.S. — most of them workers on dairy and poultry farms. One person died, but most of the infected people had mild illnesses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j00093b6mlbnmqq7f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The most recent infections confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were in early February in &lt;a href="https://www.centralnevadahd.org/press-release/" target="_blank"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://odh.ohio.gov/media-center/ODH-News-Releases/ohio-reports-first-human-case-of-bird-flu-021225" target="_blank"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://health.wyo.gov/wyomings-first-human-bird-flu-case-confirmed/" target="_blank"&gt;Wyoming&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000a3b6m3656avjg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            California had been a hotspot, with three-quarters of the nation’s infections in dairy cattle. But testing and cases among people have fallen off. At least 50 people were tested each month in late 2024, but just three people were tested in March, one in April and none in May so far, state records show. Overall, the state has confirmed H5N1 infections in 38 people, none after Jan. 14.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000b3b6m10o7stna@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During a call with U.S. doctors this month, one CDC official noted that there is a seasonality to bird flu: Cases peak in the fall and early winter, possibly due to the migration patterns of wild birds that are primary spreaders of the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000c3b6mvhtg5jps@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That could mean the U.S. is experiencing a natural — maybe temporary — decline in cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000d3b6mzx5bomz1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s unlikely that a severe human infection, requiring hospitalization, would go unnoticed, said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000e3b6muk4nhhzf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What’s more, a patchwork system that monitors viruses in sewage and wastewater has suggested &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/wwd-h5.html" target="_blank"&gt;limited activity&lt;/a&gt; recently.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000f3b6mldvrew71@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            New infections are still being detected in &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks" target="_blank"&gt;birds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock" target="_blank"&gt;cattle&lt;/a&gt;, but not as frequently as several months ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000g3b6mrjizlzc5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Given the fact that the number of animal detections has fallen according to USDA data, it’s not surprising that human cases have declined as well,” the CDC said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000h3b6mi0uzqs18@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Gregory Gray said he wasn’t concerned about the CDC not identifying new cases in months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000i3b6mu1tz3fy5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I don’t think that anybody’s hiding anything,” said Gray, an infectious disease speicialist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000j3b6m52qjrvro@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Osterholm and some other experts think it’s likely that at least some milder infections are going undetected. And they worry that the effort to find them has been eroding.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000k3b6mytznh2nm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Resignations at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Veterinary Medicine could slow the government’s bird flu monitoring, said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000l3b6moojfl10q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Three of 14 experts accepted deferred resignation offers at the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, which responds to disease outbreaks with crucial diagnostic information, he said. They are among more than 15,000 USDA staff to accept the offers, an agency spokesperson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000m3b6mcjmdrexp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And dozens of staff were fired at the FDA’s Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network, which investigates animal diseases caused by problems including contaminated pet food. Cats in several states have been sickened and died after eating raw pet food found to contain poultry infected with H5N1.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000n3b6mi39uhbrw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, said “targeted surveillance has really dropped off precipitously since Trump took office.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000o3b6mjgel3w2y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She wonders if immigrant farmworkers are too scared to come forward.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000p3b6m5321zubp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I can’t argue with anyone who would be risking getting shipped to a Salvadoran gulag for reporting an exposure or seeking testing,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmawd6z5d000a3b6m5o6c379q@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="cdc-says-the-risk-to-the-general-public-remains-low" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        CDC says the risk to the general public remains low
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000q3b6mqeycqzh5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC characterizes the risk to the general public as low, although it is higher for people who work with cattle and poultry or who are in contact with wild birds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000r3b6mvnq30cii@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pandemic-flu/php/monitoring/irat-virus-summaries.html" target="_blank"&gt;an agency assessment&lt;/a&gt; said there is a “moderate risk” that currently circulating strains of bird flu could cause a future pandemic, but the CDC stressed that other emerging forms of bird flu has been similarly labeled in the past.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000s3b6mgukqxmpp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, research is continuing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000t3b6mmju6dg17@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Texas A&amp;amp;M University scientists have collected blood samples from dairy workers in multiple states to test for signs of past H5N1 exposure, said David Douphrate, a workplace health and safety expert leading the project. The yearlong study is funded by a nearly $4 million grant from the CDC and is expected to conclude in July.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000u3b6mfojnnfwv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Douphrate said he leveraged two decades of relationships with dairy producers and workers to gain access to the farms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000v3b6m9sk7qag8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have had very good participation,” Douphrate said. “They have been very willing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000w3b6myc0pmgzn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Similar surveillance is “urgently needed” among domestic cats, said Kristen Coleman, a researcher at the University of Maryland at College Park who studies emerging animal diseases. She recently released a paper reviewing bird flu in infections in cats between 2004 and 2024.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000x3b6msekfbi4h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Barn cats that died after drinking raw milk were one of &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-dairy-farmers-barb-petersen-07bd5accb01441bc5d279464271d2371" target="_blank"&gt;the first signs&lt;/a&gt; that dairy cows were becoming infected with bird flu in 2024. Since then, the Agriculture Department has confirmed more than 120 domestic cats infected with the virus across the U.S.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Infections have mostly been found in cats that died. Less is known about milder infections, whether cats can recover from bird flu — or whether the virus can spill over into people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Coleman has been collecting blood samples from cats across the U.S. to see if they have evidence of previous exposure to the virus. But the process is slow and research funding is uncertain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

And soda, breakfast cereals and ice cream the new opioids?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his new book, “Diet, Drugs, and Dopamine: The New Science of Achieving a Healthy Weight” (&lt;a class="link" href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250381279/dietdrugsanddopamine/" target="_blank"&gt;Flatiron Books&lt;/a&gt;), former FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler argues that ultraprocessed foods — meaning “irresistible, highly processed, highly palatable, energy-dense, high-glycemic foods,” as he describes them — have been purposefully engineered by Big Food to be addictive. He calls them “ultraformulated” instead of “ultraprocessed” so as to highlight the deliberate intent on the part of food manufacturers. As a result, 41.9% of adults in the U.S. struggle with obesity, he says. And by 2030, he projects about half of us will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a “health catastrophe,” Kessler says, “that has reached its apex on every level.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-right&gt; &lt;div class="infobox" data-click="infoBox" data-module-id="0000018f-3b10-de58-afaf-bbdb2f310002"&gt;       &lt;p class="infobox-description"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shelf Help is a wellness column where we interview researchers, thinkers and writers about their latest books — all with the aim of learning how to live a more complete life.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toxic or visceral fat — meaning fat around our internal organs — has led to a rise in diseases and conditions such as Type 2 diabetes, arthritis, blood clots, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, dementia, stroke and certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 weight loss drugs, such as Wegovy and Zepbound, have helped millions of people shed weight and curb food cravings. But they create additional health problems, Kessler says, and there’s not enough scientific data accrued yet to speak to their efficacy or safety, long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a topic Kessler is intimately familiar with. He’s battled food addiction since childhood, growing up in New York, and his addiction ballooned in college and medical school when sub sandwiches and chicken wings were his rewards for studying hard. He’s since struggled with managing the side effects of GLP-1 drugs. To reverse the obesity crisis, says Kessler, we need to better understand addiction itself: how ultraprocessed foods take hold of our rational brain. We must also create a new paradigm for addiction, Kessler says, as the current one views addicts through the lens of weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his book, Kessler urges us to recognize that obesity is a chronic condition that needs to be treated as such. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Times spoke with Kessler about healthy weight loss strategies for the long-term, guidelines for using GLP-1s safely, the body positivity movement and improving lifespan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0e8649f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/320x213!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5c%2Ffb%2Fd968829846a3aaa245bf09920480%2Fdavid-a-kessler-by-joy-asico-smith.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/58d73d8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/568x379!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5c%2Ffb%2Fd968829846a3aaa245bf09920480%2Fdavid-a-kessler-by-joy-asico-smith.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8d152bb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/768x512!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5c%2Ffb%2Fd968829846a3aaa245bf09920480%2Fdavid-a-kessler-by-joy-asico-smith.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f2d4064/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1080x720!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5c%2Ffb%2Fd968829846a3aaa245bf09920480%2Fdavid-a-kessler-by-joy-asico-smith.jpg 1080w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2c9971c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1240x826!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5c%2Ffb%2Fd968829846a3aaa245bf09920480%2Fdavid-a-kessler-by-joy-asico-smith.jpg 1240w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/56f09a0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1440x960!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5c%2Ffb%2Fd968829846a3aaa245bf09920480%2Fdavid-a-kessler-by-joy-asico-smith.jpg 1440w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6ccafc7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/2160x1440!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5c%2Ffb%2Fd968829846a3aaa245bf09920480%2Fdavid-a-kessler-by-joy-asico-smith.jpg 2160w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="Dr. David A.

What is it? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve failed to recognize how difficult it is to escape the pull of food addiction and overcome our brain’s built-in reward response to these ultraformulated foods that flood our food supply. I’m not talking about cocaine or amphetamines that excessively hijack the dopamine circuits. But the addictive circuits are part of all of us. We are all wired to focus on the most salient stimuli in our environment. And for many of us, that stimuli are these ultraformulated foods. Food is very, very powerful in changing how we feel. It’s not a question of willpower. Our bodies have experienced an insidious decline over the past half a century. And that’s been caused by this never-ending consumption of foods that can trigger the addictive circuits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How can we “quiet the noise,” as you say, around food addiction?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the interaction between the stimuli in our environment and our brains. Change our environment, and we can remarkably change what’s going on in our brains. [Environment] is everything outside our bodies that we interact with, from the moment we wake up to the moment we go to sleep. What you put on your TV, what fast food restaurants you pass by on the way to work, we are constantly being cued. So you try to eliminate the cues. Or change your environment. Many of us don’t have the opportunity to leave our environment. And the food industry isn’t prone to change their behavior any time soon. But we now have pharmaceutical aids to help tamp that down. The effect of these &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2024-11-05/microdosing-ozempic-weight-loss-drugs-diy-dosage"&gt;GLP-1 [weight loss] drugs&lt;/a&gt; on food noise, that’s the big discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;GLP-1 drugs can lead to serious medical conditions that concern you. What are they&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;  and what should doctors and drug companies be doing differently?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact is that the only way you’re going to lose weight — whether it’s drugs or diet or surgery — is to have an energy deficit. [GLP-1s] are very effective at getting you to consume less. But some people are eating less than 1,000 calories a day. There are people eating 600, 800 calories. You have to be under medical care or you run the risk of malnutrition. Food stays in your gut longer and that delay in gastric entering [called gastroparesis] can cause its own set of symptoms as well as metabolic consequences such as hypoglycemia, low blood sugar and other metabolic states. They all result from malnutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many doctors who are prescribing this are not well-trained in obesity medicine or in nutrition. And it’s very important, if possible, that a team of healthcare professionals, including a dietitian, be available. There’s no doubt that [drug companies] need to do a better job of studying the real world data. How to use these drugs, how to safely get off these drugs, is a key issue. There needs to be better labeling surrounding gastroparesis and the risks associated with these drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-left&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/65bc51e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1875x2850+0+0/resize/320x486!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb9%2Fbd%2F76f7969e4043a529237395cabbeb%2Fbook-cover.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b81a681/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1875x2850+0+0/resize/568x863!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb9%2Fbd%2F76f7969e4043a529237395cabbeb%2Fbook-cover.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ff82cec/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1875x2850+0+0/resize/768x1167!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb9%2Fbd%2F76f7969e4043a529237395cabbeb%2Fbook-cover.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3c140f1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1875x2850+0+0/resize/1080x1642!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb9%2Fbd%2F76f7969e4043a529237395cabbeb%2Fbook-cover.jpg 1080w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/27b9c7c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1875x2850+0+0/resize/1240x1885!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb9%2Fbd%2F76f7969e4043a529237395cabbeb%2Fbook-cover.jpg 1240w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/00bd974/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1875x2850+0+0/resize/1440x2189!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb9%2Fbd%2F76f7969e4043a529237395cabbeb%2Fbook-cover.jpg 1440w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/26f92c8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1875x2850+0+0/resize/2160x3283!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb9%2Fbd%2F76f7969e4043a529237395cabbeb%2Fbook-cover.jpg 2160w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="Flatiron Books" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e5c1d74/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1875x2850+0+0/resize/320x486!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb9%2Fbd%2F76f7969e4043a529237395cabbeb%2Fbook-cover.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/edea149/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1875x2850+0+0/resize/568x863!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb9%2Fbd%2F76f7969e4043a529237395cabbeb%2Fbook-cover.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/144b394/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1875x2850+0+0/resize/768x1167!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb9%2Fbd%2F76f7969e4043a529237395cabbeb%2Fbook-cover.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5146bf3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1875x2850+0+0/resize/1080x1642!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb9%2Fbd%2F76f7969e4043a529237395cabbeb%2Fbook-cover.jpg 1080w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/382f930/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1875x2850+0+0/resize/1240x1885!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb9%2Fbd%2F76f7969e4043a529237395cabbeb%2Fbook-cover.jpg 1240w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2bdc213/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1875x2850+0+0/resize/1440x2189!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb9%2Fbd%2F76f7969e4043a529237395cabbeb%2Fbook-cover.jpg 1440w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/38d332c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1875x2850+0+0/resize/2160x3283!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb9%2Fbd%2F76f7969e4043a529237395cabbeb%2Fbook-cover.jpg 2160w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1cdee42/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1875x2850+0+0/resize/2000x3040!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb9%2Fbd%2F76f7969e4043a529237395cabbeb%2Fbook-cover.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;    &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Flatiron Books / Joy Asico Smith)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Most people aren’t going to be on GLP-1s for life because they’re expensive and have adverse effects, you say. Yet going off the drugs, most people gain back the weight. So what’s the solution, long-term? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question is about &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2024-11-05/microdosing-ozempic-weight-loss-drugs-diy-dosage"&gt;intermittent use&lt;/a&gt; — can I use these drugs to get my weight off? Then can I use them, intermittently, over a lifetime? But we don’t have data yet to know [if] that’s safe. But you can use these drugs to condition yourself to learn how to eat differently. I eat very differently now — I don’t want to put large amounts of food in my stomach. I’ve conditioned myself not to do that. How long that will last, we’ll see. So you need a &lt;i&gt;range&lt;/i&gt; of tools. That can range from nutrition therapy to behavioral therapy to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2025-03-13/ozempic-workout-glp-1-exercise-los-angeles-personal-trainer-gym"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; — and they’re going to vary for the individual. There’s no one tool that’s gonna work for the duration. The pharmacological tools are only one tool, it’s the entire tool box that has to be available. But the most important thing is to recognize that this is a chronic condition that needs continuous care, even after you’ve lost the weight.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Achieving a healthy body weight starts with understanding addiction, you say, not necessarily the old advice &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;to &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;“eat less and move more.” Why is this so important? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ultimate answer &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; ‘eat less and move more.’ But we can’t do that because of the physiological and addictive circuits — they stand in the way. We have to understand that addiction is not just about the weak and the downtrodden. It’s part of all of us, those circuits. We can’t overestimate the amount of stigma and shame and distress that many feel because they’ve been unable to control their weight. They feel it’s their fault, they don’t like themselves for it and society has created all these biases attached to it. The simple recognition [that] our brains are not fully under our control when it comes to these energy dense foods is a very important step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;There’s a delicate balance between the body positivity movement, which encourages people to accept their bodies as they are, and the health crisis that is obesity, which you say is a root cause of many diseases. How do you suggest we navigate that? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That movement did a lot of good — it took the shame out of it, it took the stigma out. But it was at a time when we didn’t have effective tools to reduce visceral fat. You can love your body, but also do things for your health. Those things are not diametrically opposite. And I’m not comfortable with the amount of morbidity and mortality associated with visceral fat and saying we shouldn’t do something about that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;

And I was part of it beginning January 2021. The reason we were able to do what we did, and get those vaccines safely developed and produced and distributed, was because there existed institutions within our federal government: the [National Institutes of Health], the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration], the [Center for the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority], the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]. Those institutions had enormous expertise and resources. And yes, we had to put it together; yes, we had to do things differently. But we were able to build on that infrastructure. Now they’re destroying that infrastructure. I don’t get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To end on a positive note: What amount of weight loss actually &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;decreases &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;future risk of disease?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s remarkable is that relatively small amounts can have significant effects. If you want to reverse certain conditions, that would require more weight loss. But almost any weight loss is going to add clinical benefits and be useful in reducing cardiometabolic risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxOQk5DelRWMFZWZG41eGZnVVppcE9JYzhKdi1wNlZ1ODU1ZW1yLUI2Q0wtU3ZUbEFTUEhTVnVCMENJY1daMnVGRkduQnBmeUFyWXJ4LVlRZU1WU2p0ZVBoX0pWRU55dXZCdDBHOTZPeVA1SUw5RE1sZFBDZ1M1TS1sV1Y0Y19JbmEtN1NSY3ROcmR5cjBkN0FoRTNJdkFHZlE</guid></item><item><title>是否有不良酒精含量最低的酒类？ -《纽约时报》 | Is There a Least Bad Alcohol? - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxQczZxV3Qya1N5Y29oLXgyQnZuMGxMa3VVLTNsRXBGNzQya2pOcC1WRVp1X1l0WHR0dVRITnE5ZFFFbUJKdVoyWlA5OElIUzdTcjVUcHZHM0ZSUW9UamtIV3FyRElYNUZFZ1BlR2JySW1TUndDWkRvVno5SlFacDZ5aDlhM2YtRHdZNU5uUXJEU19PUWFHQ1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"&gt;Q: I’ve been trying to cut back on alcohol lately, but I do drink occasionally. Are any types of alcohol less risky than others?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;If you’ve heard that &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/17/well/eat/red-wine-heart-health.html" title=""&gt;red wine is better for you&lt;/a&gt; than beer or liquor, or that clear liquor like vodka or gin is less harmful than dark liquor like rum or whiskey, we have bad news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Alcohol is alcohol,” said Jürgen Rehm, a senior scientist at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto. Drinking any type of alcohol, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/13/well/mind/alcohol-health-effects.html" title=""&gt;in any amount&lt;/a&gt;, is bad for health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Still, experts say, it’s sometimes not reasonable or even practical for people to avoid alcohol entirely. So if you’re going to drink, there are some strategies you can take to reduce your risk, and to avoid some of the other unpleasant effects of drinking, like hangovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-d522b46"&gt;Why Alcohol Is So Harmful&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;When you have a drink, your body turns the ethanol that’s present in the alcoholic beverage into a “really nasty substance” called acetaldehyde, which can damage your DNA, said Timothy Stockwell, an alcohol researcher at the University of Victoria in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Many tissues in the body, including those in the mouth, throat, liver, colon and breasts, are susceptible to this harm. And when that DNA gets repaired, cancerous mutations may arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

But we do know they have been found from the &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.geochemicalperspectivesletters.org/article1829/#Fig3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;depths of the Mariana Trench&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plastics-remote-places-microplastics-earth-mount-everest" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;heights of Mount Everest&lt;/a&gt;. And we know that plastic is accumulating in our bodies, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“The air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat — it’s in it,” said Richard Thompson, a marine biologist at the University of Plymouth who &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1094559" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;coined the term “microplastics”&lt;/a&gt; in a 2004 paper. “We’re exposed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-5e044a2"&gt;What are microplastics?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Scientists generally define “microplastics” as pieces less than 5 millimeters long. Nanoplastics, which measure less than 1 micrometer, are the smallest of these and the most likely to get into our blood and tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Microplastics mostly come from larger plastics, which degrade with use or when they aren’t disposed of properly, said Jeffrey Farner, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at the Florida A&amp;amp;M University-Florida State University College of Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“We use plastics in areas or in ways that lend themselves to the production of microplastics or to the breakdown over time,” Dr. Farner said — for example, in construction materials that are weathered outdoors, in tubing that generates microplastics when it is cut and in agriculture, as plastic mulch or in irrigation systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Within a couple of weeks, she was debilitated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Her vomiting exacerbated the excruciating pain in her skull. She spent nearly every hour in bed with the covers pulled over her head, blocking out any sliver of light. Even the clock on her microwave was too much. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I went from training for a marathon, raising two teenagers and having a job to essentially being bedridden,” said Carrigan, 41, of Bakersfield, California, who works for Kern County Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Her condition continued to get worse and doctors couldn’t provide answers — until her third visit to the hospital, when one doctor asked her if she’d had any respiratory symptoms before the headaches started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She had. About a month before the headaches started, Carrigan had what she thought was a typical cold — though she recalled that her cough lingered a bit longer than normal and she went on to develop a rash on her thighs. Both symptoms got better without treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/250519-Brynn-Carrigan-Zion-Angels-Landing-Hike-ew-408p-2ccf8a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250519-Brynn-Carrigan-Zion-Angels-Landing-Hike-ew-408p-2ccf8a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/250519-Brynn-Carrigan-Zion-Angels-Landing-Hike-ew-408p-2ccf8a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250519-Brynn-Carrigan-Zion-Angels-Landing-Hike-ew-408p-2ccf8a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250519-Brynn-Carrigan-Zion-Angels-Landing-Hike-ew-408p-2ccf8a.jpg" alt="Brynn Carrigan on the Zion Angels Landing Hike in Zion National Park."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Brynn Carrigan hiking Angels Landing in Zion National Park.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Brynn Carrigan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;These turned out to be key pieces of information. A biopsy of her spinal fluid revealed that Carrigan had coccidioidal meningitis, a rare complication of a fungal infection called Valley fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I knew something was wrong but never in a million years did I think it would be something so serious,” Carrigan said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Valley fever, or coccidioidomycosis, is caused by inhaling &lt;em&gt;coccidioides&lt;/em&gt; spores, a type of fungi endemic to the hot, dry climate of the southwestern United States. Climate change is creating drier soils that are inching farther east, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/valley-fever-historically-found-only-southwest-spreading-can-devastati-rcna64313" target="_blank"&gt;expanding the range&lt;/a&gt; of the fungi. Valley fever is increasingly being diagnosed outside its usual territory and cases have been rising across the Western U.S. While Arizona still sees the highest number each year, California is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/valley-fever/php/statistics/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;closing the gap&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;From 2000 through 2016, California had 1,500 to 5,500 cases a year. From 2017 through 2023, those numbers &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverDashboard.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;jumped&lt;/a&gt; to 7,700 to 9,000 annual cases. Preliminary &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverProvisionalDashboard.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; for 2024 puts the count at more than 12,600 — the highest the state has ever seen and about 3,000 more cases than the previous record, in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Early data shows California is on track for another record-breaking year. Already, the state has &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverProvisionalDashboard.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;logged&lt;/a&gt; more than 3,000 confirmed cases of Valley fever statewide, more than there were at the same time last year and nearly double what cases were at this time in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There is no question that the number of cases of coccidioidomycosis is enormously higher than before,” said Dr. Royce Johnson, chief of the division of infectious disease and director of the Valley Fever Institute at Kern Medical in California. “If you want to see me, right now you’d have to wait until July, and that goes for my colleagues, too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drought cycles driving spread&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Carrigan lives in Kern County, a dry, sprawling region that sits between two mountain ranges at the southern end of California’s Central Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The county has already recorded &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverProvisionalDashboard.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;at least 900 Valley fever cases&lt;/a&gt; so far this year and has been ground zero for the fungal infection in the state for the last three years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But the consistently high cases in places like Kern County are not driving the upward trend in California, said Gail Sondermeyer Cooksey, an epidemiologist at the California Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Instead, new hot spots are emerging along the edges of the Central Valley — in Monterey and San Luis Obispo counties, along California’s central coast. Cases in Contra Costa County, just east of Berkeley, have &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverProvisionalDashboard.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;tripled&lt;/a&gt; so far this year compared with the same time in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It appears to be spreading out,” Sondermeyer Cooksey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Many factors likely influence how well &lt;em&gt;coccidioides &lt;/em&gt;spores multiply and spread, “but one thing we have identified as a big driver of those peaks and dips is drought,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(22)00202-9/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; in The Lancet Planetary Health found that drought years suppress Valley fever cases, but multiple years of drought followed by a wet winter causes cases to rebound sharply. This shift in weather patterns, which is driven by climate change, appears to largely influence where new Valley fever hot spots emerge. Longer, drier summers can also &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2024.0821" target="_blank"&gt;shift transmission season&lt;/a&gt;, when the spores spread, from late summer and early winter to earlier in the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We’re seeing wetter wets and drier dries across the Southwest, but California is seeing that to a higher degree,” said Jennifer Head, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan, who studies Valley fever and climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In Arizona, new hot spots are popping up in places in the state that have a climate more similar to California’s than elsewhere in Arizona. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The highest increases in Arizona are in the northern plateau regions, which, similar to California, have historically been colder and wetter,” Head said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closely tracking Los Angeles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The climate patterns expanding Valley fever’s range in California are the same ones that &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/climate-change/california-fires-weather-climate-change-rcna190892" target="_blank"&gt;drive increasingly intense wildfires&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists are still trying to understand how fires may worsen Valley fever risk, but some research has shown &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196%2823%2900046-3/fulltext#:~:text=A%20population%2Dbased%20study%20in%20California%20found%20that,the%20preceding%201%20month%20and%203%20months." target="_blank"&gt;a link&lt;/a&gt; between wildfire smoke and higher rates of diagnoses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Sondermeyer Cooksey said the state health department warned first responders to January’s devastating fires in Los Angeles County of the potentially increased risk of Valley fever in the area because of the fires. There have been past &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7134a4.htm" target="_blank"&gt;outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; among wildland firefighters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There’s some limited evidence that wildfires may spread the &lt;em&gt;coccidioides&lt;/em&gt; spores. In a 2023 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10402968/#:~:text=We%20find%20limited%20evidence%20that,pre%2D%20and%20post%2Dwildfires" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers looked at 19 fires across California and observed higher rates of Valley fever following three of those fires. These fires tended to be larger, located near population centers and burned areas that had high Valley fever transmission prior to the fire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s not entirely clear whether there is a link between wildfires and Valley fever, but what is important to know is that &lt;em&gt;coccidioides&lt;/em&gt; live in the dirt and anything that disturbs the dirt can exacerbate Valley fever,” Sondermeyer Cooksey said. “Fires do that, then we have all of the reconstruction projects that also disturb soil.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Peak Valley fever season hasn’t happened yet this year. Because reconstruction efforts are disturbing soil in the burn scar, Sondermeyer Cooksey said state and local public health departments “are closely tracking the numbers” in areas hit by January’s fires. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cases after Lightning in a Bottle festival &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Diagnosing Valley fever is tricky, mostly because its symptoms overlap with other respiratory illnesses including flu, Covid and pneumonia. If someone experiences those symptoms, it’s important for them to let their doctor know if they’ve been around disturbed soil or dust — in a construction zone, camping, hiking, working outside or at a festival — or in an area known to have Valley fever, Sondermeyer Cooksey said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Symptoms typically show up one to three weeks after exposure, but it can take as long as eight weeks, so people may not make an immediate connection, Head, of the University of Michigan, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Last year, at least &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR24-22.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;19 people&lt;/a&gt; who attended the Lightning in a Bottle music festival — which is being held in Kern County again this month — were diagnosed with Valley fever later in the summer. At least eight were hospitalized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Lightning in a Bottle is right in the middle of the endemic region, that’s one of the hot spots for the disease,” said Dr. George Thompson, director of the &lt;a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/valley-fever/" target="_blank"&gt;Center for Valley Fever&lt;/a&gt; at the University of California, Davis, adding that the vast majority of people who attend will not get an infection, but people who aren’t from an endemic area may be at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Thompson said it’s clear that he and his colleagues across the state are treating more patients for the infection. Only about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/yellow-book/hcp/post-travel-evaluation/post-travel-respiratory-infections.html" target="_blank"&gt;1% of cases&lt;/a&gt; result in life-threatening meningitis or other complications, as Carrigan’s did, but once a person is infected, they never clear the fungus from their body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There is no drug that kills cocci, so what keeps you from being ill is your immune response,” Johnson, of Kern Medical, said. To treat the infection, people are given antifungals “long enough for a person’s immune system to figure out how to control it. If you then do something to disrupt that immunity, it can start growing again, and that can surface years later,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Carrigan spent the last year on an intense regimen of anti-fungal treatments. During the first few months, she lost most of her hair and eyelashes and barely recognized herself in the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She’s now made a full recovery and even ran a marathon this spring, but she still takes anti-fungal medication. Carrigan said she wants more people to understand both the &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/pages/Coccidioidomycosis.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;warning signs of Valley fever&lt;/a&gt; and the importance of telling their doctor if they’ve been somewhere with cases, which could help people get a faster diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Even if it’s only 1% of cases, as we see cases increase, the number of people who experience complications is going to rise, too,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxQVDVIZ1VxSmNrVjZDVEtYcEp1RVJvUUxqR08zcVhZZEVOaHk2OHBuQWJPY0NMX3M0M1FlZEFPNTNEWjVNUzY2ZXMteGxYdDZVVm5tSk84dGt1SE1xYVRzM215ZEFPemMwOUIyTnF4ODFFbDRLSm1MU2wtTEp5dEJNNjJfMDZpa3FtMTdVOGZzWElJeUgxb1NHZVNtZi01dHM2Wm1kM3FWQ1N5U2owRWlYbUZHLVQ2QdIBVkFVX3lxTE03YTFUamZ2VDYtR2RmX0dZV2drZEhxRV9VR0FSZTlVaUdpOGQ0NjJSVDB5TjFtbWdQNnh5czBsUFBTU01Ibk1UVVNUaUk3MXM0M2d5anBn</guid></item><item><title>麻省理工学院、哈佛大学科学家在阿尔茨海默病研究方面取得重要突破- MassLive | MIT, Harvard scientists make important breakthrough in Alzheimer’s research - MassLive</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxQdDR2OWluaGNNTFpqVHBBTnVMMjNlQUVTNnZnZTd5bG9FYjZpRmZWQVZNVU5ULUF5TlBqYllrOFFsVzM5akwtUlRYZGpGdjFFOENuUUpOSElQUEhndms4SU5WNGVnQlA5akhrMWhHWEFELWdNSFN2eE44WGtBa05kci1fUXN1MVdfcFVBVjkyNU1OdUVRUS1BQkxPcHhadHFLc0lUY1pzQmlSbXY2N012NWU2X1Z6SFXSAcsBQVVfeXFMUGJfS2NJSmZpOEZQRk5qS2dKUTRhU3Q4UWlpa3ExUDJLeXk4MjlCNm1lS1RBNWpfeksxRndsaTFpMTFSdzI4LTVEM19HS3o4ci0zYncwMUN3NmplaENBT0FYX1psOXBrSF9TTVlLWlEtcV93MnI3OEphS3dtTTVjTE9BNzVneFpnVk8yd1YyR0NGU013WE5kRU9EREV3cDNVMktxZXJGRW5NYVJENXlWRGxmQXVYdVlabUdNX2dyZWg1cUF4Y3BIbUgxQTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YWQCCNU6MZAKFPQJDJCMZ5YN5A"&gt;Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard Medical School have identified new targets for treating and preventing Alzheimer’s disease, according to MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JLMLHRVVEZGLPKDETLGW27SYGE"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative brain disease that affects people’s memory and other mental functions.

                &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, during a negotiation with my 10-year-old about how many stuffed animals are too many, he told me that a messy room was a “sign of creativity.” I was skeptical, but he explained that he had learned this from a YouTuber and—this was crucial—the YouTuber had &lt;em&gt;shown a research study.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I attempted to explain that all research studies are not created equal, and some studies are better than others, but it fell on deaf ears. &lt;em&gt;Mom, it’s science. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This interaction is not far from many of the interactions I have every day with people online, many of whom are trying to determine the accuracy of claims about child-rearing and parenting, often related to medical topics. And, very often, these claims they are seeing are, ostensibly, based on research studies. On TikTok, on YouTube, on Instagram—doctors or other seemingly credentialed individuals are posting carousels with &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJCtnF6zM3D/?img_index=9"&gt;screenshots of scientific studies&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJl7kNYuZv0/"&gt;green-screening videos of themselves&lt;/a&gt; in front of research papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;        


&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these people are true experts in their fields, and some of these scientific papers are excellent, and some of the findings in the papers are accurate. But some of these online voices—even some people with medical degrees or other credentials—aren’t reading the literature correctly, and the papers they are showing are based on poor methods or biased data and do not support the claims that are being made. But for consumers of this content, it can be extremely difficult, basically impossible, to separate truth from fiction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core problem: We have what economists call a “&lt;a href="https://quickonomics.com/terms/pooling-equilibrium/#:~:text=Definition%20of%20Pooling%20Equilibrium,them%20based%20on%20their%20behavior."&gt;pooling equilibrium&lt;/a&gt;,” a concept derived from the study of labor markets. Imagine that workers come in two types: hard-working and lazy. The employer wants to hire only hard-working people, but there is no way to tell who’s hard-working and who is not from just looking at them. Now, imagine there is a credential job-seekers can get—say, a college degree. This takes work, which means this credential is easier for the hard-working group to get than the lazy group. If the degree is hard enough to get, we end up with a &lt;a href="https://quickonomics.com/terms/separating-equilibrium/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;separating equilibrium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The hard-working people get the degree, the lazy ones do not, and the employer can use that degree to tell whom they want to hire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This breaks down if the credential becomes easier to get. If college magically becomes easy (say, because of widespread grade inflation), then both the hard-working job-seekers and the lazy ones will get the credential, and now the employer is back to being unable to tell who is who using that marker. Then, we have a &lt;em&gt;pooling equilibrium.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health communication—especially across social media—has become that pooling equilibrium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It used to be the case that when the results of scientific studies were disseminated, the messaging came from your doctor or national organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These organizations are by no means perfect, but this messaging was developed by people trained in interpreting medical data and putting it in a broader context. Their messaging was often based on thorough reviews of many studies and expert consensus. Part of what dictated this structure was the fact that &lt;em&gt;access&lt;/em&gt; to these studies was limited and excluded the general public, creating a barrier that generated this separating equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, access to scientific research has become more democratized. &lt;a href="https://laneguides.stanford.edu/openaccess"&gt;Open access&lt;/a&gt; to scientific journals has become more widespread, and there has been a greater push to try to help the general public get access to and understand research findings. This has a lot of benefits, but it has made it far easier for non-experts to appear like experts when they want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

                    “The essence of snake oil is that the person selling it promises a full solution with very little work. Cut out sugar, and your child will be cured. Buy my supplement and your health will improve. All you need for your inflammation is my $85.99 parasite cleanse.”            &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two other factors have made this even more of an issue. The first is that the algorithm of social media, which values views and engagement, has incentivized people who &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; true experts to produce social content that looks very similar to those who are not. The second is that we are increasingly seeing disagreement within official sources that normally agree. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, has suggested autism is caused by vaccines, while the AAP and the CDC say it is not. This type of internal official disagreement causes confusion and engenders distrust of institutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is this necessarily a problem? Many people would say that allowing broad access to information is all to the good, and people can see the information and make decisions for themselves. The problem is that, in many cases, the non-expert messaging is not providing a complete picture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example. Recently, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/drmarkhyman/p/DHDn3OYy0zV/"&gt;a large Instagram account&lt;/a&gt;—run by a doctor—posted a study on ADHD and diet, with the claim that 78 percent of children experienced significant improvement in their ADHD by dietary changes. The implication, in the caption, was that by cutting out a few offending food ingredients (gluten! food dyes!) ADHD might be cured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that this post was woefully incomplete. There &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a study (from 15 years ago) about diet and ADHD, but the intervention was not the removal of food dyes but instead a complete elimination diet in which children were allowed to eat only a small number of foods (venison or lamb, rice, some vegetables, and pears). Some children’s ADHD symptoms did improve in the short term on this diet, but such a restricted diet is nearly impossible for families to maintain. &lt;a href="https://parentdata.org/adhd-triggered-by-diet/"&gt;Other studies that focus more directly on items like sugar and food dyes&lt;/a&gt; have not shown the same impacts. An expert-driven analysis of the possible links between ADHD and diet would make all of these points, which would provide enough context for families to talk to their doctor about whether dietary changes are a reasonable option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, parents hear that their child’s ADHD might be fixed if they just eliminate popsicles and Froot Loops, which is both false and may cause people to delay going to the doctor to get treatment that might be effective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we accept that cherry-picking research in this way is a problem, the natural question is: How do we return to a separating equilibrium? For individuals, this boils down to asking whether there are any signals you can reliably use to figure out who is providing good information and who is, basically, a quack. Relying on someone using scientific studies doesn’t necessarily work, and seemingly legitimate credentials like having “Dr.” in a title are not always reliable indicators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no perfect answer to this, which is part of why I spend my days debunking online misinformation about topics like &lt;a href="https://parentdata.org/prenatal-vitamins-expensive-worth-it/"&gt;expensive prenatal vitamins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://parentdata.org/should-you-throw-out-your-black-plastic-kitchen-tools/"&gt;plastic utensils&lt;/a&gt;. But there is a key differentiator to watch for: whether the messaging suggests an easy fix. Much of this online content focuses on hard problems in parenting or health—the rise of autism or ADHD, how to improve your blood pressure or heart health, how to lose weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of these difficult issues has an easy fix or a simple answer. But the essence of snake oil is that the person selling it promises a full solution with very little work. Cut out sugar, and your child will be cured. Buy my supplement and your health will improve. All you need for your inflammation is my $85.99 parasite cleanse. We will know the cause of autism &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0z9nmzvdlo"&gt;by September&lt;/a&gt;. The “one simple trick” is inherent in the sales pitch, so these messengers cannot give this up, even though it makes it clear they are not true experts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, the way to separate at least some of this misinformation from authoritative knowledge may be very simple: If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Dispatch</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 06:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPdWJIWnlfdzV1a0lZNkZTbDdoVlBGTlJXVnVfZ1ZQVVBzSTRtWmt5SXptZjR0TEhTS2hxX3owV1lfcXVJTm5LUUdrUmtGOWhyaDZGMEpVX2cwREZZV3Q1NzZXT0p5SmJLWjFIZjRydy1weEp6RExVTldxRngzclhOUE9iWGpDdkxH</guid></item><item><title>告别节食！这种简单的分子可以帮助您长寿！ -玻璃年鉴 | Say Goodbye to Dieting!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the United States, research focused on aging may hold the key to extending our lifespan. Scientists suggest that a specific nutritional adjustment could have positive effects on longevity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-actirise-slot="top-content" class="device-mobile device-tablet ads"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Key: Isoleucine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, the scientific community has been exploring aging, but so far, &lt;strong&gt;no one has discovered a magic cure&lt;/strong&gt; to counteract the effects of time. Nowadays, many studies target the cellular level, aiming not to reverse but to adapt the body’s mechanisms to aging. One potential avenue for this adaptation is through diet, as indicated by a study published in the journal Cell Metabolism in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study, led by the University of Wisconsin at Madison (USA), flew under the radar at the time and focuses on &lt;strong&gt;isoleucine, a very special amino acid&lt;/strong&gt;. Isoleucine is classified as an “essential” amino acid, one of the twenty major amino acids encoded by the genome for protein synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the human body does not produce isoleucine, and it &lt;strong&gt;must be obtained through diet&lt;/strong&gt;—primarily from fish, meat, eggs, legumes, dairy products, and some nuts. Essential for proper bodily function, this amino acid aids in tissue repair, energy production, and impacts several metabolic functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Risky Modification&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the American study was to test the effects of reducing isoleucine intake in mice. According to the findings, male mice experienced an &lt;strong&gt;average lifespan increase of 33%&lt;/strong&gt;, while females saw a 7% increase. Other beneficial effects noted included better regulation of blood sugar levels, an increase in muscle mass, and a reduction in the incidence of certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, there is no proof that similar results could apply to humans. It’s worth noting that our bodies are more complex than those of mice, and more importantly, &lt;strong&gt;altering the intake of an amino acid appears risky&lt;/strong&gt; as it could disrupt some biological functions undesirably. Therefore, the study’s authors do not recommend a sudden and/or uncontrolled reduction of isoleucine but instead suggest avoiding excess by choosing foods that contain it more carefully. The researchers are also considering developing a treatment to modify the biological activity of isoleucine or to modulate its absorption without making significant dietary changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although these findings are promising, &lt;strong&gt;several uncertainties remain&lt;/strong&gt;. For instance, the exact mechanisms in mice need to be accurately translated to human physiology, and the optimal dose or level of isoleucine needed to increase lifespan without causing long-term issues must still be determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Glass Almanac</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 06:25:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPTWREdmtoRG1FSkRuaDk1T2dzYjQxR0w0S0JYeEpfN09OQl9pTF9ScUoyNFJqNUZ5ZTNoZXVrOHdYSVE5LWstbzhpNDUxMUduREFlc2xnT3VvaHJBUlpnLXl2eGpGNGNMLURUeFo0TXZjMVZuSHZHb1NxSkdyb0VwclVER1hqaVRJekhIdzdObWtpNFdtd1ZoZlZQTEo</guid></item><item><title>重磅研究揭示了常见食物如何“推动自闭症的流行” -《每日邮报》 | Bombshell study reveals how common foods 'are driving epidemic of AUTISM' - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A common food in 70 percent of American diets may be fueling mental illness, dementia and autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A major new review has linked ultra-processed foods (UPFs) - which includes everything from chips to protein bars - to rising rates of neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers believe the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14719863/Scientists-discover-toxic-substance-hiding-100-peoples-brains-explains-rise-dementia-US.html"&gt;hidden culprit could be microplastics&lt;/a&gt;, tiny plastic particles now found in soaring levels inside UPFs — and increasingly, in the human brain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have shown UPFs are more susceptible to microplastics as contamination can occur during processing and packaging of the foods - which are often in plastic wrappers and containers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Co-lead author of the new paper Dr Nicholas Fabiano, from the University of Ottawa, said: 'We're seeing converging evidence that should concern us all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ultra-processed foods... contain significantly higher concentrations of microplastics than whole foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Recent findings show these particles can cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in alarming quantities.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another author of the article, Dr Wolfgang Marx from Deakin University's Food &amp;amp; Mood Center, said there is 'remarkable overlap' in the way UPFs and microplastics harm mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) - which includes everything from chips to protein bars - has been linked to rising rates of neurological disorders (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Nicholas Fabiano, from the University of Ottawa, said: 'We're seeing converging evidence that should concern us all&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained: 'This hypothesis is particularly compelling because we see remarkable overlap in biological mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ultra-processed foods have been linked to adverse mental health through inflammation, oxidative stress, epigenetics, mitochondrial dysfunction, and disruptions to neurotransmitter systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Microplastics appear to operate through remarkably similar pathways.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the new article, published in Brain Medicine, the authors reviewed studies that looked at the relationship between ultra-processed foods, microplastics and mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the studies included in the article was a recent one&lt;span&gt; published in The British Medical Journal. It found people who consumed UPFs had a 22 percent higher risk of depression, a 48 percent higher risk of anxiety and a 41 percent higher risk of poor sleep - which can cause a cascade of poor health outcomes itself. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And another study included found microplastics and nanoplastics induce oxidative stress on the central nervous system, which may cause cellular damage and increase the vulnerability to neurological disorders.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on the authors' review of the current data, they concluded the high levels of microplastic contamination in ultra-processed foods could be why they have such detrimental impacts on health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists think ultra-processed foods damage your gut, and that can in turn damage with your brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This connection — called the gut-brain axis — means when your gut's out of whack, your mood and mental health can take a hit too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has also shown that these junk foods are full of artificial sweeteners, which may throw off the way your brain cells talk to each other and disrupt hormones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On top of that, microplastics in the foods could be linked to depression and anxiety, with researchers warning they might harm brain development, trigger inflammation, and disrupt sleep and mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ultra-processed foods contain high concentrations of microplastics. Contamination can occur during processing and packaging of the foods - which are often in plastic wrappers and containers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Microplastics are small plastic pieces that are less than 5mm in size and insoluble in water&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The microplastics in UPFs could also be fueling a rise in dementia, researchers of a separate study believe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study from earlier this year - that was not included in this week's article review - analyzed brain tissue from 54 autopsies and discovered every brain had microplastics in it - equivalent in mass to a plastic spoon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found individuals diagnosed with dementia exhibited up to 10 times more microplastics in their brain tissue compared to those without this condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although the study does not directly connect them, it does show a relationship between the accumulation of microplastics and neurological disorders. SAYS WHO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An author of that study said microplastic levels in the human brain have increased by 50 percent over the past eight years - and rates of dementia have also increased, with cases expected to nearly double by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Microplastics can cross the blood-brain barrier, a protective shield that typically prevents harmful substances from entering the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once inside, these tiny particles may trigger inflammation, disrupt neurological signaling, and potentially contribute to the development of neurological disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While scientists are still investigating the direct impact of microplastics on human health, animal studies have shown that exposure can lead to behavioral changes, memory impairment, and reduced motor coordination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another separate 2022 study found people who ate the most UPFs had a 25 percent faster rate of executive function decline and a 28 percent faster rate of overall cognitive impairment compared to people who are the least amount of processed food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers believe the high content of sugar, salt and fat in UPFs promotes harmful inflammation throughout the body, including the brain, which could harm cognition and memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another neurological condition on the rise that could be tied to microplastics in UPFs is autism, which affects one in 31 kids in the US. This is a dramatic increase from one in 150 children two decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have posited UPFs can negatively impact the gut microbiome, and an off-balance microbiome has often been often in children with autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is also some evidence UPFs can alter gene expression that leads to changes in brain development and function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Processed foods can also be high in levels of heavy metals, including mercury and lead, which may contribute to or exacerbate symptoms of autism.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no known cause of autism.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While preliminary research has been conducted on the association of microplastics and autism, scientists say there is not enough information to draw conclusions and more research needs to be done. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To address the issue of microplastics, the authors of the most recent article proposed the Dietary microplastic Index (DMI). A system that would quantify exposure to microplastics through food consumption and assess the microplastic content and risk of accumulation based on the foods people eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Stefan Bornstein, who authored a peer-reviewed research paper on removing microplastics from the body, said: 'While we need to reduce our exposure to microplastics through better food choices and packaging alternatives, we also need research into how to remove these particles from the human body.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his paper, he posits that a process called apheresis could remove microplastics from the body. This is a medical procedure that removes specific components of blood from the body - like plastics - and returns the remaining components - such as the building blocks that make up blood.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — Former President Joe Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis has brought an old conversation to the forefront of headlines, and it's one that men in Utah need to hear, because right now, they have nearly the highest death rates for prostate cancer in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Huntsman Cancer Institute, 1 in 8 Utah men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime, with roughly 2,000 to 3,000 new men diagnosed every year. Compared to other states, that puts Utah at No. 21 in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to prostate cancer deaths, Utah is well above average: 1 in 40 Utah men die from the disease. That puts Utah at No. 4 in the country for prostate cancer deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is Utah men not getting screened as early as they should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other reasons for that could be Utahns' access to health care, especially in rural towns with older populations who live farther away from where they get treatment. It's part of the reason then-Vice President Biden visited the Huntsman Cancer Institute back in 2016 — to unite researchers to eliminate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other reasons for that could be Utahns' access to healthcare, especially in rural towns with older populations who live farther away from where they get treatment. It's part of the reason then-Vice President Biden visited the Huntsman Cancer Institute back in 2016 — to unite researchers to eliminate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what's the solution? Johnson said men need to be screened for prostate cancer starting at age 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's now a simple blood test you can take, he said. But if you have a family history of prostate cancer, you may want to get screened sooner. At a bare minimum, 50 is the age men need to start talking with doctors about screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still not sure?
