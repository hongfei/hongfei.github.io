This has sparked renewed interest in a largely untapped yet promising resource: Nigeria’s indigenous food plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These plants – including their leaves, seeds, tubers, and fruits – are loaded with bioactive compounds. Laboratory studies show that many of these natural substances have the potential to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/many-plant-species-show-great-promise-in-fight-against-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;slow or even halt&lt;/a&gt; tumor growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing body of evidence suggests that these plants, long consumed as part of the traditional diet, could be developed as low-cost, complementary tools in the nation’s fight against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-plants-that-prevent-or-halt-cancer"&gt;Plants that prevent or halt cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have catalogued dozens of edible Nigerian species with measurable &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-is-the-next-frontier-in-cancer-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anti-cancer activity&lt;/a&gt;, but nine stand out for the breadth of experimental data already available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spondias mombin&lt;/em&gt; (hog plum) contains the flavonoid quercetin along with carotenoids that trigger apoptosis – the “self-destruct” program in malignant cells – while simultaneously tamping down inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xanthosoma sagittifolium&lt;/em&gt;, a cocoyam cultivated widely in the humid south, produces tannins and other phenolics that cause leukemia cells to stall in the cell-cycle, blocking proliferation and reducing the formation of new blood vessels that tumors need in order to expand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil palm (&lt;em&gt;Elaeis guineensis&lt;/em&gt;) is often maligned for ecological reasons, yet its vitamin-E–rich tocotrienols are potent antioxidants; in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plant-based-diet-improves-health-in-women-with-breast-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; models they lower cell viability and force cells into arrest, nudging them toward death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Irvingia gabonensis&lt;/em&gt;, the African bush mango, supplies gallotannins that regulate metabolic pathways linked to tumorigenesis and stimulate immune surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-powerful-cancer-fighting-plant-compounds"&gt;Powerful cancer-fighting plant compounds &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Allium cepa&lt;/em&gt;, the humble onion, is packed with organosulphur compounds as well as flavonoids that up-regulate detoxification enzymes, mop up DNA-damaging free radicals and may even help reverse multidrug resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blighia sapida&lt;/em&gt; (ackee) fruit, famous for its culinary role in Caribbean cuisine, also grows in Nigeria; laboratory work shows its flavonoids can hamper the ERK5 pathway, a key driver of aggressive breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dioscorea dumetorum&lt;/em&gt;, a wild yam, synthesizes diosgenin – long prized in the pharmaceutical industry as a raw material for steroid hormones – which shuts off the pro-survival NF-κB and MAPK cascades in cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/04/29123423/plants_anti-cancer-properties_nigeria_credit-google-photos_1m.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/04/29123432/plants_anti-cancer-properties_nigeria_credit-google-photos_1s.webp" alt="Selected edible Nigerian plants with anti-cancer properties.

Angiogenesis – the sprouting of new blood vessels that feed a tumor – is another frequent target. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compounds from cocoyam, yam and hog plum have been shown to lower levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and related signals, choking off the nutrient supply to nascent tumors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory enzymes (COX-2, iNOS) and reactive oxygen species are suppressed as well, reducing the chronic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fasting-helps-the-body-fight-inflammation-and-chronic-diseases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and oxidative stress that often initiate or accelerate malignancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bridging-tradition-and-modern-oncology"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Bridging tradition and modern oncology&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While pre-clinical data are encouraging, several hurdles must be cleared before Nigerian food plants can take their place beside paclitaxel or cisplatin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bioactive composition varies by soil type, rainfall pattern and harvest time; rigorous agronomic studies are needed to standardize cultivation and extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dosage, toxicity and potential interactions with conventional drugs remain largely untested in humans. Well-designed clinical trials – randomized, placebo-controlled and sufficiently powered – are essential if these botanicals are to earn a formal role in oncology clinics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another challenge is the disconnect between traditional knowledge holders and laboratory scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethnobotanical surveys can help bridge that gap, ensuring that leads chosen for development reflect community practices and dietary realities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public-health campaigns, meanwhile, could educate physicians, pharmacists, and patients about the evidence base for plant-derived adjuncts, avoiding unsubstantiated claims while highlighting genuine benefits such as reduced side-effects or improved &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/active-aging-physical-activity-has-a-direct-impact-on-life-quality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;quality of life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cost-effective-renewable-treatments"&gt;Cost-effective, renewable treatments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these hurdles are overcome, the payoff could be substantial. Many of the plants grow wild or are already farmed for food, implying a local, renewable supply chain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extracts could be formulated as teas, capsules or functional foods, lowering barriers to access in rural areas where oncology centers are scarce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining plant-based agents with lower doses of chemotherapy or radiation might retain efficacy while mitigating nausea, hair loss, and myelosuppression – side-effects that often deter patients from completing treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fighting-cancer-with-plants-future-research"&gt;Fighting cancer with plants: Future research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research should prioritize mapping the full chemoprofile of each candidate plant. This should also include identifying synergistic combinations and unravelling pharmacokinetics in vivo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genomic and metabolomic tools can accelerate the discovery of lead molecules, while &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-nanotechnology-is-fighting-microplastic-pollution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nanotechnology&lt;/a&gt; may enhance their bioavailability. Collaboration between Nigerian universities, pharmaceutical firms, and international cancer institutes will be vital to secure funding and regulatory approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Nigeria’s indigenous food plants harbor a rich arsenal of anticancer phytochemicals that attack tumours through multiple, complementary pathways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrated with evidence-based medicine, these botanicals could broaden the therapeutic arsenal, reduce treatment costs and bring culturally familiar options to patients. Harnessing the plants may demand careful science, but the potential rewards will justify the effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.xiahepublishing.com/2835-6357/FIM-2024-00042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Future Integrative Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-ralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 19:40:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxQUXBlVkZ0ZnhtcnRRZGVEX3ozNDZnR084aTd6eGM2UHlES3ctNXQ3eFRHemR3dFlMLUZOMkpOM3JVSGhLWkF2V0lOc2FEMFBmbUpTdkNEcVBubnlBUVpYNzB6aE9QSG5QZGsyVzhPbm92bG5DbUJEVTdmeTFxTW84MkhGOVdSTXVIcjVVTGZ3</guid></item><item><title>发现有助于一些患者避免手术的实验性抗癌药物-《华盛顿邮报》 | Experimental cancer drugs found to help some patients avoid surgery - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPSHdvTzZjOGMzcWJaYU5aUXVxRlM1bmliVmRiWFpveGZuc01xd2xMYWhzcTdRd1pwWlY1OFlCOVBWZnVFcWdILTZnVWQ1LVVMZ0c3b1YwX0FIMWlWc2dIZHpZcWZkdV9Cc1JFOVlJMTNUVm03SklCM2Y1dEU4bWhqRmJaQ2JqY2lQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PK2ITMOXTVDGBOZWS5UMP2PL4M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The results from an ambitious cancer study are giving hope that immunotherapy drugs alone can treat some gastrointestinal tumors, eliminating the need for severe, life-altering surgeries and other harsh therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YUKQMWDLJVEM7JQOAVSJH6FPHE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For as long as cancer treatment has existed, “cutting it out has been the best way to cure it,” said Luis Diaz, a gastrointestinal medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and one of the co-leaders of the study, along with Andrea Cercek, also a gastrointestinal&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;medical oncologist with MSK. “This is a complete paradigm shift.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O3QPFYKDHRG73GEH3IOZ26JVWI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The approach “gives patients more agency in determining how they want to approach their treatment based on chances of survivorship, but also quality of life and side effects,” said Karen Knudsen, CEO of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at the University of California at San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CVYBZ526X5CLRA555W5CZCXUME" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study enrolled 103 patients with hard tumors from gastrointestinal cancers affecting organs such as the stomach, bladder and intestines that normally would be treated with surgery. All had tumors with mutations, called mismatch repair deficiencies, that prevent cells from fixing DNA damage. These types of mutations occur in 2 to 3 percent of all cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5XFG3DHGJRDLZHAL5PCRQ576X4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Eighty percent of patients treated with an immunotherapy drug, dostarlimab, did not require chemotherapy, radiation or surgery, including organ removal, the trial found. That included all 49 patients with rectal cancers, who saw their tumors disappear completely after six months of treatment, with no recurrence at five years. Thirty-five of 54 patients with tumors in places such as the colon, bladder, esophagus and stomach saw their cancer disappear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JFMKDAVUN5F5DNL7QYAUPSYVXU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Diaz and his team shared the results Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research and &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2404512" target="_blank"&gt;published them&lt;/a&gt; in the New England Journal of Medicine. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/06/08/cancer-drug-trial/" target="_blank"&gt;The trial results build on the groundbreaking first phase of the study&lt;/a&gt;, which debuted at the same conference in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XRQLPCF2UBDMTPRDTFRWEP7JYM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;During Phase 1, which was conducted in 2020, a tiny sample of 14 patients with early-stage rectal cancer were given dostarlimab. The tumors in all 14 patients vanished after six months of the experimental treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TWQO2PDKFJHBRDX4DM5SADCOEQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The second phase of the trial added patients with solid, non-rectal tumors. Patients received a 500-milligram dose of dostarlimab intravenously every three weeks, for a total of nine treatments. Almost 40 percent of patients had no side effects at all, Diaz said; some patients experienced mild rashes or itching, while a smaller number experienced more serious lung infections and encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YI3DNPSS7VFN5LWGTZ3CQ2EDR4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Diaz is hopeful dostarlimab will become an available option for the small number of cancer patients with mismatch repair mutations — and that it becomes eligible for insurance reimbursement. (The drug costs about $11,500 a vial, and nine doses are required). The Food and Drug Administration in December gave pharmaceutical company GSK’s dostarlimab drug Jemperli a &lt;a href="https://www.targetedonc.com/view/fda-grants-dostarlimab-breakthrough-therapy-designation-in-dmmr-msi-h-rectal-cancer" target="_blank"&gt;breakthrough therapy designation&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to accelerate development and review of drugs that could represent a significant step forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NFEKQKVW55HBTFWHWAHYNUTUSQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For patients, especially younger ones, the value of being able to treat these types of tumors without surgery is immense, Diaz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YUOMISIC4NEQNLJW5PKLUTANWE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Imagine being in your 20s and having to lose an organ in your body that will change how you interact with the world, change your fertility, change sexual function or change just your quality of life in general,” he said. “People can adapt, but it’s certainly a very different outlook.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZL5YXH3DTNBRTFV4FCNYZRXSE4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In 2020, Kelly Spill was initially unsure what her choices — or even prognosis — would be when she was diagnosed with Stage 3 colorectal cancer at 28 years old. She had given birth to her son eight months earlier and was planning her wedding with her now-husband when she learned she was among the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/07/31/cancer-rates-younger-generations/" target="_blank"&gt;growing cohort of young people developing cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6UW35NU6DBCAZBNFEDOELLOEUU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I never really dreamed of having a big wedding; I never dreamed of just having that white dress. But I always dreamed of having a family,” said Spill, now 33. Going the route of oral radiation and chemotherapy treatment would have not only destroyed her fertility; it also would have impaired sexual function, and she would have needed to wear a colostomy bag for the rest of her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4GBOZ7VSEJDI3MAH7BYDUK3IEA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Hearing that at 28 years old is just so scary,” Spill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YIHRBFWA3ZFSTFTSG7JITP3EN4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When a research nurse told Spill that her test results indicated she might have other options, Spill looked at her mother, who encouraged her to try the experimental route, and she became the fourth patient to enroll in Phase 1 of the trial.

&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that Parkinson’s often is not diagnosed until the disease is in its later stages, and its hallmark symptoms, like tremor and walking problems, are more evident. By that time, however, the brain is often irreversibly damaged, per the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this novel test, which measures a protein called alpha-synuclein that is misfolded in Parkinson’s patients, is showing promise for helping reliably diagnose Parkinson’s disease — even in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the future it could be used to monitor disease progression, guide treatment decisions, and accelerate the development of new drugs,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The test uses samples of CSF, collected via a spinal tap, to directly test misfolded alpha-synuclein — a molecular hallmark of Parkinson’s and related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists detailed their findings in “&lt;a href="https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/s44321-025-00229-z"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alpha-synuclein misfolding as fluid biomarker for Parkinson’s disease measured with the iRS platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” a study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;EMBO Molecular Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Use of new technique may allow Parkinson’s diagnosis at early stage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-causes-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s is caused&lt;/a&gt; by a progressive loss of the brain’s dopaminergic neurons, which are the nerve cells that produce dopamine, a signaling molecule essential for motor control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-tests-diagnosis/"&gt;Diagnosing&lt;/a&gt; the condition mainly relies on the onset of &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/motor/"&gt;motor symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, including slowness of movement, medically known as bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremors, and postural instability. Still, by the time of symptom onset, the disease is often advanced, with more than half of the dopaminergic neurons already lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is an unmet medical need for fluid biomarkers to improve diagnostic accuracy based on a biological classification,” the researchers wrote. The team noted that such biomarkers already have been established for &lt;a href="https://alzheimersnewstoday.com/what-is-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, which also is marked by progressive neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Parkinson’s patients, the misfolding of the protein alpha-synuclein into toxic clumps called Lewy bodies is thought to interfere with the function of dopaminergic neurons and contribute to their death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Klaus Gerwert, PhD, a study lead, noted that “these misfoldings make the protein sticky, leading to the formation of larger complexes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those complexes are known as oligomers, according to Gerwert, founding and managing director at the Center for Protein Diagnostics at Ruhr University Bochum (PRODI) in Germany, and CEO of &lt;a href="https://www.beta-sense.de/en/"&gt;Betasense&lt;/a&gt;, a university spinoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The oligomers then produce long fibrillar filaments and cause the aggregation of these filaments into macroscopically large Lewy bodies in the brain,” Gerwaert said in a &lt;a href="https://news.rub.de/english/press-releases/2025-04-25-biophysics-new-body-fluid-biomarker-parkinsons-disease-discovered"&gt;university news story&lt;/a&gt; on the team’s discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers from PRODI and Betasense found that measuring misfolded alpha-synuclein in the CSF — using this new technique — can aid in reliably diagnosing Parkinson’s at an early stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technique is based on a patented immuno-infrared sensor (iRS) platform technology from Betasense, which can directly detect folded versus misfolded alpha-synuclein in bodily fluids that absorb different wavelengths of light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iRS technology has already been applied to Alzheimer’s, which is characterized by the misfolding of amyloid-beta in the brain. A &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.12745"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; showed it was able to assess the risk of Alzheimer’s dementia at a later stage with high accuracy, up to 17 years before diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have now transferred this approach to Parkinson’s for the misfolding of [alpha-synuclein],” Gerwert said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Test for Parkinson’s disease uses same approach as one for Alzheimer’s&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team used the iRS platform to test 134 CSF samples. The discovery group involved 59 individuals, of whom 17 were diagnosed with Parkinson’s. The remaining 42 people, who had no signs of neurodegenerative diseases, served as controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The validation group consisted of 75 individuals, 40 of whom had Parkinson’s and five with &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/types-of-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;multiple system atrophy&lt;/a&gt; (MSA), a neurodegenerative disorder with similar symptoms to Parkinson’s. Because misfolding of alpha-synuclein is also known to occur in MSA, both Parkinson’s and MSA patients were called the misfolding-positive group. All other participants were grouped as one disease control. That group comprised those with corticobasal degeneration, frontotemporal dementia, and progressive supranuclear palsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the team demonstrated that the ratio of two iRS wavelengths of light, 1656.0 to 1623.5 per cm, significantly distinguished between folded and misfolded alpha-synuclein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, using this ratio, the researchers found the ability to distinguish Parkinson’s/MSA patients from controls was 90% in the discovery group and 86% in the validation group. When both datasets were combined, the classification accuracy was 90%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;The structure-based biomarker … now enables a biological classification for [Parkinson’s disease] for timely identification and intervention, potentially slowing the disease progression and improving patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the levels of the wavelength ratio, the participants were then grouped again. One group comprised individuals with high levels of misfolded alpha-synuclein, indicating they likely had Parkinson’s or MSA. The other had those with low levels, who did not show signs of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When comparing just these two groups, the test identified Parkinson’s or MSA with 95% accuracy. It correctly detected 97% of people who had the disease (sensitivity) and correctly identified 92% of people who did not have it (specificity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iRS readings that fell between these two levels, referred to as the intermediate group, reflected a continuum of misfolding between a healthy and diseased state. These individuals may have an elevated risk of developing diseases related to alpha-synuclein misfolding compared with unaffected individuals, the team noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The structure-based biomarker, which is already established for Alzheimer’s, now enables a biological classification for [Parkinson’s disease] for timely identification and intervention, potentially slowing the disease progression and improving patient outcomes,” the researchers wrote in detailing the study’s impact.&lt;/p&gt;

Strong, healthy muscles &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-esm/fulltext/2023/01000/the_health_benefits_of_resistance_exercise__beyond.2.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;help protect us&lt;/a&gt; against diabetes, arthritis and a range of other diseases, as well as frailty and premature death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="T7G6IW5I75DGNMW3SSXQWNRLEM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But few of us lift.

Many worry, too, that weight training requires complex equipment and arcane expertise about loads, reps and other lifting matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GQ2QZ4CVL5GV5O6MNXAU6JL3HU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So, for the study, published in April in Medicine &amp;amp; Science in Sports &amp;amp; Exercise, Schoenfeld and his collaborators put together a speedy, simple, full-body, gym-based workout, with exercises focused on the shoulders, arms, legs, back and core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4UPUQNTPAZEKBHE4ZXOTPEIRXA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Then they rounded up a group of healthy men and women, ages 18 to 40, who already did some resistance training. This lifting experience was important because an effective minimalist approach should be able to continue building muscle mass and strength, even in muscles that already are somewhat strong and buff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="C777KA4AVRGHJAHMFEOGFMV7FQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="C777KA4AVRGHJAHMFEOGFMV7FQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Is a half-hour workout enough?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XOPMOXFKB5BM5HEUGCNVWTYZWM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The scientists invited their volunteers to the gym twice a week, for supervised sessions, where everyone did the same nine exercises:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="BFNSVMQV2ZFP3OFFFLFSXE2MYA" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Front lat pull-down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Seated cable row.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shoulder press.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chest press.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cable triceps pushdown.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Supinated dumbbell biceps curl.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Smith machine squats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Leg press.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Leg extension.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VKLPUNXVSVGF3DNFGJPSWCM77I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At first, the researchers set people’s weights so they could complete, at most, 10 repetitions of each move before they simply couldn’t manage another, a condition known as reaching failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NZB5IQQJPNCAZHZLIJM6QFJR4A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Half of the volunteers continued to lift to failure every time. The other half backed off, lifting until their muscles felt challenged and tired but hadn’t reached failure; they could’ve eked out a few more repetitions, if they’d had to.

Substitute &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2025/7-minute-workout-science-original/" target="_blank"&gt;body weight exercises&lt;/a&gt; like pull-ups or push-ups for some of the exercises, he said, or ask a trainer at your gym to show you the machines there that work the shoulders, biceps, back, core and legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GGCAFJTY4JHIXG46ZPSOITET2E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you’re new to lifting, the trainer could be especially useful, Schoenfeld added, to teach you proper form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4TAB4RKC6JGQ3KR6LXADGJGUDU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the key to lifting for muscle health will always be simple consistency, he said.

Leave at least one day between each session, but otherwise Tuesdays and Thursdays, or Fridays and Mondays, or Sundays and Wednesdays, or whatever works for you should be fine, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PZAGHS5YSVFEVP3GMSGLBEYB74" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This study was relatively short-term, lasting only eight weeks, and involved mostly healthy adults. It’s “quite likely” but not certain that the results apply equally to older people and other groups, Schoenfeld said, and that the benefits continue past two months.

Now, researchers have uncovered key reasons why this happens, offering hope for new ways to combat age-related weight gain and metabolic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Middle Age Unlocks Fat Cell Growth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In new research published in &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adj0430" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Science;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;, scientists at City of Hope and &lt;a href="https://www.ucla.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UCLA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt; revealed that aging triggers a hidden switch in your body’s fat-making system. Qiong (Annabel) Wang, Ph.D., an associate professor at &lt;a href="https://www.cityofhope.org/research/riggs-institute" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:City of Hope’s Arthur Riggs Diabetes &amp;amp; Metabolism Research Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;City of Hope’s Arthur Riggs Diabetes &amp;amp; Metabolism Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;, explained that aging awakens a new type of adult stem cell that fuels fat production around your abdomen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People often lose muscle and gain body fat as they age—even when their body weight remains the same,” Wang said. Her team focused on white adipose tissue, or WAT, the primary kind of fat tissue that grows with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Adipose tissue, which contains fat cells (shown red-yellow in this scanning electron micrograph). (CREDIT: STEVE GSCHMEISSNER/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY/GETTY IMAGES)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team suspected that more was happening than just the enlargement of existing fat cells. They proposed that the body might be creating an entirely new batch of fat cells as you age, especially around the belly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this, Wang and her colleagues transplanted adipocyte progenitor cells, or APCs, from both young and middle-aged mice into young mice. They observed that APCs from older mice quickly produced a flood of new &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/crispr-transforms-ordinary-fat-cells-into-cancer-killing-machines/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fat cells;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fat cells&lt;/a&gt;, while APCs from young mice barely generated any new cells even when placed into older bodies. This proved that aging, not environment, unlocked a powerful ability in these cells to make fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A New Type of Fat-Making Stem Cell Emerges&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using single-cell &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/hackers-turning-dna-sequencing-biosecurity-000700607.html" data-ylk="slk:RNA sequencing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;RNA sequencing&lt;/a&gt;, the team closely studied the behavior of these APCs. They discovered that while APCs stayed mostly dormant in young mice, they became highly active during middle age. They produced many new fat cells, particularly around the midsection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more surprising, the researchers found that aging transformed APCs into a new type of stem cell they named committed preadipocytes, age-specific (CP-As). These CP-As multiplied rapidly and had a strong ability to generate new fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adolfo Garcia-Ocana, Ph.D., chair of the Department of Molecular &amp;amp; Cellular Endocrinology at City of Hope, pointed out the significance of this discovery: “While most &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/scientists-create-synthetic-cells-shape-180700817.html" data-ylk="slk:adult stem cells;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;adult stem cells&lt;/a&gt;’ capacity to grow wanes with age, the opposite holds true with APCs—aging unlocks these cells’ power to evolve and spread. This is the first evidence that our bellies expand with age due to the APCs’ high output of new fat cells.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team's research showed that CP-As arise specifically during middle age and continue fueling fat buildup through early aging, providing new insights into why visceral fat is so difficult to control after your forties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Graphical abstract. Adipogenesis contributes to age-related visceral adipose tissue accumulation. (CREDIT: Science)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A Crucial Signaling Pathway Fuels Belly Fat&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists then identified a key signaling pathway that made this fat-boosting process possible. A protein receptor called the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) was found to be critical in promoting the CP-A cells’ ability to multiply and form new fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We discovered that the body’s fat-making process is driven by LIFR. While young mice don't require this signal to make fat, older mice do,” Wang explained. Without LIFR, CP-As could not generate fat as aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding opens exciting possibilities for medical interventions. Targeting the LIFR pathway could eventually help prevent or slow down &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/does-body-fat-affect-your-risk-of-alzheimers-or-parkinsons/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:belly fat accumulation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;belly fat accumulation&lt;/a&gt; in middle-aged and older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To confirm their results applied to humans, the researchers studied APCs from people of different ages. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed similar CP-A cells appearing in middle-aged individuals, just like in mice. These human CP-As also showed strong fat-producing abilities, suggesting that similar biological mechanisms drive age-related weight gain across species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Adipogenesis increases in middle-aged mice and correlates with visceral adiposity. (CREDIT: Science)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why Middle-Age Belly Fat Matters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belly fat is more than a cosmetic issue. It increases the risk for a host of serious conditions, including insulin resistance, heart disease, and other metabolic disorders. Even if your body mass index stays the same, a rise in visceral fat during middle age can shorten your healthy lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has shown that WAT plays a vital role in regulating hormones and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-class-of-drugs-target-brain-metabolism-to-treat-alzheimers-patients/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:metabolism;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;. It has great plasticity, meaning it can change composition and behavior based on your body’s needs. As energy expenditure slows with age and tissues change, WAT undergoes remodeling, adding to health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, it remained unclear how much of middle-age fat gain was due to simply enlarging existing fat cells versus creating new ones. Earlier work suggested that new fat cell formation, known as adipogenesis, slowed with age. But Wang’s study overturned this belief, showing that, at least in &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/green-mediterranean-diets-can-significantly-reduce-body-fat/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:visceral fat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;visceral fat&lt;/a&gt;, adipogenesis actually ramps up during middle age because of CP-As.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also explained why older adults can experience sarcopenic obesity—gaining fat while losing muscle—even if their overall weight does not change much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;High adipogenic rate of APCs in middle-aged mice. (CREDIT: Science)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;New Paths Toward Healthier Aging&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will now focus on tracking CP-A cells more closely in living animals and in &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/smallest-ever-rechargeable-lithium-battery-180700165.html" data-ylk="slk:human tissues;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;human tissues&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists also aim to explore treatments that could eliminate or suppress these cells. Blocking CP-A formation or the LIFR signaling pathway might one day help middle-aged people maintain leaner bodies and enjoy longer, healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings highlight the importance of controlling new fat-cell formation to address age-related obesity," said Wang. "Understanding the role of CP-As in &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/global-study-links-height-to-heart-metabolic-and-mental-health-risks/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:metabolic disorders;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;metabolic disorders&lt;/a&gt; and how these cells emerge during aging could lead to new medical solutions for reducing belly fat and improving health and longevity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first authors of the study, Guan Wang, Ph.D. from City of Hope and Gaoyan Li, Ph.D. from UCLA, played major roles in driving this research forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With continued study, the mysteries behind belly fat and aging are becoming clearer. And with that understanding comes new hope for healthier, more vibrant years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: The article above provided above by &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Brighter Side of News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Brighter Side of News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like these kind of feel good stories?

                Community health worker Geoffrey Chanda used to distribute HIV medications to long-haul truck drivers and sex workers at truck stops like this one near the border of Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;On a morning in early April, Geoffrey Chanda's phone was going off almost constantly. Truck drivers were calling him.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They are crying: 'We've got no [HIV] medicine. Where do you get [it] from?' " says Chanda, 54.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For 15 years, Chanda has been meeting truckers in dusty parking lots at the border of Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo to give them their HIV medications. Now, he says, he doesn't know what to tell them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He's lost his job as a community health worker. The U.S.-funded program he worked for — which supported the mobile clinic where he collected the medications for distribution — shut down.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;On inauguration night — 100 days ago this week — the U.S. froze the vast majority of foreign aid, including billions of dollars in programs addressing global health issues. Since then most of the freezes have turned to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/04/11/g-s1-58942/usaid-humanitarian-aid-canceled" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;terminations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At first glance, it would seem as if Chanda's job should have been spared.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We are continuing essential lifesaving programs," Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/on-delivering-an-america-first-foreign-assistance-program/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; issued&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;on March 28. "We are reorienting our foreign assistance programs to align directly with what is best for the United States and our citizens."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The continuation of lifesaving programs, the Trump Administration says, include the distribution of HIV medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, on the ground in Zambia, a different reality is apparent. Many HIV-clinics have shut their doors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A State Department spokesperson said in a statement to NPR this month that U.S. partners who are providing lifesaving HIV treatment have been "notified and urged to resume approved service delivery." The spokesperson did not respond to requests for information about specific actions the U.S. has taken to resume HIV services in Zambia and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As of this week, Chanda says he's heard nothing about restarting his work delivering HIV medications, although a limited number of other U.S.-funded HIV clinics in Zambia have restarted with significantly reduced capacity.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Still, Chanda spends his days picking up a string of calls from truck drivers and sex workers who haven't been able to collect their HIV medications since the end of January — and are now getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracking the truckers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Chanda started this work 15 years ago as a volunteer but, after his own brother died of AIDS in 2018, he decided to do it full time. " 'Let me teach others not to get [HIV],' " he remembers thinking to himself.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Leaving his job as a miner underground, Chanda moved above ground, spending his days in those dusty parking lots where 18-wheelers line up, many loaded down with freshly-mined minerals. While the drivers were waiting for clearance from government authorities to cross the border, Chanda would make sure those who needed HIV drugs had them before hitting the road again.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He was responsible for coordinating with over 200 truck drivers — as well as more than 150 sex workers. Calling and texting them, he'd figure out when they'd be passing through the border crossing and go meet them armed with their pills and all the information they needed about how not to spread HIV. He'd also helped identify people who were HIV-negative but at high-risk of getting HIV, to help them get information as well as medication that prevents people from getting the virus in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59797" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Long-haul truckers sometimes pause for days at this truck stop near the Zambian town of Chililabombwe as they await approval to cross the border into the Democratic Republic of Congo. Distributing HIV medicine on trucking routes is critical to stopping the spread of HIV, say public health experts.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reaching those at high risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Chanda was part of a broader effort in Zambia and elsewhere to zero in on this population of long-haul truck drivers and sex workers because they're seen as critical in halting the spread of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the early days of the epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa, the virus fanned out along trucking routes as long-haul drivers frequented sex workers. At the peak of the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1990s and early 2000s, these communities were very hard hit — for example, &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03768350500253153#d1e1004" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;one study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from 2001 found that in South Africa 56% of truck drivers surveyed were HIV-positive. Still today, worldwide, long-haul truck drivers are nearly six times as likely as the general adult population to be HIV-positive, according to &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/14/8/e085058.share" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published last year in &lt;em&gt;BMJ Open.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Zambia sits at a key crossroads on the HIV/AIDS map. The landlocked country in southern Africa is bordered by eight other countries and major transport corridors crisscross the nation. Zambia is heavily dependent on its long-haul truck drivers, in part to export all the copper mined in the country.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So public health experts in Zambia have designed special initiatives to reach this high-risk population. People like Chanda were a key part of the strategy, often working long days under the hot sun to make sure that highly mobile truck drivers — and the highly stigmatized sex workers that they patronize — have access to consistent HIV care and prevention services.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, Chanda says he's alarmed to learn that many of his former clients are getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On that day in early April, Chanda estimated that about 20 of the 200 truck drivers he worked with have called and told him they're falling ill without their HIV medications. In the arcades and bars that line the main street of Chililabombwe, near the border between Zambia and Congo, Chanda has heard that one of his drivers passed away in Congo because he didn't have his HIV medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"He died in Congo. [And] bringing the body [back to Zambia], it's very expensive," says long-haul truck driver Roi Silunyange, 54, who knew the deceased man.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-60043" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Mwape Shamboko, another driver, standing nearby in the lot that April morning, used to rely on health workers like Chanda and the U.S.-funded system to get his HIV medications. He says there was even an emergency number any driver or sex worker could call if something were amiss. Community health workers like Chanda would pick up.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you're not feeling well, or you need a supply — maybe your medicines have run out — [we] would call that number, and [the community health workers] were always very quick at coming to us and responding to our needs," Mwape says. "So it was a very, very good system. We were not missing our medications."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59796" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Now, he says, the calls go unanswered. Or if someone does pick up – as Chanda still does – they are unable to help.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No more preventive HIV care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Like the truck drivers, sex workers are also feeling a sense of abandonment. They too report major disruptions in getting their HIV medications – as well as the end of most HIV prevention efforts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They say this is a major problem because their line of work is so risky. Many of the towns that fly past on the roadside have little work available for the residents, pushing young women into prostitution as one of the only ways to make a living.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-63302" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Mercy Lungu is a 27-year-old sex worker from Kitwe, Zambia. She is HIV negative but worries that because the local U.S.-funded clinics have shut down, she won't be able to get access to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/07/03/g-s1-7988/hiv-prevention-drug-clinical-trial" target="_blank"&gt;PrEP&lt;/a&gt; — a medication that prevents a person from contracting HIV.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Mercy Lungu, 27, is one of those women. She's a sex worker in Kitwe, Zambia. And, while she's HIV-negative, she knows the HIV is common in her world: &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8386187/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;One study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the African Journal of AIDS Research from 2021 includes estimates that, in Zambia, between 46% and 73% of female sex workers are HIV-positive, compared to roughly 11% of the general population.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She says she would "love" to have access to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/07/03/g-s1-7988/hiv-prevention-drug-clinical-trial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PrEP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — a medication that prevents a person from contracting HIV. But, she says, the local U.S-funded clinics where her fellow sex workers used to get PrEP have shut down. "When we go there, you find that the staff – they are not there," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even if those clinics were to reopen — as the State Department has said that it's urging — there's another issue. The pills that prevent HIV may not be available. While the Trump Administration says lifesaving aid, like HIV medication, is allowed to continue, preventive HIV care has not been included in their definition of "lifesaving" — with the exception of prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-63304" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Juliet Banda (left) and Mercy Lungu (right) say that the closure of U.S.-funded HIV clinics has sent fear through the sex worker community. "If I am to contract HIV today, and then I don't have access to medication, then it's scary," Banda says. "Even for my colleagues who are [HIV positive and] in this business, we're really worried."

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;This doesn't make sense to Juliet Banda, a 26-year-old sex worker also in Kitwe. "We do a lot of movement and a lot of interactions — we sleep with multiple partners — so I think when we think about people like us, [we] need the PrEP," she says. "Because that's what will help us to safeguard our lives."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;She says the closure of U.S.-funded HIV clinics has sent fear through the sex worker community.

"Even for my colleagues who are [HIV positive and] in this business, we're really worried."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Geoffrey Chanda says this sense of worry weighs heavily on him too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says each time his phone rings he worries it's another former client who's without HIV pills and now ill.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And on top of that, he says, now he worries for himself too — and his six children. Without his job, he's struggling to pay for food for his family. "[We are] still starving with hunger," he texted this week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, isn’t without its risks. A recent study has found that tens of thousands of Americans have ended up in the emergency room from taking semaglutide over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention led the research, &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-03258"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this month in Annals of Internal Medicine. Based on national surveillance data, the researchers estimate that semaglutide contributed to nearly 25,000 ER visits between 2022 and 2023, usually from gastrointestinal complications. The findings suggest that doctors can do more to mitigate the potentially severe side effects of these drugs, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Semaglutide and similar drugs mimic GLP-1, one of several hormones that play a key role in regulating our metabolism and hunger. GLP-1 drugs have existed for over two decades, but semaglutide is part of a newer and more effective generation. It was first approved in 2017 to treat type 2 diabetes under the brand name Ozempic. In 2021, it was approved to treat obesity under the brand name Wegovy. Since then, doctors have also commonly prescribed Ozempic off-label for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every drug comes with its side effects, however. People taking GLP-1s commonly experience nausea, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms. Usually, these side effects are mild and/or tend to decline over time. But in some cases, they can become serious enough to warrant emergency medical care.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CDC researchers analyzed data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance Project (&lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/data-sources-and-methods/data-sources/national-electronic-injury-surveillance-system-cooperative-adverse-drug-event-surveillance-project-neiss-cades"&gt;NEISS-CADES&lt;/a&gt;), which keeps track of drug-related adverse events reported to a nationally representative sample of emergency departments in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Based on 551 documented cases, the researchers estimated that 24,499 ER visits were attributable to semaglutide use between 2022 and 2023. Nearly 70% of these visits involved GI symptoms, while roughly 17% involved hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), and about 6% represented allergic reactions. About a third of hypoglycemia-related visits led to hospitalization, as did 15% of GI-related visits.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The findings should be taken in some context. Many drugs can cause side effects that could result in an ER visit, including common over-the-counter medications. In a 2021 study from many of the same authors, they found that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8493432/#:~:text=Based%20on%2096%E2%80%89925%20cases%20(mean%20patient%20age%2C%2049%20years%3B%2055%25%20female)%2C%20there%20were%20an%20estimated%206.1%20(95%25%20CI%2C%204.8%2D7.5)%20ED%20visits%20for%20medication%20harms%20per%201000%20population%20annually%20and%2038.6%25%20(95%25%20CI%2C%2035.2%25%2D41.9%25)%20resulted%20in%20hospitalization."&gt;roughly 1 in 200 Americans&lt;/a&gt; visit the ER each year due to medication-related harms, for instance, with two-thirds caused by therapeutic use (meaning that the drugs were taken to treat a medical problem, not recreationally). A 2022 study by the same team &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34757641/"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that OTC cough or cold medications cause about 27,000 ER visits in the U.S. annually.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the results of this latest study shouldn’t be minimized either. More than 82% of the ER visits happened in 2023, suggesting that as semaglutide use has surged, so have its potential harms. About 9% of the visits involved medication errors, such as people taking more than instructed. So we might be able to prevent some ER visits with better patient education. In other cases, doctors could lower their patients’ risk of serious complications by better managing their use of other medications, and at the very least, they can probably do more to prepare their patients in advance before starting GLP-1 therapy, the researchers argue.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Clinicians could counsel patients when initiating semaglutide about the potential for severe gastrointestinal adverse effects and adjust co-prescribed antidiabetic medications to decrease hypoglycemia risk,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cacio e pepe is made by cooking pasta and using the resulting starchy water to create a sauce with grated cheese and pepper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now researchers recommend that the perfect recipe for two involves dissolving 5g of powdered starch in 50g of water rather than using the reserved pasta water&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– as traditional recipes do. Then, heat the mixture gently until it thickens and turns clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Next, add 100g of water to cool the mixture, before blending it with 200g of cheese and adding toasted black pepper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The resulting sauce should then be mixed with 300g of pasta that has been cooked in slightly salted water until it is al dente, drained and allowed to cool slightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This step helps prevent the excessive heat from destabilising the sauce. Finally, they say a little reserved starchy water can be used to adjust the consistency as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“A true Italian grandmother or a skilled home chef from Rome would never need a scientific recipe for cacio e pepe, relying instead on instinct and years of experience,” the researchers write. “For everyone else, this guide offers a practical way to master the dish.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Ivan Di Terlizzi, one of the co-authors of the research, said the team consumed about 6kg of cheese for the study, with “most of it eaten with bread”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Although we are still not tired of this delicious dish, one of the authors had blood tests showing very high cholesterol levels,” he added. “It’s the price of science!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“When heated, cheese proteins change their configuration and, therefore, aggregate,” said Dr Daniel Busiello, another co-author of the study from Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. Starch, he said, mitigates this effect by binding to the cheese proteins, reducing their direct interactions and hence their formation of clumps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;To explore the secret to a smooth and creamy sauce, researchers carried out a number of experiments using a fixed cheese-to-water ratio, but with varying concentrations of starch. The latter was controlled by dissolving known quantities of dry corn starch in the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The results revealed fewer clumps occurred at lower temperatures, regardless of starch concentration, with the team adding that the proteins did not start to clump below 65C. As temperatures increased, higher concentrations of starch were needed to avoid clumps forming and prevent the “mozzarella phase” – where huge wads of cheese appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“At higher starch concentrations, temperature becomes less of a concern, as the sauce remains smooth even with less precise heat control,” said Busiello.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Busiello added pasta water alone contains too little starch to reliably prevent clumping, only producing a smooth sauce with careful temperature control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Our recommended scientific approach uses a starch to cheese ratio between 2% and 3% by weight, allowing home cooks to reliably create a smooth sauce without worrying too much about temperature,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxNMTFOQWl6Q2x0TzE2cUkzejJaM2NKZ19JejZvMmFOWWpScG5haXRrc1JXUHJRSW45cmVXTWNvUkxneW4waFpLUkpkeGNLWG0zQ1J2MHJQZW1yVFh0dGtBUjF6Rk04VVhXUFJ6WVc2ZEJSZVJjTm1KYVhVUUhWVVlSY2hNWXZCeFJMNDZEZVliN0VWX3gtV3J4dGdLVjhFbk5XZEZsdnJDNVhzd1BMQTFkQWpGNmlrN2UzeXc</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，如果您患有糖尿病，保持水分的首选方法- EatingWell | The #1 Way to Stay Hydrated If You Have Diabetes, According to a Dietitian - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE9KVzdXTXcwMEduUThRbC1lcjVQNTROUUc0cXRLYmdFQ0JnRUhPRWtlekxJaW1FZ25NRVpObFZSY0xYSUVMMjl4Zm14V2ZnQkFncTBTcU5SVWlhSzR3TXhxQkVraVRoXzRseU1SaUFWWFk4T2NkTlkw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-blockquote" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Why is hydration so important for people with diabetes? Water makes up 60% to 75% of our bodies and plays an instrumental role in every single one of its functions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “If the body becomes dehydrated, blood sugar becomes more concentrated, leading to higher blood sugar levels and an increased strain on the body organs, like the kidneys, as they work to eliminate the excess glucose in urine,” says &lt;a href="http://erinpalinski.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Erin Palinski-Wade, RD, CDE&lt;/a&gt;, a New Jersey-based registered dietitian and certified diabetes educator and author of &lt;em&gt;2 Day Diabetes Diet.&lt;/em&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While staying hydrated supports healthy blood sugar levels, research shows it also improves overall metabolic health, potentially reducing the risk of weight gain, obesity and heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Hydration is also associated with improved cognition, energy levels and mood, which may make it easier to eat better and exercise.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If drinking more water feels like a constant struggle, there’s one habit that’s sure to help you stay hydrated: keeping a water bottle on hand. We spoke with a diabetes expert to find out why it’s so effective. Here’s what she told us. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-carrying-a-water-bottle-can-help-you-stay-hydrated"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Carrying a Water Bottle Can Help You Stay Hydrated  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Carrying a water bottle with you, whether you’re at home, running errands or working, keeps hydration top of mind and helps you stay ahead of thirst. “If you wait until you feel thirsty, you are already slightly dehydrated, which can lead to elevated blood sugar levels along with fatigue,” says Palinski-Wade. “Having a water bottle with you gives you a visual reminder to drink, which helps to make sure you are consistently taking in water all day long.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It also provides an easy way to gauge how much you’ve had to drink and how much more you need to hit your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8061842/how-much-water-do-you-need-when-you-have-diabetes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;daily water goals&lt;/a&gt;. Just like carrying a snack helps prevent dips in blood sugar and energy levels, having a water bottle on hand will help you avoid the effects of dehydration, including headaches, fatigue and high blood sugar. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, when you’ve got water nearby, you’re less likely to stop for a soda or sugar-sweetened drink. Not only do sugary drinks spike blood sugar, they may ironically contribute to dehydration. “If you consume an excessive amount of added sugar, this can draw water from your cells into the bloodstream, increasing urination and impairing fluid balance,” says Palinski-Wade. Even specialty hydration drinks can have added sugars. That doesn’t mean all hydration drinks are bad. Some are sugar-free. To find out for sure, check the Nutrition Facts panel on the label.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, you may be wondering how much fluid you need each day to stay hydrated. While the answer is different for everybody, a good goal is roughly 13 cups for men and 9 cups for women.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, your unique needs may differ depending on the temperature, if you exercise and your body weight, medications and health conditions. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-strategies-for-hydration"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Strategies for Hydration &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Make carrying a water bottle a habit you’ll stick with by choosing a bottle that sparks joy, is lightweight, comfortable to hold and won’t leak when tossed in a bag or the car. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These other strategies can also help improve your hydration game.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Track Your Water:&lt;/strong&gt; Whether you’re just starting your hydration journey or trying to stay consistent, logging your water intake can help you stay on track. “You can use apps such as MyFitnessPal to track your fluid intake or use your phone to set reminders to drink throughout the day,” says Palinski-Wade. Monitoring your water intake can also help you identify patterns when you’re more likely to forget to drink water. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Low-Sugar Flavor&lt;/strong&gt;: If plain water feels boring, try sprucing it up with fresh fruit and herbs, like this no-sugar-added &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/265887/lemon-cucumber-mint-infused-water/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lemon, Cucumber &amp;amp; Mint Infused Water&lt;/a&gt;. You can also alternate regular water with plain or flavored sparkling water. Or, try adding a sugar-free flavor packet to your H2O.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat Hydrating Foods&lt;/strong&gt;: Drinks aren’t the only way to hit your daily fluid goals. Foods provide 20% of our daily fluids, especially &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/17576/8-hydrating-foods-to-help-you-meet-your-water-goals/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;hydrating foods&lt;/a&gt; like fruits and veggies. “Try adding foods such as cucumber, watermelon, lettuce and celery to your plate to boost your water intake,” says Palinski-Wade. Not only do these foods give you fluids, they’re packed with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and fiber to support balanced blood sugar and overall health. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check Your Urine Color&lt;/strong&gt;: It may sound strange, but a quick and easy way to measure your hydration status is by simply checking the color of your pee. Light-colored urine is a sign of adequate hydration. The darker the urine becomes, the more likely it is that you need to drink up.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-spotlight--1-2-post mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight--1-2-post mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight mntl-block theme-1-2-post"&gt;&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight__heading_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight__heading mntl-text-block"&gt;Hydrating Dinner Recipes to Try&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hydration may not get as much attention as carbohydrates or exercise when it comes to managing diabetes. But it plays a key role in healthy blood sugar levels and can help you feel healthier and more energetic overall. That’s why staying ahead of your thirst by keeping a water bottle on hand is the No. 1 habit to support healthy hydration while managing diabetes. For the best results, pair this habit with other expert-approved strategies like tracking your water intake, drinking no-added-sugar beverages, eating hydrating foods and monitoring your urine color. So, what are you waiting for? It’s time to drink up!&lt;br&gt;

Researchers found high rates of bladder damage, painful organ cramps, low mood, and anxiety among those with ketamine use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the serious health impacts, nearly half of affected individuals had not sought treatment, and many reported poor experiences with healthcare providers. The findings call for better public awareness, improved clinical recognition, and more effective treatment programs for ketamine addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Severe Health Impacts:&lt;/strong&gt; 60% of ketamine users reported bladder or nasal problems, and over half experienced painful organ cramps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low Treatment Access:&lt;/strong&gt; Only 56% sought help, and only 36% of those were satisfied with their care.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awareness Gap:&lt;/strong&gt; Many users were unaware ketamine could cause addiction until it was too late, highlighting urgent public education needs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Exeter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ketamine addiction is linked to high levels of physical health problems and psychological consequences, with nearly half of those affected not seeking support or treatment, new research has revealed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by the University of Exeter and University College London (UCL), is the largest to date to explore the experience of people currently living with ketamine addiction in-depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supported by NIHR, the research included interviews with users, in which many said they were not aware of the risks of addiction until their ketamine use was already out of control, with one calling ketamine “the heroin of a generation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers studied 274 people who identified as having ketamine use disorder, and found previously under-reported symptoms. Of those, 60 per cent had experienced bladder or nasal problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that 56 per cent reported K-cramps – a painful organ cramping linked to excessive ketamine use, with which can often drive people back to the drug to seek relief from the pain of this symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bladder problems can involve needing a full bladder removal, and the need for a urostomy bag to collect urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychological symptoms included cravings, low mood, anxiety and irritability.  The research, published in &lt;em&gt;Addiction&lt;/em&gt;, found that only 56 per cent of participants sought treatment, and only 36 per cent of those were satisfied with their care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Professor Celia Morgan, of University of Exeter, said: “We know that ketamine use is on the rise, with a number of high-profile tragedies linked to ketamine addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Meanwhile, a growing number of clinical trials are finding therapeutic benefits involving ketamine in carefully-controlled environments, combined with therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research is the first to analyse in-depth the experience of people using very large amounts of ketamine, and shows the devastating physical health problems people can face with dependent ketamine use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study also highlights the barriers that people with ketamine addiction face when they try to seek treatment, often being sent away from treatment services.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uk government data indicates that ketamine use has more than doubled since 2016, with a threefold increase among 25-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate the impact on those who develop an addition to ketamine, the study involved both questionnaires and interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, 59 per cent of participants reported that there was “definitely not” enough awareness in education and among peer groups around the risks associated with ketamine, with many reporting that they did not know the drug could be addictive. Many reported feeling too embarrassed to seek treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In interviews, one participant said: “People know the risks about Heroin and Cocaine, but not how the addiction to Ketamine can become even stronger than being addicted to heroin or cocaine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While another told researchers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel it is the heroin of a generation, and more information will become available once more time passes and more people my age begin to suffer so greatly from misuse that it can’t be hidden anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants also painted a picture of a lack of understanding among health professionals. One said: All they did was give me painkillers and send me on my way”, while another reported “GP doesn’t think ketamine is addictive, just told me to stop, doesn’t have a clue”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-author Rebecca Harding, a PhD candidate at University College London, said: “Our study highlights the need for greater recognition of the significant physical and psychological risks associated with ketamine, both among healthcare professionals and the general public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need improved treatment programs, while raising awareness of ketamine use, to better support those seeking care. By focusing on evidence-based treatments, such as specialised group therapy and pharmacological interventions, we can improve access to effective treatment and address the growing challenge of ketamine use disorder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this addiction and mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d7a7a5b2a4a4b8b1b1beb4b297b2afb2a3b2a5f9b6b4f9a2bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Louise Vennells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://exeter.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Exeter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Louise Vennells – University of Exeter&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/add.70073" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The landscape of ketamine use disorder: patient experiences and perspectives on current treatment options&lt;/a&gt;” by Celia Morgan et al. &lt;em&gt;Addiction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The landscape of ketamine use disorder: patient experiences and perspectives on current treatment options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="add70073-sec-0001-title"&gt;Aims&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To report the symptoms and aetiology of ketamine use disorder (KUD), gauge the effectiveness of current treatment services and identify strategies to enhance patient access and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="add70073-sec-0002-title"&gt;Design&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mixed-methods, cross-sectional questionnaire.

The survey was open to international participants, with responses collected from the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Europe and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="add70073-sec-0004-title"&gt;Participants/Cases&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 274 individuals with self-identified KUD, including both treatment-seeking (40%) and non-treatment-seeking (60%) current or former ketamine users. Participants’ ages ranged from 18 to 67 years old, with 47.7% identifying as male. Additionally, 58.8% reported a diagnosed mental health disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, participants consumed 2.0 g of ketamine per day, with treatment-seeking individuals reporting higher average use (M = 2.67 g) than non-treatment-seeking users (M = 1.68 g) (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="add70073-sec-0005-title"&gt;Measurements&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed an online questionnaire addressing their attitudes toward ketamine and treatment services, including questions pertaining to their symptoms of problematic ketamine use, perceptions of education and awareness about KUD, opinions of existing treatment options, and facilitators for seeking treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="add70073-sec-0006-title"&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study identified various physical symptoms associated with KUD, with bladder problems (60%), nasal problems (60%) and ‘K-cramps’ (56%) being commonly reported among all users. In response to these symptoms, the majority (56%) did not seek treatment; among treatment-seeking users only 36% reported feeling satisfied with their care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of abstinence syndrome were also identified, including cravings (71%), low mood (62%), anxiety (59%) and irritability (45%). Treatment-seeking participants reported that the services they used had little (31%) or some (31%) awareness of ketamine, were not tailored to ketamine use (43%) and were generally only somewhat effective (43%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty-nine percent of participants reported that there was “definitely not” sufficient awareness in education and peer groups about the risks associated with ketamine use. When asked about the most important factors when choosing a treatment program, cost/affordability was the most cited for all participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="add70073-sec-0007-title"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ketamine use disorder (KUD) appears to be associated with a high prevalence of physical and psychological symptoms, including some specifically linked to abstinence. Despite this, most individuals with KUD do not seek treatment, and existing services are often perceived as ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 15:56:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE1NTWhFMG5ZcUlOeDV5X18wbGlPZFk4ZGsyQy1TQ3QtTzZjZXEzN3FzYVNyMUpnQmUwLTFzbFNBUDhJb2VQSFRGY3p4SUpOMEotc0dvbHR3LW5CQnJIam5uTUZhX3lXcF9vT1NWc0dpZmhzeDdvSUJN</guid></item><item><title>呃，在选择退出CT扫描之前，你应该三思而后行，因为你担心癌症。-石板 | Uh, You Should Think Twice Before Opting Out of a CT Scan Because You’re Worried About Cancer. - Slate</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxPN3lFRmZ0YWlrR25YazFtWFdMbW9lbWFoYnlIdVUydkJJWWx5d19PekllMldfRWstNm9yOGNiRzFLdG0xb1hoVUpuMEswNDVscmpTUjNGYU9Qbi0xbnR4NWhHNUgtY2tLWnlwS2JrMVR0WGdqeU5TWVlKNVNhZHRnelFWVEphUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrave0083cwm4bsu4i0ln@published"&gt;When you get an X-ray, it can be a bit unnerving: The radiology technician puts on a lead gown or ducks behind a barrier before running the scan. Which might make you wonder: If the radiation is so bad that they need protective equipment, why are &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; getting exposed to it?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="58" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rreow000o3b73eibfswbb@published"&gt;There is a simple answer. You are getting only one dose of radiation from your scan, but the tech might be doing a couple dozen of those same scans a day. Radiation doses add up, so people who regularly work with the machines need protection so that they can lower their risk of getting cancer from their job.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rreqk000p3b73fxb5cyhr@published"&gt;But a new study questions whether scans—specifically &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ct-scan/about/pac-20393675#:~:text=Your%20healthcare%20professional%20may%20suggest,infection%20or%20blood%20clot%20is."&gt;computed tomography scans&lt;/a&gt;—are causing more cancer than we thought, specifically among the patients who receive them.

Other CTs are used to identify and treat cancer, rule out serious neurological problems, and more. &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14610965/cancer-CT-scans-study-children.html"&gt;According&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ct-scans-projected-to-result-in-100000-new-cancers-in-the-us"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/ct-scan-cancer-risk-11719982"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/16/g-s1-60488/ct-scan-cancer-risk-ionizing-radiation"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/could-ct-scans-be-fuelling-a-future-rise-in-cancer-cases-as-a-new-study-suggests-254633"&gt;stories&lt;/a&gt;, CT scans could be &lt;em&gt;causing&lt;/em&gt; a remarkably high number of cancers each year and could eventually be responsible for 1 in 20 cancers in the United States. Yikes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="39" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rreu7000q3b7317m4bvst@published"&gt;There are, however, some major issues with the media reports. Although CT scans can and sometimes do cause cancer in patients, the reality is that you probably aren’t in much danger when you go in for a recommended scan.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrew1000r3b73riza114s@published"&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832778"&gt;The study itself&lt;/a&gt; is basically a modeling exercise. The authors took an estimate of the number of CT scans done every year in the U.S., based on research from 2023. Next, they estimated the dose of radiation that each CT would give the patient, based on the body part that was exposed in the scan and evidence from studies of radiation dosage. Finally, they used an online calculator, called RadRAT, to estimate the number of cancers that the estimated radiation dosage would cause over the lifetimes of all the people getting the scans.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrey1000s3b739qi89lj3@published"&gt;The authors found that in 2023 there were 93 million CTs done on 62 million patients. The total estimated lifetime number of cancers caused by the radiation from these CTs in their model came out to about 100,000. So, for the 62 million people who got CTs over the course of 2023, there would eventually be an additional 100,000 cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="116" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrezv000t3b73yrh12cwt@published"&gt;This sounds like a big number, but is it, really, compared with the overall amount of cancer in the population? If you ask the authors, they say that the cancer from CT scans could &lt;em&gt;eventually&lt;/em&gt; add up to 5 percent of all cancers diagnosed in the United States. That seems pretty significant! But this is assuming that the number of yearly cancers stays the same between now and 2075 (about the time the kids included in the study would be developing cancer from the CT scans they received in 2023). That’s very unlikely—the total number of cancers annually will probably &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; by then due to population growth alone. In any case, it’s a figure based on an iffy assumption.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrf1f000u3b731cw7jnyb@published"&gt;I think a better way to look at this is by considering that about 40 percent of people will get cancer in their lifetime. If 62 million people are getting CTs, we’d estimate that 25 million of them would get cancer without the additional CT risk. The extra cancers from the CTs therefore account for an additional 0.4 percent, or one extra lifetime cancer per 250 people.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="150" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrf33000v3b733zlg898e@published"&gt;In context, that number is not scary at all. The authors of the study compare CT scans with alcohol consumption, which is another risk factor for cancer. But people rarely get CT scans for the fun of it. One of the most common reasons for having a CT in the first place is because you either probably or definitely have cancer already, and the imaging can help doctors know exactly what they’re dealing with so they can do their best to get rid of it. Most people are likely fine with accepting a 1-in-250 risk of getting an additional cancer if it means that their current cancer can be treated appropriately rather than having a surgeon simply guess where the tumor is located. No serious medical treatment is risk-free; we get treatment anyway because the downsides of &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; doing anything are worse. In this case, they can be &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; worse.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrf4q000w3b733essq6i1@published"&gt;The other issue with the estimate of 100,000 cancers is that it’s almost certainly too high. RadRAT, the calculator that the researchers used, is designed to estimate the lifetime risk of cancer for people who &lt;a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/22810503"&gt;are generally healthy&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, when calculating lifetime risk, the tool assumes that people who are exposed to radiation are going to live as long as the average person of that age and sex who was alive in the U.S. in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrf6f000x3b735ojrikzw@published"&gt;But we know that CTs are not generally given to otherwise healthy people. If you’re not in great shape to start, you’re less likely to live as long as the average person, and you have less time to develop cancer in the first place. It’s quite likely that the lifetime number of cancers is dramatically overestimated by the published paper.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrf82000y3b73d1dcufzp@published"&gt;There is a useful bit of truth in the lesson news stories are taking from the paper: You shouldn’t get a CT scan unless you actually need one. We do have a problem with doing too many CT scans. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0363018820302048?casa_token=AfuUGbksmKsAAAAA:qZp3p8PkAo5Rz85VSYJvNHIh-8kdiNKfvHcgGoc_o2Bchl_6rqGYterhy72ahf8_4auWs82bNg"&gt;Studies looking at&lt;/a&gt; whether CT scans were appropriately ordered suggest that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009926019305483?casa_token=jxHFl11ruDYAAAAA:2uPHWrYbFRKabpaT8M5gveiQunC62Oye7WbS0aR-l6qUvWfc-6F-LxbvG8-dC8PiSAg_5lPGkQ"&gt;somewhere between&lt;/a&gt; 8 and 36 percent of them are not needed. Given that these scans definitely do cause cancer—albeit quite rarely—we should instead be trying to ensure that we perform them only when absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="61" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrfa1000z3b73gs21j47l@published"&gt;That being said, the idea that 1 in 20 cancers is—or will be—&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJABhXDyX5t/?hl=en"&gt;caused by CTs&lt;/a&gt; is very unlikely to be true. The actual figure is presumably quite a bit lower. And while we should be careful to use those high-radiation scans only when necessary, in most cases if a doctor tells you to get a CT, you should probably do &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terlizzi and his fellow author are all living abroad and frequently meet for dinner. Cacio e pepe is among their favorite traditional dishes to make, and as physicists, they couldn't help but want to learn more about the unique physics of the process, not to mention "the more practical aim to avoid wasting good pecorino," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1081682?"&gt;said Terlizzi&lt;/a&gt;. They focused on the separation that often occurs when cheese and water are mixed, building on earlier &lt;a href="https://bressanini-lescienze.blogautore.espresso.repubblica.it/2013/05/13/le-ricette-scientifiche-la-cacio-e-pepe/"&gt;culinary experiments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the pasta cooks in boiling water, the noodles release starch. Traditionally, the chef will extract part of the water and starch solution—which is cooled to a suitable temperature to avoid clumping as the cheese proteins "denaturate"—and mix it with the cheese to make the sauce, adding the pepper last, right before serving. But the authors note that temperature is not the only factor that can lead to this dreaded “mozzarella phase."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, if one tries to mix cheese and water without any starch, the clumping is more pronounced. There is less clumping with water containing a little starch, like water in which pasta has been cooked. And when one mixes the cheese with pasta water "risottata"—i.e., collected and heated in a pan so enough water evaporates that there is a higher concentration of starch—there is almost no clumping.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So starch plays a crucial role in the process of making cacio e pepe. The authors devised a set of experiments to scientifically investigate the phase behavior of water, starch, and cheese mixed together in various concentrations and at different temperatures. They primarily used standard kitchen tools to make sure home cooks could recreate their results (although not every kitchen has a sous vide machine). This enabled them to devise a phase diagram of what happens to the sauce as the conditions change.&lt;/p&gt;

I went to a clinic a few times and they pretty much said it was a sinus infection.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a month later, she decided to visit the doctor's office on her campus after finding herself too weak to walk up a flight of stairs or even go to classes - where she underwent a blood test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Realizing that Hunter was severely anemic - where the body lacks enough healthy red blood cells - doctors at the clinic urged her to go to an emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She then tried going to an ER close to her campus but since they were full, Hunter decided to visit The University of Texas Medical Branch Hospital in her hometown League City, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After multiple blood tests, Hunter and her family were finally told that she was suffering from &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14579047/Woman-33-given-months-live-long-Covid-turned-deadly-cancer.html"&gt;high risk acute myeloid leukemia&lt;/a&gt;, an aggressive blood cancer and was admitted to MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Breeze Hunter, 22, a student at Texas A&amp;amp;M University has revealed how a headache and pressure in her nose led her to discover she was suffering from an acute form of blood cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/college-student-sinus-infection-symptoms-leukemia-rcna203303"&gt;TODAY.com&lt;/a&gt;: 'I told them that the headaches are still here. I'm very weak and had fatigue. They recommended doing a blood test.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had many people coming in and saying, 'It's looking like a sign of leukemia, but we'll keep testing because it could be a bunch of other things'.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I freaked out. I had no idea what leukemia was. I was like am I going to survive this? Or is it treatable?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Acute myeloid leukemia affects the myeloid cells in the bone marrow which are responsible for maturing into red and white blood cells in the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once turned cancerous, these cells &lt;span&gt;move from the bone marrow into the blood and spread the disease to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes, liver, spleen, brain and spinal cord. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When it affects the brain and spinal cord, it can cause symptoms like headaches and weakness in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike other cancers, there are no numbered stages of AML and it can progress in rapid speeds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some symptoms of AML include fatigue, feeling cold, dizziness, pale skin, shortness of breath, easy bruising and bleeding with no clear cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The exact causes are unclear, however, smoking, being overweight, radiation exposure and previous chemotherapy can increase risks of developing AML. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But many patients, like Breeze Hunter, don't fall into any of those categories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2024, over 20,00 Americans were diagnosed with AML and about 11,200 people died from the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After multiple blood tests, Hunter and her family were told that she was suffering from high risk acute myeloid leukemia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Possible treatments often include chemotherapy, targeted therapy and at times stem cell transplantation (a medical procedure that replaces diseased or damaged blood-forming stem cells with healthy ones from a donor). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within days of being diagnosed, Hunter underwent a bone marrow aspiration (a sample of the liquid part of bone marrow taken for testing) and a spinal tap (a sample of cerebrospinal fluid taken from the lower part of the spine).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctors at the MD Anderson Cancer Center also kept her in the hospital and placed her seven days of chemotherapy infusions along with an experimental cancer-fighting pill, which was part of a clinical trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Much to their surprise, doctors tested Hunter's bone marrow after 21 days of starting chemotherapy to see if the treatment worked and saw improvement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was then placed on a second seven-day round of the treatment and showed significant improvement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was supposed to get at least six rounds,' Hunter said. 'The chemo worked so well I only had to do two.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to her now-viral TikTok page, the college student was on a six-month chemotherapy plan that ended earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After undergoing 11 rounds of radiation to kill any possible lingering cancer cells in her brain and spine plus an new intense round of chemotherapy, she received a stem cell transplant from her 21-year-old brother, Roy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After undergoing 11 rounds of radiation to kill any possible lingering cancer cells in her brain and spine plus an new intense round of chemotherapy, she received a stem cell transplant from her 21-year-old brother, Roy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A stem cell transplant, also known as a bone marrow transplant, replaces damaged or diseased bone marrow with healthy stem cells that can develop into different types of blood cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is done to treat various conditions, including certain cancers, blood disorders, and autoimmune diseases.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I got a radiation/chemo burn all over my body, which was very very painful and I was pretty much burnt all over,' she said. The chemotherapy regimen 'was harder than the leukemia one.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following the transplant, she has remained in the hospital for to make sure everything went well and protect her from potential infection from her weakened immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Probably towards the end I was over it. I was like, 'I can't do this. This is too much,' Hunter recalled. 'It was very hard at times but God's watching me. So, I knew I was going to be OK.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since the end of her intense treatment, Hunter is now in remission and claims to feel better as well as stronger and intends to walk in her college graduation soon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Continuous glucose meters (CGMs) aren’t just widgets for the wellness crowd. For many, CGMs are real-time feedback machines for the body, offering glucose trendlines that help people rethink how they eat. They allow diabetics to continue their daily life without stabbing their fingertips several times a day, in the most inconvenient places. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZTcJdSd2Rk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;This video by [Becky Stern]&lt;/a&gt; is all about comparing two of the most popular continuous glucose monitors (CGMs): the Abbott Libre 3 and the Dexcom G7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the Libre 3 and the G7 come with spring-loaded applicators and stick to the upper arm. At first glance they seem similar, but the differences run deep. The Libre 3 is the minimalist of both: two plastic discs sandwiching the electronics. The G7, in contrast, features an over-molded shell that suggests a higher production cost, and perhaps, greater robustness. The G7 needs a button push to engage, which users describe as slightly clumsy compared to the Libre’s simpler poke-and-go design. The nuance: G7’s ten-day lifespan means more waste than the fourteen-day Libre, yet the former allows for longer submersion in water, if that’s your passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these devices are primarily intended for people with diabetes, they’ve quietly been adopted by a growing tribe of biohackers and curious minds who are eager to explore their own metabolic quirks. In February, we featured &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2025/02/23/over-the-counter-glucose-monitor-dissected/"&gt;a dissection of the Stelo CGM&lt;/a&gt;, cracking open its secrets layer by layer.&lt;/p&gt;

Using computational models, behavioral tasks, and clinical data from Parkinson’s patients, researchers found that stopping and switching are distinct cognitive motor processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This insight could improve treatments for neurological disorders like Parkinson’s and inspire biologically driven designs for autonomous systems. The findings highlight the complexity and precision of how the human brain adapts rapidly to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switching vs. Stopping:&lt;/strong&gt; Switching actions is a separate process from stopping, actively suppressing previous movements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parkinson’s Insights:&lt;/strong&gt; Studying Parkinson’s patients during deep brain stimulation reveals key brain activity related to switching.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Applications:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding action regulation could improve therapies and inspire new robotics technologies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;USC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New USC research offers an unseen insight into how the brain shifts gears. The researchers discovered that our innate ability to make quick changes in motor function are the result of a unique brain mechanism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the high-stakes world of the NBA, we watch in awe as our favorite player seamlessly switches moves in the blink of an eye.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans have a remarkable ability to rapidly switch between different motor actions when life throws us a curveball. You reach to pull open a door but suddenly see you must push to exit. In traffic, you must think fast to change from accelerating to evading or braking to avoid an obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain function that helps us switch course has been the subject of extensive scientific debate, with the key question being whether the function the brain uses to help us switch gears is the same one it uses to stop our movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from USC’s Alfred E. Mann Department of Biomedical Engineering has harnessed a complex mathematical model to reveal that this switch is not an extension of stopping but a unique action that actively suppresses the previous one, enabling a seamless transition to the new target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team has also been observing Parkinson’s patients playing simple video gaming tasks in order to study the mechanism in action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt;, shedding new light on how our brains select, stop, and switch between actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Vasileios Christopoulos, an assistant professor of biomedical engineering, said that while switching course may seem like an innate process for humans, the complexity of how this is triggered in the brain has been a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Traditionally, psychologists believe that switching is an extension of stopping. It’s what we call ‘go, stop, go.’ You go. You stop and you switch to the new action,” Christopoulos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, we believe that — especially when you have to perform something really fast — your brain doesn’t do that. Instead, the new action suppresses your current action without using another mechanism to inhibit it. Stopping and switching are two different cognitive motor processes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopoulos said the function was fundamental to understand from a scientific perspective, given that humans switch and regulate their actions at every moment of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a clinical perspective, if we understand how the brain regulates actions, and if we understand how Parkinson’s affects these mechanisms, we can create better clinical treatments for patients,” Christopoulos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s also the engineering perspective. If we can create a model of the brain that generates actions, then we can create biologically-inspired robotic systems, like autonomous cars, based on the way that the brain actually regulates these actions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To validate their hypothesis on how the brain switches actions, the research team used a three-pronged approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, they built a computational model of the brain, which aimed to simulate how the brain decides which action to perform, how it inhibits an ongoing action, and how it initiates a new action when the context changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then used human participants to perform tasks involving reaching, stopping and switching movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team compared the participants’ motor behavior to the simulated motor patterns generated by the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the team has been working with Parkinson’s patients at Cedars Sinai and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center to see the mechanism in action through patients’ recorded brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopoulos’ co-author on the paper is the chair of Neurosurgery department at UT Southwestern Medical Center, Nader Pouratian. Shan Zhong, a postdoctoral researcher in the Alfred E. Mann Department, developed the computational models and acquired and analyzed the behavioral data for the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new insight into one of the foundational aspects of human motor control could be an essential development for the 90,000 Americans diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s patients deal with longer reaction times and delays when they want to initiate movement, compared with those of us who don’t live with complex neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This group of patients was of interest to the USC Viterbi research team because their treatment involves deep brain stimulation of the subcortical regions that control motor function — a prime opportunity to record brain activity to better understand the complex processes of motor regulation in this region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopoulos said that when the patients in the test groups undergo the deep brain stimulation procedure, the surgeon accesses this region via a burr hole, inserting a long electrode that simultaneously allows brain activity to be monitored while they are awake during treatment. The procedure aims to treat Parkinson’s-related tremors by stimulating the subthalamic nucleus or STN region, which Christopoulos described as the brain’s natural braking system, a crucial component of the switching-gears mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is how our brain stops our actions. For instance, we’ve all experienced that sensation when you freeze because you’re scared or surprised,” Christopoulos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What happens to this area of the brain where you get scared is that it sends a signal to the brain to immediately stop whatever you’re doing. For Parkinson’s patients, this area is hyperactive and creates a tremor and bradykinesia (slowed movement).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The patients are awake and given a joystick. We show them the screen, and we show them tasks that involve reaching for targets, stopping an action and switching an action from one target to the other,” Christopoulos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, the next step is to take this data from the neurosurgeons and analyze it. We’re going to see how similar the predictions of our simulated model are to what actually happens in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopoulos said that the work had additional clinical value. Monitoring how Parkinson’s patients perform while under deep brain stimulation and how the treatment affects the brain could help clinicians avoid undue side effects and improve treatments for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By harnessing their computational model supported by carefully designed experiments, Christopoulos and his team are continuing to unravel the intricate neural mechanisms that underpin our most essential cognitive functions, paving the way for new discoveries and applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was supported by an NIH U01 award titled “Modeling and Mapping Human Action Regulation Networks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#197874607b756c747c596c6a7a377c7d6c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Amy Blumenthal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://usc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;USC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Amy Blumenthal – USC&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Computational mechanism underlying switching of motor actions&lt;/a&gt;” by Vasileios Christopoulos et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computational mechanism underlying switching of motor actions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Survival of species in an ever-changing environment requires a flexibility that extends beyond merely selecting the most appropriate actions. It also involves readiness to stop or switch actions in response to environmental changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although considerable research has been devoted to understanding how the brain switches actions, the computations underlying the switching process and how it relates to the selecting and stopping processes remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A normative theory suggests that switching is simply an extension of the stopping process, during which a current action is first inhibited by an independent pause mechanism before a new action is generated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This theory was challenged by the affordance competition hypothesis, according to which the switching process is implemented through a competition between the current and new actions, without engaging an independent pause mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To delineate the computations underlying these action regulation functions, we utilized a neurocomputational theory that models the process of selecting, stopping and switching reaching movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tested the model predictions in healthy individuals who performed reaches in dynamic and uncertain environments that often required stopping and switching actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that unlike the stopping process, switching does not necessitate a proactive pause mechanism to delay movement initiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, the switching and stopping processes seem to be implemented by different mechanisms at the planning phase of the reaching movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, once the reaching movement has been initiated, the switching process seems to involve an independent pause mechanism if the new target location is unknown prior to movement initiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings offer a new understanding of the computations underlying action switching, contribute valuable insights into the fundamental neuroscientific mechanisms of action regulation, and open new avenues for future neurophysiological investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

Science University in US analysed data from just over 1,500 women aged between 18 and 45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Getting a flu jab can disrupt women's menstrual cycles and this happens regardless of if you have a Covid vaccine, scientists say&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of these, 791 only had the flu vaccine, while 710 had flu and Covid jabs at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On average, women who had the flu jab saw their menstrual cycle length increase by half a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in 20 women in both groups experienced a change in cycle at least eight days after vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The alteration in menstrual cycle only occurred if women were vaccinated in the first half of their cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found the increase only occurred if women were vaccinated during the follicular phase of their cycle - when an egg matures to be released during ovulation - which begins the day a woman gets her period and can last for 13 to 14 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Much like previous studies on the topic, these changes were found to be temporary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-8ceb7560-2509-11f0-a04e-2140c716dce2" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14660141/flu-vaccine-effect-womens-health.html"&gt;

Higher-intensity physical activity was linked to better processing speed, working memory, and executive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, lower activity levels were associated with declines in cognitive performance. These findings highlight the power of even minor lifestyle changes to protect and enhance brain health as people age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Boost:&lt;/strong&gt; Moderate-to-vigorous exercise improves processing speed, working memory, and executive function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small Steps Matter:&lt;/strong&gt; Even adding just five minutes of higher-intensity exercise shows cognitive benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Activity Prioritization:&lt;/strong&gt; How time is spent across the day can directly influence brain health outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of South Australia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brisk walk, a splash of water aerobics, or even a light jog around the block – if your heart rate goes up then so too will your brain health according to new research from the University of South Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducted in partnership with the US-based AdventHealth Research Institute, the new study found that staying active through moderate-to-vigorous physical activity is associated with significantly better processing speed, working memory, and executive function in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the biggest cognitive gains were seen among people who went from doing no moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, to even doing just five minutes, clearly illustrating the power of exercise for the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assessing data from 585 older adults (aged 65-80 years) in the USA-based IGNITE trial*, the study examined associations between time spent in sleep, sedentary behaviour, light physical activity, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity across the 24-hr day, and cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers identified a two-way relationship between ‘huff-and-puff’ physical activity and brain health: do more exercise and your brain health improves; but do less and it declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UniSA researcher, Dr Maddison Mellow says the study highlights how small changes to your daily activities can have big impacts on your brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are three mutually exclusive lifestyle behaviours in the 24-hour day – sleep, sedentary behaviour and physical activity – and how these interact to influence our health outcomes,” Dr Mellow says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, we know that being more active can improve our sleep; or having a better night’s sleep could boost our energy levels to perform physical activity the next day. But what we don’t know is the optimal balance of time spent in each of these behaviours to maximise cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this study we explored how different uses of time impact your brain. We found that higher levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity – that is, activity performed at higher intensities that increases your heart rate and breathing – was related to better cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Specifically, ‘huff-and-puff’ physical activity (like aerobic exercise) improves processing speed (how fast your brain thinks), executive function (how well you plan, focus, and multitask) and working memory (your ability to store information for short periods of time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Importantly, the opposite was also true: lower levels of this higher intensity physical activity were related to poorer performance on these tests.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were consistent across different genetic and demographic backgrounds. Interestingly, the findings did not extend to episodic memory (the what, where and when details of an event) or visuospatial function outcomes (your ability to recognise places and navigate through spaces).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-researcher, Dr Audrey Collins, says understanding the interplay between different activities could empower older people to make positive health changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are only 24 hours in a day, so every day, we make decisions about how we spend our time. For example, if we sleep for eight hours, then there’s 16 hours remaining for waking behaviours like physical activity or sedentary behaviour; that’s the basic reality,” Dr Collins says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results show that how we choose to spend our time across the 24-hour day may be differentially related to our brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding that we need to prioritise physical activity – such as physical activity that gets our heart rates up, according to our findings – is the key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With one in six people in the world expected to be 60 years or older by 2030, we need to make sure we are supporting and empowering people to age well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this instance, we hope that knowledge is power: boost your physical activity and boost your brain health to stay fit and well as you age. However, these results are cross-sectional and need to be tested longitudinally and experimentally.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The IGNITE study was conducted at the University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, PA), University of Kansas Medical Center (Kansas City, KS), and Northeastern University (Boston, MA) and involved a large, well-characterised sample of cognitively unimpaired older adults. Participants were, on average, 69.8 years of age, predominantly female (70%), and self-reported as inactive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this aging and exercise research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a5e4cbcbc4c7c0c98be8c4cbd6c3ccc0c9c1e5d0cbccd6c48bc0c1d08bc4d0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Annabel Mansfield&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://unisa.edu.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of South Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Annabel Mansfield – University of South Australia&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afaf072" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;24-Hour time use and cognitive performance in late adulthood: results from the Investigating Gains in Neurocognition in an Intervention Trial of Exercise (IGNITE) study&lt;/a&gt;” by Maddison Mellow et al. &lt;em&gt;Age and Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24-Hour time use and cognitive performance in late adulthood: results from the Investigating Gains in Neurocognition in an Intervention Trial of Exercise (IGNITE) study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This cross-sectional study examined associations between 24-hour time-use composition (i.e. sleep, sedentary time, light physical activity and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity) and cognitive performance and explored whether demographic or genetic factors moderated these relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This analysis included baseline data from cognitively unimpaired older adults (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 648) enrolled in the Investigating Gains in Neurocognition in an Intervention Trial of Exercise study. Time use was measured using wrist-worn triaxial accelerometers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive domains were determined using a confirmatory factor analysis from a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Linear regression models tested associations between time-use composition and cognitive factors, adjusting for age, sex, education, body mass index, apolipoprotein E4 (&lt;em&gt;APOE4&lt;/em&gt;) allele carriage and study site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interaction terms evaluated moderation of time use by age, sex, education and &lt;em&gt;APOE4&lt;/em&gt; status. We also examined the theoretical impact of reallocating time between time-use behaviours on cognitive performance using compositional isotemporal substitution methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time-use composition was associated with processing speed (&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; = 5.16, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .002), working memory (&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; = 4.81, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .003) and executive function/attentional control (&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; = 7.09, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001) but not episodic memory (&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; = 2.28, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .078) or visuospatial function (&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; = 2.26, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .081). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Post hoc&lt;/em&gt; isotemporal substitution analyses found that significant associations were driven by time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), with lesser amounts of MVPA associated with poorer cognitive performance. There was no evidence of moderation by any tested factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasing or decreasing MVPA, at the expense of time spent in sleep, sedentary behaviour or light physical activity, may be related to individual variation in processing speed, executive function/attentional control and working memory in older adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 14:59:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE5oaS03djRObHo1U09RMU5pQ1J2UV9wTUpUTHRoZm1JVTNra3Z1ZjcyUktsUzhfLWdTaWhWVnJYd1BhTUcxdDU0ZWx2MWhNVG8wYXNPTlVOV1lWVkh3R1BtMG4tRlFsV1JUR3NheDhwOA</guid></item><item><title>新研究显示，为什么美国各地的预期寿命差异很大，尤其是女性的预期寿命- NBC新闻 | Why life expectancy varies widely across the U.S. especially for women, new study reveals - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxOWnBWSkdsUmVDcjRwUm53YnUtT21zTXB0ZHNrbWdxdnN6TEI4UUx1b3AtcDEwZUpJTFNnQjZ5T0ZoUUJEZGw4US0yWTJXbkg0dVFBdGFFOXRHS25NNkExYWdseWY1SjJaamxkQjJ5bHpYc3NHVVViYzJ3M2JaU2RzdUFnWW00NW5Jd1pweXdSbk4zT0I2VTd2aVBPd9IBVkFVX3lxTE5OMDBtNVprZkxuSTg2U3NJc2NXMG80R05VVUF3dkxFV3VZT21EMUR3Wk1lVVpiRzYxQ1FlajFleHBzVGtOX0wwLTJZcV92MDZHOFJTdkpR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;How long you live depends on where you live, new research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/us-life-expectancy-increase-rcna184502" target="_blank"&gt;Americans’ life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; increased throughout the 20th century, although in some states, particularly in the South, people aren’t living much longer than they were 100 years ago. It’s worse among women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Researchers at the Yale School of Public Health analyzed the death data of 77 million women and 102 million men born from 1900 through 2000. The findings, published Monday in the journal &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2833159" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;, showed that nationwide life expectancy for women increased from 73.8 to 84.1 in that time frame, while it jumped from 62.8 to 80.3 for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Scientists and health officials calculate life expectancy at birth as a way of understanding a country’s health over time. How long people in the United States lived since the last century varied drastically by state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“What was surprising to me was that for some states, especially for women, there’s basically no change,” said study co-author Theodore Holford, a senior research scientist in biostatistics at Yale University. “Over 100 years, in some of these Southern states, they improved less than two years in the framework of all of the medical advances that we have seen during the 20th century.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The bottom five states for life expectancy among women born in 2000, compared to women born in 1900, are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;West Virginia, 75.3, up from 74.3.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oklahoma, 76, down from 76.7.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kentucky, 76.5, up from 74.9.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mississippi, 76.6, up from 73.2.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arkansas, 76.6, up from 75.7.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Southern men born in 2000 also tended to have lower life expectancies, though they showed greater improvements than women since 1900:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mississippi, 71.8, up from 62.3.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;West Virginia, 72.6, up from 63.7.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alabama, 72.6, up from 62.5.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Louisiana, 72.9, up from 61.5.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tennessee 73.4, up from 63.6.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Not all &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus/sources-definitions/geographic-region.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Southern states&lt;/a&gt; show lower or stalled life expectancies for people born in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Florida, Texas and Virginia are among the Southern states featured in the top 20 of life expectancy for both men and women born in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;States outside the South that ranked in the bottom 10 for both sexes include Ohio and Indiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The study also highlights life expectancy by state and sex at the midway point of 1950.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Men in particular showed greater improvement during the first half of the century. In North Dakota, for example, male life expectancy jumped 10 years from 66.4 in 1900 to 76.5 in 1950, but only one year, 77.8, from 1950 to 2000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Data reflects the state in which a person died, not where they were born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It’s well-established that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7829786/" target="_blank"&gt;women live longer than men&lt;/a&gt;, but this latest research unveils geographic disparities in life expectancy at a turning point in federal public health administration.

And &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/not-even-wealth-saving-americans-dying-rates-seen-poorest-europeans-rcna198929" target="_blank"&gt;life expectancy is declining&lt;/a&gt; for many groups of Americans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Why is life expectancy lower in the South?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The Yale study claims to be the first to analyze historic state mortality trends by birth cohort, meaning entire generations are tracked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Population health research more commonly involves a metric called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7026938/" target="_blank"&gt;period life expectancy&lt;/a&gt;, which estimates influences on mortality over a select year, such as &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/5-years-later-long-covid-still-medical-mystery-scientists-learned-rcna195608" target="_blank"&gt;during a pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The idea here is to try to pick up on generational factors,” Holford said. “There are lots of factors related to health that are more closely tied to generations than a calendar year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Cindy Prins, an associate professor in the department of population health sciences at the University of Central Florida College of Medicine, who wasn’t involved in the study, said, “This is a unique and important approach to examining life expectancies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;That doesn’t make the data any less alarming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s concerning to know that cohort life expectancies in many Southern states, which have the lowest overall life expectancies, haven’t changed much over time,” Prins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Overall, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2466136" target="_blank"&gt;Americans are living longer&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to improvements in &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/obamacare-supreme-court-preventative-care-challenge-rcna201794" target="_blank"&gt;health care&lt;/a&gt;, sanitation, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hhs-cut-quit-smoking-programs-tips-cdc-fda-rcna199251" target="_blank"&gt;tobacco control&lt;/a&gt;, and the prevention of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/cancer-patients-immunotherapy-may-way-skip-surgery-chemo-rcna203038" target="_blank"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/heart-health/heart-disease-deaths-soar-rural-america-driven-rise-working-age-adults-rcna184750" target="_blank"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/track-measles-outbreak-cases-us-map-rcna198932" target="_blank"&gt;other diseases&lt;/a&gt;, the study said. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32748998/" target="_blank"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; indicates that states with progressive public health policies are more likely to have higher life expectancies. Socioeconomic differences among states also impact longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Marc Gourevitch, a professor in the department of population health at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine, said research shows that states with policies that support a more livable minimum wage and paid sick leave, as well as access to affordable medical care, are more likely to show significant life expectancy gains over time.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Focusing on policies that help people better meet their everyday needs promises to go a long way in improving life expectancy and, with it, giving more people a chance at getting to watch their grandchildren grow,” said Gourevitch, who wasn’t involved in the Yale study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Women born in 2000 in the District of Columbia have both the highest life expectancy, 93 years, and the biggest improvement since 1900, when life expectancy was 63.9. Similarly, D.C. men born in 2000 have the third-highest life expectancy of 86.5 years, up from 48.7 at the start of the century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Urban areas tend to do a lot better than rural areas, presumably because of differences in access to health care,” Holford said of people living longer in the nation’s capital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Another change is the mix of the population in the District of Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Many more people moving into the area who would have a lot of the monetary advantages that would give them better access to things affecting their health,” Holford said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Which states have the highest life expectancy?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;States with the longest life expectancies for women born in 2000 spanned both coasts and beyond the continental U.S.:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;New York, 91.9, up from 71.2. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;California, 91.3, up from 73.6. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Massachusetts, 88.8, up from 74.2. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hawaii, 88.7, up from 75.6.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Other than D.C., these states show the longest life expectancy among men born in 2000:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;New York, 87.8, up from 60.1. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;California, 86.8, up from 62.7.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Massachusetts, 84.8, up from 63.4.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Washington, 84.3, up from 63.7. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Holford said the Yale study is part of his work with the National Cancer Institute’s &lt;a href="https://cisnet.cancer.gov" target="_blank"&gt;Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET)&lt;/a&gt;. A goal of this and other CISNET research is to help health departments address state-specific disparities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;One downside to implementing promising public health policies, Holford said, is that it can take years  — even generations — to measure their effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Nevertheless, it’s important to start it so that you put these things in place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 14:52:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxOWnBWSkdsUmVDcjRwUm53YnUtT21zTXB0ZHNrbWdxdnN6TEI4UUx1b3AtcDEwZUpJTFNnQjZ5T0ZoUUJEZGw4US0yWTJXbkg0dVFBdGFFOXRHS25NNkExYWdseWY1SjJaamxkQjJ5bHpYc3NHVVViYzJ3M2JaU2RzdUFnWW00NW5Jd1pweXdSbk4zT0I2VTd2aVBPd9IBVkFVX3lxTE5OMDBtNVprZkxuSTg2U3NJc2NXMG80R05VVUF3dkxFV3VZT21EMUR3Wk1lVVpiRzYxQ1FlajFleHBzVGtOX0wwLTJZcV92MDZHOFJTdkpR</guid></item><item><title>我的丈夫想向他的家人隐瞒我们的怀孕。我不可能接受这个。-石板 | My Husband Wants to Hide Our Pregnancy From His Family.

He’s the one who catches and releases spiders. He jumps out of the car to help strangers. My issue here is with his family, my in-laws. For lack of a better term, they do not “adult.” They are currently living in the second house that has literally rotted down around them due to lack of upkeep. There is a tremendous amount of unchecked mental and physical illness; while they’re kind and loving, they are also unable to hold jobs. They start food fights in restaurants because it doesn’t occur to them that their behavior is ridiculous. There is hoarding on a few levels, depression, you name it. My husband didn’t feel like he had a real home until we moved in together and he noticed that we suddenly lived like functioning adults, because he had never experienced it.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma2lgbpn001h3b73n88yfa9y@published"&gt;We are currently expecting our second baby. My husband does not want to share the news with his parents about our pregnancy for fear they will come visit. (Thankfully, we live far away from them.) He thinks about their situation and he cries. His frustration with seeing his family deteriorate, yet do nothing to get help or move forward, is very hard to watch. They have refused help every time we’ve offered, from helping put a new roof on their house or clean out the mess that the collapsed roof made. All to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma2lgbpn001i3b73rvlxo6on@published"&gt;Their life choices have given us so much anxiety over the last few years that I am not sure how to support him. Yes, I do hold them in contempt for a multitude of reasons, but they do deserve to know they will have another grandchild. They adore our child (even though we have strict boundaries when they do visit) and would be thrilled at this news. And we can’t hide it indefinitely … the holidays would get awkward.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="111" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma2lgbpn001l3b736csj9jwz@published"&gt;Ugh, this is awful, and I feel for your husband. Still, I’m afraid that there is not much you can do from your position. He is clearly laboring under the weight of decades of trauma from dealing with these people, and whether or not they are objectively bad, they are certainly bad in your husband’s mind. Planning to never tell your family about the birth of a child is PRETTY EXTREME and a thing like that only comes as a response to something equally as extreme, at least in the mind of your husband. So, there are serious issues here that I’m sure need working out in therapy and over time.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma2lgbpo001m3b73yw9qo7sr@published"&gt;Of course, we both know that it is patently absurd to hide a whole entire child from extended relatives and your husband is, quite frankly, tripping. And of course, you can tell him that. You can encourage him to be honest and you can let him know that there is no good ending to this plan. But if I were in your position, I would stop short of intervening on my own, outing the pregnancy myself, or otherwise taking control of the situation. The family relationships here are clearly messy enough that you would do well to avoid sticking your own foot any further into it than you have to.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma2lgbpo001n3b73bzcjal73@published"&gt;Tell your husband that in every way you think this is a bad idea. But keep in mind that in order to survive, people from traumatic backgrounds often have to explore all manner of methods for differentiation. He may just need time to enjoy the feeling of freedom that comes with this misguided notion before seeing the futility of it in practice. So, one good way to support him is to give him that time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="136" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma2lhwal002l3b73ktjndxws@published"&gt;I have a strange, not-really-a-problem problem. I had my daughter three months ago. I’ve always been tall and thin, and I had a 9-pound baby. I got back to my normal weight almost immediately, just due to good genes I guess. My issue is that women—co-workers, family, people on the street—are pretty mad at me. My co-worker this morning upon seeing me for the first time since returning to work said, “I hate you.” I know this is all meant as a compliment, but I’m really at a loss as to what to say. My mom died while I was pregnant so sometimes I’ve been saying it’s a gift from her (she was always naturally thin). I hate that I’m getting caught up in this scrutiny of women’s bodies and making people feel bad. Any advice?&lt;/p&gt;

She and her husband did not find out the sex of the baby prior. I have two girls, and my older brother has one girl. Upon receiving the group text from my brother-in-law that they had a healthy baby boy, my mother immediately texted back that she was hoping for a boy. That hurt. Are her three granddaughters not good enough?&lt;br&gt;My husband—who was really hoping we’d have a boy, but is still smitten with our two girls—is really upset about the comment. I’m not sure how my brother or his wife took the comment. My sister is already the favorite with my parents, and my husband is convinced that she will now get even more favoritism. We have plans to visit my parents later this summer (we live across the country from my sister and parents), and now my husband no longer wants to go. My husband and I are both excited and very happy for my sister and brother-in-law, but this is just one more thing my mom has said to take an apparent dig at us. I guess my question is, would it be inappropriate to call my mom out on this inappropriate comment? How would I go about doing that?&lt;/p&gt;

I understand your husband’s feelings, but I do not think the solution is to become further estranged over something so small. When you say “This is just one more thing my mom has said,” I think that bears a lot of weight here. When she says things that are &lt;em&gt;actually &lt;/em&gt;clear digs, address them in the moment. You’re building up too much resentment, and it’s spilling over into benign interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

In rats, those that helped distressed peers showed increased activation in empathy- and motivation-related brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These helpful rats also had higher oxytocin receptor expression, suggesting that social bonding, not just emotional distress recognition, may drive prosocial behavior. The findings offer new insights into how attachment and empathy shape helping behavior in both animals and humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Activation:&lt;/strong&gt; Helpful rats showed stronger activity in brain regions linked to empathy and motivation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role of Oxytocin:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher oxytocin receptor levels supported social bonding and increased helping behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prosocial Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Caring for others, more than simply recognizing distress, may drive acts of kindness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are some people more helpful than others? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; paper, Inbal Bartal, from Tel Aviv University, and colleagues used rats to explore why some individuals may be more receptive to the distress of others and how this information leads to helpful behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109305"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a hand and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/oxytocin-help-social-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This work helps us understand prosocial, or helpful, acts better. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a task the researchers previously developed, they observed the behaviors and brain activity of helpful rats compared to less helpful rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this task that probes helping behavior, rats are given the option to release a distressed peer trapped in a restrainer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rats were more likely to come to the aid of others that they had previous positive social interactions with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These helpful rats had increased activity in brain regions associated with empathy and motivation compared to less helpful rats.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also observed that helper rats had increased oxytocin receptor expression in a brain region that drives motivation compared to the less helpful rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, this could mean that caring for others, more than relating to others’ distresses, contributes to helpfulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When oxytocin signaling was inhibited, rats were less friendly with others, suggesting oxytocin may support helping by making rats feel attachment to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We appear to live in an increasingly polarized society where there is a gap in empathy towards others. This work helps us understand prosocial, or helpful, acts better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We see others in distress all the time but tend to help only certain individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The similarity between human and rat brains helps us understand the way our brain mediates prosocial decisions,” says Bartel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and social behavior research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#402d252429210033262e6e2f3227" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN Media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://sfn.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN Media – SfN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0845-24.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neural and Behavioral Correlates of Individual Variability in Rat Helping Behavior: A Role for Social Affiliation and Oxytocin Receptors&lt;/a&gt;” by Inbal Bartal et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural and Behavioral Correlates of Individual Variability in Rat Helping Behavior: A Role for Social Affiliation and Oxytocin Receptors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A prosocial response to others in distress is increasingly recognized as a natural behavior for many social species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While prosocial behavior is more frequently observed towards familiar conspecifics, even within the same social context, some individuals are more prone to help than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a rat helping behavior test where animals can release a distressed conspecific trapped inside a restrainer, most rats are motivated and consistently release the trapped rat (‘openers’), yet around 30% do not open the restrainer (‘non-openers’).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To characterize the difference between these populations, behavioral and neural markers were compared between opener and non-opener rats in males and females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Openers showed significantly more social affiliative behavior both before and after door-opening compared to non-openers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin receptor mRNA levels were higher in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), but not the anterior insula, of openers. Several transcription control pathways were significantly upregulated in openers’ NAc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemogenetically inhibiting paraventricular oxytocin neurons did not significantly impair helping, but did reduce sociality measures, indicating that helping does not rely solely on oxytocin signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of brain-wide neural activity based on the immediate-early gene c-Fos in males revealed increased activity in openers in prosocial brain regions compared to non-openers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include regions associated with empathy in humans (insula, somatosensory, cingulate and frontal cortices), and motivation and reward regions such as the NAc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings indicate that prosocial behavior may be predicted by affiliative behavior and activity in the prosocial neural network and provide targets for the investigation of causal mechanisms underlying prosocial behavior.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 14:31:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFBaX253aXc4cnVfRGF5a0sxQURqNDdpc1JMbUJITXlCS1llT1I2TmlNanZPdVJqaGpWdDk1a202OExqaXVvdGt5NHc4RmY5Q0k4TS00N1plMVVoeGlnaDhPRUp2MmZYTHlNREZ1TEpGU1k</guid></item><item><title>在直播中分享癌症诊断的心爱的电视主播对疾病进行了戏剧性的更新-每日邮报 | Beloved TV anchor who shared cancer diagnosis live on air gives dramatic update on disease - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxNSFFxZF9ybjZpVWtZRmVGQS1weDlud1Z6eU1HWEZLWHVJbzBrWDM1VjdDNHRFdi1PUjZyVWxudTlBVkJwd0ZRRlgzT01aeWxITm1OaHVTdEVrX0JFQVpZcVRjdDhFY2lOWEtGakN0VGxFbDFwOHBLckprX0tUYkZKMi1la1NzNnNxd09ZakVrWURpLWJUY1BXRDRuTWZvamxETGhV0gGoAUFVX3lxTE1LQ0RvYUNwb3FYQTlKQXlaOFYydGc3Qm9hTGlUOTQtRjh0NUoyeXdQWWNJZnZzRFBGejNaajhMc3pMVnlKcnBVWERWSGtBTnNPWF80SzVCMzB3dzliSFIwakozMGR4cTYyWEkzZEludFlUZlJabWhrUEN0RlpPUHFiQW9sU0JrRzFLeGZEdF9HQnRoWXQ2QmJ4UmRpUTc0bzNUWlZuN0laZg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A beloved &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/chicago/index.html" id="mol-f0fecab0-24f6-11f0-81f4-0ff5c46a8d51"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; news anchor gave a positive update about his battle with &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-27a3bd90-2502-11f0-8bf1-1dc27744397b"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;  after opening up about his diagnosis last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://wgntv.com/news/chicago-news/cancer-sucks-wgn-reporter-mike-lowe-reveals-stage-3-colon-cancer-diagnosis/"&gt;WGN-TV&lt;/a&gt; reporter Mike Lowe's latest test results revealed that his colorectal cancer was no longer detectable after a yearlong battle with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Getting those results, it was just the most amazing feeling,' Lowe told the &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/04/28/wgn-mike-lowe-cancer/"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think back to one year ago, when I went to the initial doctor's appointment... In some ways it feels like forever and in some ways, it feels like the blink of an eye - but what a year.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the past year, Lowe has shared his journey with WGN, allowing cameras into his appointments and raising awareness about the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The anchor shared his Stage 3 diagnosis on &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C7B1Fxsg3qS/?img_index=9"&gt;Instagram &lt;/a&gt;in May 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Cancer sucks, but it's growing on me. I wanted to let you know that I was diagnosed with Stage 3(c)/N+ colon cancer, and I'll be participating in a clinical trial with Northwestern Medicine,' he wrote at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lowe said that he would be undergoing radiation and chemotherapy for six months before undergoing surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;WGN-TV reporter Mike Lowe's latest test results revealed that his cancer was no longer detectable after a yearlong battle with the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Over the last year, Lowe has shared his journey with viewers, allowing cameras into his appointments and raising awareness about the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In May 2024, Lowe shared his diagnosis of Stage 3 colorectal cancer, the same type that Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman died from in 2020&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added that 'Stage 3 is serious,' noting that Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-8676047/Black-Panther-actor-Chadwick-Boseman-dies-43-battle-cancer.html"&gt;died from Stage 3 colon cancer in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But I'm staying 100 percent positive. I've got a great team of doctors, all of whom say this could be curable cancer...It's worth noting that colon cancer is rising rapidly in younger people (20s,30s, and 40s),' Lowe wrote, urging viewers to get a colonoscopy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I haven't even reached the age recommended for a routine screening, which is 45. So, if you're experiencing symptoms like constipation or abdominal pain, go see a doctor.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The reporter told the Chicago Tribune that the &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-12156615/Cancer-epidemic-young-people-laid-bare-colorectal-cancer-cases-40s-DOUBLED-2030.html"&gt;alarming increase of colon cancer in young people&lt;/a&gt; is 'a public health crisis in this country.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Younger and younger people are being diagnosed with colorectal cancer,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the last 30 years, diagnoses of the disease in younger people have shot up by 80 percent across the globe, research suggests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In contrast, rates of the disease in older groups, who are statistically more likely to be diagnosed with it, have either declined or remained stable over the same period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People aged 54 or younger made up about 20 percent of colorectal cancer cases in 2019, a percentage that has doubled from 1995, according to the &lt;a target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures-2023.pdf"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'It's worth noting that colon cancer is rising rapidly in younger people (20s,30s, and 40s),' Lowe wrote, as he urged viewers to get a colonoscopy.

'Mike has been extraordinarily brave to share his story, and there's no doubt in my mind that it's going to benefit a huge amount of people who are going to go for early colorectal cancer screenings so they can catch it in a time where we can intervene in a meaningful way.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lowe shared his journey with viewers and continued to work as much as possible while he was undergoing treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I wanted cancer to be something important that was going on in the background of my life but not completely dominating it,' he told the Tribune. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If I could have a real purpose and go to work and feel like I was able to do it and do it well still, then I was going to do it no matter what.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'I wanted to kind of demystify cancer treatment or show exactly what it looks like,' Lowe said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lowe continued working as much as he could, including rushing from cancer treatments in the morning to work or keeping a zippered pouch across his chest which contained medicine moving through a tube to a port in his chest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He continued working as much as he could, including rushing from treatments in the morning to work or keeping a zippered pouch across his chest that contained medicine moving through a tube to a port in his chest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There were certain setbacks, but he just tackled each and every one of them and wanted to keep working as much as he could,' said WGN-TV News Director Dominick Stasi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He approached the whole thing with a positive attitude. It was really kind of inspiring.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The anchor experienced increasingly difficult symptoms as his treatment continued, including nausea, numbness in his extremities, and peeling on his feet and palms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he rarely took much medical leave from his job and instead brought the camera crew with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I wanted to kind of demystify cancer treatment or show exactly what it looks like,' Lowe told the Tribune. 'If you can help anybody understand what they're about to go through, I think that helps, and the position of a journalist is to do that, to explain things and make them more understandable.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In January, after his treatments, he had an MRI and a sigmoidoscopy to see if the cancer was still present. If it was, he would next need to undergo surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he was given tentatively good news: The doctor couldn't see the tumor anymore, the Tribune reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The anchor experienced increasingly difficult symptoms as his treatment continued, including nausea, numbness in his extremities, and peeling on his feet and palms.

Imaging tests were ordered, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;After a CT scan, an ER doctor came in “and just kind of said, ‘Tumor this’ and ‘Tumor that,’” she recalled. “That’s how we found out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The diagnosis: Stage 4 &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/adrenocortical/patient/adrenocortical-treatment-pdq" target="_blank"&gt;adrenocortical carcinoma&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She had a baseball-size tumor on her adrenal gland, several tumors in her liver and several in her lungs that were marble to golf ball size. The cancer was aggressive and growing quickly, Matt Goodrich says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is adrenocortical carcinoma?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The adrenal glands are two small organs located above each kidney. Their outer layer produces hormones important for the body to function properly, including controlling water balance, blood pressure and the stress response, the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/pediatric-adult-rare-tumor/rare-tumors/rare-endocrine-tumor/adrenocortical-carcinoma" target="_blank"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt; notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Adrenocortical carcinoma is a cancer that develops in this outer layer of the adrenal glands. It’s more common in women than men. The average age of onset is 46, according to &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/adrenocortical-carcinoma" target="_blank"&gt;Yale Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Symptoms include abdominal pain or fullness, fluid retention, bloating and high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A tumor can produce too many hormones, which is what happened to Angela Goodrich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s just a very strange cancer,” she noted, likening some of the effects to end of pregnancy symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Her cortisol levels became “super high,” Matt Goodrich says, which can lead to &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000407.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Cushing syndrome&lt;/a&gt; — a disorder that causes a round full face, weight gain, fat around the midsection, back and bone pain and mental changes such as confusion. It’s also associated with low potassium levels in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The cancer runs in families 50% of the time, but Angela Goodrich said she had no family history of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There were few treatment options available since so many tumors had already grown in her body by the time the cancer was discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She began chemotherapy just before Easter. The family was grateful to people who brought meals, cleaned the house and offered help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I really appreciate all the support and love we’ve received from the community and friends and family, and just from everywhere. So a lot of gratitude,” Angela Goodrich told TODAY.com the day before she died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/mom-of-10-dies-cancer-zz-250428-01-0aba8a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/mom-of-10-dies-cancer-zz-250428-01-0aba8a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/mom-of-10-dies-cancer-zz-250428-01-0aba8a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/mom-of-10-dies-cancer-zz-250428-01-0aba8a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/mom-of-10-dies-cancer-zz-250428-01-0aba8a.jpg" alt="Goodrich recently became a grandmother."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Goodrich recently became a grandmother.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Matt Goodrich&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Her cancer was extremely advanced and her body was failing before she started chemotherapy, her husband says.

The findings suggest vasopressin deficiency may underlie social difficulties seen in autism spectrum disorder (ASD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monkeys given vasopressin became more responsive to prosocial cues and better at remembering faces, critical skills often impaired in ASD. This work opens new avenues for precision therapies aimed at addressing core social deficits in autism rather than just managing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Gains Without Aggression:&lt;/strong&gt; Vasopressin improved prosocial behavior and facial memory without increasing aggression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological Link to ASD:&lt;/strong&gt; Low-social monkeys naturally mirror some social impairments seen in humans with autism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Vasopressin supplementation could offer a future targeted treatment for core social deficits in ASD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Florida Institute of Technology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For years, Florida Tech’s Catherine Talbot, an assistant professor of psychology, has worked to understand the sociality of male rhesus monkeys and how low-social monkeys can serve as a model for humans with autism. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her most recent findings show that replenishing a deficient hormone, vasopressin, helped the monkeys become more social without increasing their aggression—a discovery that could change autism treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109297"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two people." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vassopressin-social-ASD-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;One of Talbot’s co-authors has already begun translating this work to cohorts of autism patients. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that one in 36 children in the United States is affected by autism spectrum disorder (ASD). That’s an increase from one in 44 children reported in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two FDA-approved treatments currently exist, Talbot said, but they only address associated symptoms, not the root of ASD. The boost in both prevalence and awareness of the disorder prompts the following question: What is the cause?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some rhesus monkeys are naturally low-social, meaning they demonstrate poor social cognitive skills, while others are highly social.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their individual variation in sociality is comparable to how human sociality varies, ranging from people we consider social butterflies to those who are not interested in social interactions, similar to some people diagnosed with ASD, Talbot said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her goal has been to understand how variations in biology and behavior influence social cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a research paper published in the journal &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, Talbot and researchers with Stanford, the University of California, Davis and the California National Primate Research Center explored vasopressin, a hormone that is known to contribute to mammalian social behavior, as a potential therapeutic treatment that may ultimately help people with autism better function in society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous work from this research group had found that vasopressin levels are lower in their low-social rhesus monkey model, as well as in a select group of people with ASD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies testing vasopressin in rodents had found that increased hormone levels caused more aggression. As a result, researchers warned against administering vasopressin as a treatment, Talbot said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, she argued that in those studies, vasopressin induced aggression in contexts where aggression is the socially appropriate response, such as guarding mates in their home territory, so the hormone may promote species-typical behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also noted that the previous studies tested vasopressin in “neurotypical” rodents, as opposed to animals with low-social tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It may be that individuals with the lowest levels of vasopressin may benefit the most from it—that is the step forward toward precision medicine that we now need to study,” Talbot said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her latest paper, Talbot and her co-authors tested how low-social monkeys with low vasopressin levels and high autistic-like trait burden responded to vasopressin supplementation to make up for their natural deficiency. They administered the hormone through a nebulizer, into which the monkeys could opt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a few minutes each week, the monkeys voluntarily held their faces up to a nebulizer to receive their dose while sipping white grape juice—a favorite among the monkeys, Talbot said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After administering the hormone and verifying that it increased vasopressin levels in the central nervous system, the researchers wanted to see how the monkeys responded to both affiliative and aggressive stimuli by showing them videos depicting these behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also compared their ability to recognize and remember new objects and faces, which is another important social skill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that normally low-social monkeys do not respond to social communication and were better at recognizing and remembering objects compared to faces, similar to some humans diagnosed with ASD. When the monkeys were given vasopressin, they began reciprocating affiliative, pro-social behaviors, but not aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also improved their facial recognition memory, making it equivalent to their recognition memory of objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, vasopressin “rescued” low-social monkeys’ ability to respond prosocially to others and to remember new faces. The treatment was successful—vasopressin selectively improved the social cognition of these low-social monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was really exciting to see this come to fruition after pouring so much work into this project and overcoming so many challenges,” Talbot said of her findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Talbot’s co-authors has already begun translating this work to cohorts of autism patients. She expects more clinical trials to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the immediate future, Talbot is examining how other, more complex social cognitive abilities like theory of mind—the ability to take the perspective of another—may differ in low-social monkeys compared to more social monkeys and how this relates to their underlying biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, Talbot hopes that they can target young monkeys who are at risk of developing social deficits related to autism for vasopressin treatment, to see if early intervention might help change their developmental trajectory and eventually translate this therapy to targeted human trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Autism and social neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Madeline Taylor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Florida Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Madeline Taylor – Florida Institute of Technology&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2418635121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nebulized vasopressin penetrates CSF and improves social cognition without inducing aggression in a rhesus monkey model of autism&lt;/a&gt;” by Catherine F.

Test 1: Placebo-administered monkeys lacked face recognition memory, whereas face recognition memory was “rescued” following AVP administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, object recognition memory was intact and did not differ between administration conditions. Test 2: Placebo-administered monkeys did not respond to conspecific social communication cues, whereas following AVP administration, they reciprocated affiliative communication cues with species-typical affiliative responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, AVP administration did not increase aggressive responses to conspecific aggressive or affiliative overtures. Study 2 (N = 4) evaluated the pharmacokinetics of this administration method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following AVP nebulization, we observed a linear increase in cisternal CSF AVP levels, and a quadratic rise and fall in blood AVP levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings indicate that nebulized AVP likely penetrates the central nervous system, selectively promotes species-typical responses to social information, and does not induce aggression in low-social individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nebulized AVP therefore may hold promise for managing similar social symptoms in people with autism, particularly in very young or lower functioning individuals.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 13:42:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE95N3BJRXhJYlFudnNFbk5YSG9MbU5yUEZtTG14d3FQV0NiT3hjRlJUb1J5OHJBUTI0bWVNTkFJOTFNTk9jeXhWd29fbEpnT1V5TWticTFDQmJCUWxKUnZMUHBvNzFfcURZUkE</guid></item><item><title>专家正在告诉我们您的月经如何严重影响这个身体部位- BuzzFeed | Experts Are Telling Us How Your Period Can Seriously Impact This One Body Part - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE1ObG9USjhmZ2R2cXVLdmVTV0Z6UHJ3Z2pDYVdGdU1WenBCSGFfVGxXa19talpWeG1QbEthbnZCTGw4N3lJVW9WUUg4aTRtSF9GcEdscDJBUU5qMG1udmttb0xXbHB2LUU0ZzQwczVZcmUtSFctaHRpR3hn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;“Hormonal fluctuations during your menstrual cycle can cause your gums to be more sensitive and prone to inflammation,” &lt;a href="https://bhdentalarts.com/about/meet-dr-rajpal/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7868860" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Anjali Rajpal&lt;/a&gt;, a dentist and founder of Beverly Hills Dental Arts, told HuffPost. “The hormonal changes can cause your gums to be more reactive to the bacteria in plaque, increasing the chances of gingivitis or early stage gum disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reaction specifically stems from the change in estrogen and progesterone levels before and during your period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As estrogen levels increase, there is more blood flow to the gums, and progesterone can also increase inflammation, sometimes making the gums more reactive,” said &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1023156627/margaret-nachtigall" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7868860" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Margaret Nachtigall&lt;/a&gt;, a reproductive endocrinologist and clinical associate professor in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at NYU Langone Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of these hormonal shifts, your gum tissue might become more swollen and tender and even bleed. Redness and irritation are common. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s somewhat like how hormones can impact your mood ― they similarly influence your oral tissues and their response to daily stresses like microbes,” said &lt;a href="https://drkamihoss.com/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7868860" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Kami Hoss&lt;/a&gt;, a dentist and author of &lt;em&gt;If Your Mouth Could Talk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These fluctuations temporarily alter the environment of your mouth and shift the balance of inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Higher estrogen and progesterone levels cause the blood vessels in the gingival tissues to dilate, making them more sensitive, swollen, and also prone to bleeding,” said &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.instagram.com_dr.erin.ortho_&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;amp;r=l8J-SPajWqKM0HqnabEg6YaOmCZlOSGFcU6_RHN2n64&amp;amp;m=t2w5s3IGnw6hUij-x62FpbY-LCqke1kWEua5ClBfhgPdX1iMVoFyz7NbZPutajep&amp;amp;s=GJc6wWGS8XHQ7nLAxObqrPgXL1f3gV9vocmPmweN9Oc&amp;amp;e=" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7868860"&gt;Dr. Erin Fraundorf&lt;/a&gt;, an orthodontist and founder of &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.boca-2Dstudio.com_&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;amp;r=l8J-SPajWqKM0HqnabEg6YaOmCZlOSGFcU6_RHN2n64&amp;amp;m=t2w5s3IGnw6hUij-x62FpbY-LCqke1kWEua5ClBfhgPdX1iMVoFyz7NbZPutajep&amp;amp;s=0AfeQiIn5zx5PZHcus3l4pBnpkcTDwXIGOpIESW7IcI&amp;amp;e=" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7868860" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Boca Studio&lt;/a&gt;. “Similar to bloating in other parts of the body during menstruation, gum tissues may retain additional fluid, adding to the feeling of tenderness or puffiness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that you might experience a heightened immune response during this time as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Basically, the progesterone can affect how the collagen of the gingiva gets produced, and it can affect the capillary permeability as well,” said &lt;a href="https://www.orlandohealth.com/physician-finder/christine-carlan-greves-md#/overview" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7868860" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Christine Greves&lt;/a&gt;, an OB-GYN at Orlando Health Women’s Institute Center for Obstetrics &amp;amp; Gynecology. “This can result in the production of more prostaglandins, which are basically compounds that can cause inflammation and pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts also refer to this phenomenon as “menstruation gingivitis.” Similar conditions can occur during puberty and pregnancy as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pregnant women or people taking birth control pills can notice changes in their gum health,” noted &lt;a href="https://www.toothclub.co.uk/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7868860" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Sepideh Jalali&lt;/a&gt;, a dentist with The Tooth Club. “And if you are dealing with PCOS, endometriosis, or hormone therapy, your gums will become more sensitive.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How else can your menstrual cycle affect your oral health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

In Sweden, there are approximately 22,000 people living with MS. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most patients start with the relapsing-remitting form (RRMS), which is characterised by episodes of deterioration with intervening periods of stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109293"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ai-Ms-progression-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ai-Ms-progression-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ai-Ms-progression-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ai-Ms-progression-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ai-Ms-progression-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ai-Ms-progression-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ai-Ms-progression-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ai-Ms-progression-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ai-Ms-progression-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ai-Ms-progression-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ai-Ms-progression-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ai-Ms-progression-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ai-Ms-progression-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ai-Ms-progression-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ai-Ms-progression-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The model is based on data already collected during regular healthcare visits, such as neurological tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and ongoing treatments. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, many people transition to secondary progressive MS (SPMS), where their symptoms instead get steadily worse, without obvious breaks. Identifying this transition is important because the two different forms of MS require different treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the diagnosis is made on average three years after the transition begins, which can lead to patients receiving medicines that are no longer effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Based on Swedish MS data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new AI model summarises clinical data from over 22,000 patients in the Swedish MS Registry. The model is based on data already collected during regular healthcare visits, such as neurological tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and ongoing treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By recognising patterns from previous patients, the model can determine whether a patient has the relapsing-remitting form or whether the disease has transitioned to secondary progressive MS. What is unique about the model is that it also indicates how confident it is in each individual assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This means that the doctor will know how reliable the conclusion is and how confident the AI is in its assessment,” says Kim Kultima, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ninety per cent accuracy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, now published in the journal Digital Medicine, the model correctly identified the transition to secondary progressive MS in almost 87 percent of cases, or earlier than documented in the patient’s medical records, with an overall accuracy of around 90 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For patients, this means that the diagnosis can be made earlier, which makes it possible to adjust the patient’s treatment in time and slow down the progression of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This also reduces the risk of patients receiving medicines that are no longer effective.

They do, however, emphasize the significance of taking preventative measures, particularly for people who have intimate contact with affected animals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to producing outbreaks in poultry and US dairy cows, the CDC reports that H5 bird flu is common in wild birds around the world and has recently been linked to multiple human cases among dairy and poultry workers in the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although there is currently little risk to the public's health, the CDC is closely monitoring the situation and collaborating with states to keep an eye on anyone who have been exposed to animals.

They also underscore the “very real consequences” that cancer treatment can have for women after they’ve entered remission, said Joseph Unger, a biostatician and cancer researcher with the Fred Hutch Cancer Center in Seattle who was not involved in the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Cancer treatments are becoming more effective at keeping patients alive and turning cancer into more of a chronic disease,” said Unger, who studies cancer patients’ quality of life. “Understandably, patients don’t want to just live, they want to live well. So, that’s really where this research helps to point us in the next direction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Simo Du, lead author of the study and internal medicine resident physician at NYC Health + Hospitals/Jacobi, had noticed that many more female than male cancer survivors in her clinic were complaining of fatigue that made it hard to shop for groceries, get dressed, shower and do other social or hygiene-related activities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;To better understand how this disparity affected patients’ quality of life, Du and her colleagues analyzed responses from 1,555 adult &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/colon-cancer-young-people-describe-signs-ignored-rcna129838" target="_blank"&gt;cancer survivors&lt;/a&gt; that were included in the 2015-2016 and 2017-2020 cohorts of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Participants answered questions about whether they feel hopeless, deal with poor appetite, experience trouble sleeping and have thoughts of self-harm. They also completed questionnaires about the type of physical activities they participate in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Overall, the researchers said, the responses could be extrapolated to 25 million survivors with over 20 different types of cancer across the U.S., including those of the prostate, breast, skin, colon and cervix. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The findings have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Why women have worse quality of life after cancer &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The study found that, compared with male survivors, female cancer survivors were 69% more likely to report cancer-related fatigue and 58% more likely to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/depression-cancer-patients-oncology-gap-anxiety-rcna179852" target="_blank"&gt;report depression&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While fatigue is already known to affect &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/fatigue" target="_blank"&gt;more than 80% of people with cancer&lt;/a&gt;, the study found that women were 1.5 times more likely than men to experience it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Cancer treatments affect the entire body, as they can kill both cancerous and healthy cells, said Carolyn Gotay, cancer researcher and professor emeritus of population and public health at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver who was not involved in the study. These effects can persist for months to years after treatment is done, she said, leaving survivors with a host of health issues from deafness to infertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Cancer-related fatigue and depression can be caused by cancer itself or the other medical conditions it causes, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/fatigue" target="_blank"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;. The emotional impact of dealing with the disease can also cause these symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Why women bear the brunt of these effects remains unclear, although experts have some theories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Research shows that women have stronger immune responses to treatments, which causes greater inflammation. Women also tend to clear drugs from their bodies more slowly than men, Du said, leading to higher concentrations of medications in their system and thus worse symptoms. It’s possible, too, that differences in body size affect how drugs and radiation are distributed and absorbed in women’s bodies.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Women are also more likely to develop cancers that are treated with hormone therapies that can contribute greatly to fatigue and depression, Du said. Some of these therapies, like &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/treatment/hormone-therapy-for-breast-cancer.html" target="_blank"&gt;tamoxifen&lt;/a&gt; that’s used to treat some breast cancers, are taken for five to 10 years after remission to lower the chances the cancer returns, according to the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;That said, women are more likely to report &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13548506.2025.2490212?src=" target="_blank"&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/depression/art-20047725" target="_blank"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; even without a cancer diagnosis, Gotay said, so it’s possible that sex-related hormone differences might better explain why women experience more of these symptoms from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Du said that it’s also possible social gender norms play a role. Women typically have more caretaker responsibilities like tending to children and chores that can increase stress and contribute to fatigue and depression, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Notably, the study found that men were more likely to have thoughts “that they would be better off dead,” Du said. This finding mirrors other data that shows &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/suicide/facts/data.html#:~:text=Suicide%20rate%20disparities&amp;amp;text=The%20suicide%20rate%20among%20males,but%20nearly%2080%25%20of%20suicides.&amp;amp;text=Data%20table%20showing%20data%20for%20the%20chart%20figure.,-SexPress%20command" target="_blank"&gt;suicide rates are generally higher in men&lt;/a&gt; than in women. Du speculated that social norms, namely expectations that men should be able to provide for their families, could be to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;How exercise can help&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The study also found that, among all cancer survivors, those who did moderate physical activity such as walking or cycling had a 50% lower risk of cancer-related fatigue. Those who participated in more vigorous activity didn’t see any improvements in their energy, Du said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Meanwhile, both moderate and vigorous activity was associated with a two- to five-fold decrease in depression risk, according to the research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Overall, the results suggest that post-cancer therapy programs should prioritize exercise. A &lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.24.00541#:~:text=Prevalence%20estimates%20indicate%20that%2030,or%20years%20after%20treatment%20completion." target="_blank"&gt;2024 review of 113 randomized controlled trials&lt;/a&gt; came to similar conclusions, and found that exercise, along with cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based programs, improved cancer-related fatigue both during and after cancer treatment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We always prescribe medications” to help cancer survivors cope with lingering symptoms, Du said. “But for cancer-related fatigue, exercise may actually work better than pharmaceutical interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Even still, exercise may be a bandage solution, Unger said, treating just the symptom and not the root cause. Future research needs to investigate why women experience worse side effects after cancer so they can benefit from more effective treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In the meantime, Gotay said she hopes the study helps normalize the idea that it’s OK to not feel OK after surviving cancer, which can be tough for many survivors to understand and accept. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“When people survive cancer and have fatigue or depression, they think that something is wrong with them because they’re not grateful,” Gotay said. “But they shouldn’t feel alone … or as though they’re deficient.

A sizable number of patients do not respond to first-line treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive neuromodulation is a second-line treatment approach, but current methods rely on cortical targets to indirectly modulate subcortical structures, e.g., the amygdala, implicated in MATRDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) is a non-invasive technique for direct subcortical neuromodulation, but its safety, feasibility, and promise as a potential treatment is largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a target engagement study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided tFUS to the left amygdala was administered during functional MRI (tFUS/fMRI) to test for acute modulation of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal in a double-blind, within-subject, sham-controlled design in patients with MATRDs (N = 29) and healthy comparison subjects (N = 23).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an unblinded treatment trial, the same patients then underwent 3-week daily (15 sessions) MRI-guided repetitive tFUS (rtFUS) to the left amygdala to examine safety, feasibility, symptom change, and change in amygdala reactivity to emotional faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Active vs. sham tFUS/fMRI reduced, on average, left amygdala BOLD signal and produced patient-related differences in hippocampal and insular responses. rtFUS was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were significant reductions on the primary outcome (Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire General Distress subscale; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001, Cohen’s &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt; = 0.77), secondary outcomes (Cohen’s &lt;em&gt;d of&lt;/em&gt; 0.43–1.50), and amygdala activation to emotional stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings provide initial evidence of tFUS capability to modulate amygdala function, rtFUS safety and feasibility in MATRDs, and motivate double-blind randomized controlled trials to examine efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 12:45:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE1GQXp4N2hkNWVkcUd3Y0cwVDloODJfZXpMbmt3OEtlWEpjc1licHpWVW5YZ3NtREIwdEIydDdDSnUxekoyUWx6MDFlcnR4THFxZWdMaW9iVzhQb3c2UWhvUWtxczd6eHJvUW13QlFoeFItQlVJeVZxX0wwNkNGbUE</guid></item><item><title>超加工食品与全球过早死亡人数上升相关-神经科学新闻 | Ultraprocessed Foods Linked to Rising Premature Deaths Worldwide - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE1jeUtEY3pUMVBxMC14NEoycnBKZlcxa2ZUX251MXI0eVRLdjE2VElVR2VBNXZYeHZyYnhLT2xNSEVUTW4yaS1GYjZ0UWRHeDhRa28zUXB3alZjWURQRlNRVUhkdW9CbG0yWjhMMkJJekVqNVFt?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study across eight countries shows that higher consumption of ultraprocessed foods (UPFs) is significantly linked to increased premature deaths. Researchers found that each 10% rise in UPFs’ share of total energy intake raises all-cause mortality risk by 3%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countries with the highest UPF consumption, like the U.S., see up to 14% of premature deaths attributed to these foods.

These have gradually been replacing traditional foods and meals made from fresh and minimally processed ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead investigator of the study Eduardo Augusto Fernandes Nilson, DSc, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), Brazil, says, “UPFs affect health beyond the individual impact of high content of critical nutrients (sodium, trans fats, and sugar) because of the changes in the foods during industrial processing and the use of artificial ingredients, including colorants, artificial flavors and sweeteners, emulsifiers, and many other additives and processing aids, so assessing deaths from all-causes associated with UPF consumption allows an overall estimate of the effect of industrial food processing on health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While previous studies focused on specific dietary risk factors instead of food patterns, the current study modeled data from nationally representative dietary surveys and mortality data from eight countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, United Kingdom, and United States) to link dietary patterns, considering the extent and purpose of industrial food processing, to deaths from all causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nilson explains, “We first estimated a linear association between the dietary share of UPFs and all-cause mortality, so that each 10% increase in the participation of UPFs in the diet increases the risk of death from all causes by 3%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Then, using the relative risks and the food consumption data for all countries (ranging from 15% of the total energy intake in Colombia, to over 50% of the calories in the United States), we built a model that estimated that the percentage of all-cause premature preventable deaths due to the consumption of UPFs can vary from 4% in countries with lower UPF consumption to almost 14% in countries with the highest UPF consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, in 2018, 124,000 premature deaths were attributable to the consumption of UPFs in the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High consumption of UPFs has been associated with 32 different diseases, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, some types of cancer, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, this study has estimated the burden of UPF intake on premature deaths from all-causes in different countries, showing that the attributable mortality is significant in all settings and that addressing UPF consumption should be a global public nutrition priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nilson notes, “It is concerning that, while in high-income countries UPF consumption is already high but relatively stable for over a decade, in low- and middle-income countries the consumption has continuously increased, meaning that while the attributable burden in high-income countries is currently higher, it is growing in the other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This shows that policies that disincentivize the consumption of UPFs are urgently needed globally, promoting traditional dietary patterns based on local fresh and minimally processed foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and mortality research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.elsevier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Astrid Engelen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.elsevier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Elsevier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Astrid Engelen – Elsevier&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2025.02.018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Premature Mortality Attributable to Ultraprocessed Food Consumption in 8 Countries&lt;/a&gt;” by Eduardo A.F.

Prospective cohort studies have consistently found an association between high consumption of ultraprocessed foods and increased risk of several noncommunicable diseases and all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study aimed to (1) estimate the risk of all-cause mortality for ultraprocessed foods consumption and (2) estimate the attributable epidemiologic burden of ultraprocessed food consumption in 8 select countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, a dose–response meta-analysis of observational cohort studies was performed to assess the association between ultraprocessed food consumption and all-cause mortality and estimated the pooled RR for all-cause mortality per each 10% increment in the percentage ultraprocessed food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, the population attributable fractions for premature all-cause mortality attributable to the ultraprocessed foods in consumption were estimated in 8 select countries with relatively low (Colombia and Brazil), intermediate (Chile and Mexico), and high (Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, and the U.S.) ultraprocessed food consumption. Analysis was conducted in November 2023–July 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meta-analysis showed a linear dose–response association between the ultraprocessed food consumption and all-cause mortality (RR for each 10% increase in percentage ultraprocessed food=1.03; 95% CI=1.02, 1.04).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering the magnitude of the association between ultraprocessed foods intake and all-cause mortality and the ultraprocessed food dietary share number (percentage ultraprocessed food) in each of the 8 selected countries, estimations varied from 4% (Colombia) to 14% (United Kingdom and U.S.) of premature deaths attributable to ultraprocessed food intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings support that ultraprocessed food intake contributes significantly to the overall burden of disease in many countries, and its reduction should be included in national dietary guideline recommendations and addressed in public policies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 12:19:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE1jeUtEY3pUMVBxMC14NEoycnBKZlcxa2ZUX251MXI0eVRLdjE2VElVR2VBNXZYeHZyYnhLT2xNSEVUTW4yaS1GYjZ0UWRHeDhRa28zUXB3alZjWURQRlNRVUhkdW9CbG0yWjhMMkJJekVqNVFt</guid></item><item><title>人工智能模型使用虚拟现实和眼球运动数据预测成人多动症- PsyPost | AI model predicts adult ADHD using virtual reality and eye movement data - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxOd3pPUkZ2TVFfRXhlcEJSWEVGZGFnc25GTEc1YlhwZGRobDdJM3ZDdTJLMzBGZTlfZXlSSkVkZVFINncwazhjbW1vN3Fuc29kc2tILVY1VU9LdTQ1TkkwNms2WHJHMEU5dHk3cm92b3NCZzhDNWp2RWZvZVNnNkF4WlU3S1RraV9aQXcxVGd0Y2NIblZoM0lsUDRXSXJGZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-024-03217-y" target="_blank"&gt;Translational Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; suggests that combining virtual reality, eye tracking, head movement data, and self-reported symptoms may help identify attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults with improved accuracy. In a diagnostic task designed to mimic real-world distractions, researchers found that their machine learning model could distinguish adults with ADHD from those without the condition 81% of the time when tested on an independent sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition marked by inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. While it is often diagnosed in childhood, it also affects millions of adults. Diagnosing the disorder in adults can be especially difficult because it typically relies on clinical interviews and retrospective self-reports. These methods are prone to error due to biased memory or intentional misreporting. Unlike some medical conditions, there are no established biomarkers or lab tests that can confirm an ADHD diagnosis. As a result, misdiagnosis remains a serious problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address these challenges, the research team aimed to improve diagnostic accuracy by using a multimodal assessment approach that mirrors the real-world experience of people with ADHD. They combined performance on a sustained attention task with eye tracking, head motion measurements, electroencephalography (EEG), and real-time self-reports. Participants completed the task in a simulated seminar room using virtual reality, where distractions like noise or movement were introduced to mimic everyday interruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ADHD is a complex and heterogeneous disorder and, to date, no cognitive tests or (bio)markers exist that can accurately and reliably detect it. Nonetheless, such objective measures would significantly facilitate the diagnostic process,” said co-first author Benjamin Selaskowski, who is affiliated with the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the University Hospital Bonn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Preliminary evidence suggests combining multiple assessment modalities may improve diagnostic accuracy. Further, there is evidence that virtual reality (VR) can improve the diagnostic accuracy of cognitive tests in ADHD by providing a realistic, ecologically valid test environment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Therefore, in the present study we aimed to investigate whether integrating a VR-based cognitive test with tracking of head and eye movements, assessment of brain activity (via EEG), and real-time self-assessment of symptoms during the task could yield high accuracy in distinguishing adults with and without ADHD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, the researchers collected training data from 50 adults—25 with ADHD and 25 without. In the second, they tested the predictive accuracy of their model on a separate group of 36 participants—18 with ADHD and 18 without. This step was critical to ensure the model could generalize beyond the group it was trained on. Each participant wore a VR headset and completed a continuous performance task (CPT), which required them to press a button in response to certain letter sequences while ignoring distractors. Their responses, head and eye movements, brain activity, and symptom self-ratings were recorded during the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The machine learning model was trained to identify patterns across these different types of data that were most predictive of ADHD. To ensure that the model focused on the most informative features, the researchers used a statistical method known as maximal relevance and minimal redundancy (MRMR), which selects variables that are both strongly related to the diagnosis and relatively uncorrelated with each other. Out of 76 total features, the optimal model used only 11 to achieve the highest performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These features came from four of the five data sources: self-reported symptoms, eye tracking, task performance, and head movement. Among the most important predictors were how much a participant’s gaze wandered, how variable their reaction times were, and how much they moved their head during the task. Self-reported ratings of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity also played a key role, although the researchers caution that self-assessments have known limitations in people with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When applied to the independent test set, the model achieved an overall accuracy of 81%, with a sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 83%. This means it correctly identified 78% of ADHD cases and 83% of non-ADHD cases. These numbers are similar to those found in earlier machine learning studies of ADHD, but with a key difference: most prior research did not test their models on separate, independent data. This step is essential to avoid overestimating how well a model will perform in real-world settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study shows that combining multiple types of information can effectively help identify adults with ADHD,” explained co-first author Annika Wiebe. “Based on data from a group of adults with and without ADHD, we identified performance in a virtual attention task, eye movements, head motion, and self-reported symptoms during the VR scenario as most relevant for distinguishing individuals with ADHD. These findings highlight the potential of using a multi-method assessment to improve the accuracy and objectivity of ADHD diagnosis in adults.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of a virtual reality setting was especially important. Traditional attention tests are often done in quiet, sterile lab environments, which do not reflect the noisy, distracting situations in which people with ADHD often struggle. By placing participants in a more realistic environment and introducing distractions, the researchers were able to capture behaviors that may not emerge in standard tests. This approach increases what’s known as ecological validity—the extent to which a test resembles real-life situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also sheds light on the relative value of different data sources. While EEG is often considered a promising avenue for identifying biomarkers of mental health conditions, it did not improve classification accuracy in this case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found it interesting that our investigated EEG parameters did not contribute to the predictive accuracy of our model,” Selaskowski told PsyPost. “Despite EEG’s common use in ADHD research, our results suggest that other measures – such as eye tracking, head movement, and self-reported symptoms during VR tasks – are more informative for distinguishing ADHD in adults.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its promising findings, the study does have limitations. The sample size was relatively small, with only 86 participants across both the training and test sets. This limits the generalizability of the results, although the use of a separate validation sample does strengthen the conclusions. “Further research with larger and more diverse populations is necessary to validate and refine this diagnostic approach,” Wiebe said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We aim to develop a standardized, efficient, and ecologically valid diagnostic tool for adult ADHD that can be easily implemented in clinical settings,” Selaskowski explained. “By refining our VR-based assessment and validating it across larger and more diverse populations, we hope to enhance the accuracy and reliability of ADHD diagnoses and potentially apply this approach to other neurodevelopmental disorders. With our multi-method approach, we hope to be able to capture a more comprehensive picture of an individual’s cognitive and behavioral functioning, leading to more accurate and personalized diagnoses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings highlight the importance of integrating multiple assessment modalities when diagnosing complex conditions such as ADHD,” Wiebe added. “Importantly, unlike most previous machine learning research in ADHD, our study validated the predictive model on an independent test dataset, which strengthens the reliability and potential clinical relevance of our findings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-024-03217-y" target="_blank"&gt;Virtual reality-assisted prediction of adult ADHD based on eye tracking, EEG, actigraphy and behavioral indices: a machine learning analysis of independent training and test samples&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Annika Wiebe, Benjamin Selaskowski, Martha Paskin, Laura Asché, Julian Pakos, Behrem Aslan, Silke Lux, Alexandra Philipsen, and Niclas Braun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 12:11:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxOd3pPUkZ2TVFfRXhlcEJSWEVGZGFnc25GTEc1YlhwZGRobDdJM3ZDdTJLMzBGZTlfZXlSSkVkZVFINncwazhjbW1vN3Fuc29kc2tILVY1VU9LdTQ1TkkwNms2WHJHMEU5dHk3cm92b3NCZzhDNWp2RWZvZVNnNkF4WlU3S1RraV9aQXcxVGd0Y2NIblZoM0lsUDRXSXJGZw</guid></item><item><title>吃一种含有“关键”营养素的水果可以帮助血压- Surrey Live | Blood pressure can be helped by eating one fruit with 'crucial' nutrient - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOY1hsX252UEd5cjVySmpKN0ZIbi15MVdZaTdNT1FDdTIzQlBxYm5jNnRhcTJwMWsydE44WXJBSHBJVmZNSVFwS1M2ZlQwNDBHOS1oZzBWTzdtd3lZd0FmZGVVQWtXRi1mQlFoN0lWR01EZjIwSFdIQ3JraF9lQTRfVkZlcGNreE5N?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most of us probably don't need telling that &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/eat-30-plants-week-improve-30701080" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;eating a wide variety of fruit and vegetables is good for our health&lt;/a&gt;. The more you can eat over the course of, say, a week, the more nutrients you will be getting into your body and the healthier &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/gut-health-score-93-out-30672961" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;your gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; will be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Similarly, most of us will also have heard a lot about the importance of vitamins to your body's health. But there are many other important nutrients that we hear a lot less about, despite their essential role in how our body functions. One of those is magnesium. So important is it, in fact, that it is involved in more than 300 reactions in the body, registered dietitian Patricia Bannan &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/fruits-with-high-magnesium-rcna202425" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;told Today&lt;/a&gt;. But "despite its importance, about half of US adults don’t get enough magnesium from food", she added. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are simple ways to increase your magnesium intake — and they don't need to involve obscure and expensive foods or supplements. You can get more magnesium from eating the sorts of foods you can come across easily in any supermarket.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why is magnesium important?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Magnesium is a mineral that helps several bodily functions, including:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;turning the food we eat into energy&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; making sure our cells, organs and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9820677/#:~:text=Magnesium%20(Mg)%20is%20involved%20in,of%20the%20blood%E2%80%93brain%20barrier" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;brains are functioning as they should&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;stabilising moods&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;maintaining our muscles&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;aiding vitamin D in travelling around the body&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;making sure the glands which aid bone health work normally.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; It may also play a role in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/9/5/429?ref=circle-magazine-health-wellness-genetics-blog" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;improving symptoms of anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28654669/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;mild depression&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35184264/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;help improve sleep&lt;/a&gt;. There's also evidence that good magnesium levels helps your heart health and one review of evidence found that people with higher intakes of magnesium had an &lt;a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/glossary#meta-analysis" rel="nofollow"&gt;8% lower chance of developing high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; than those with the lowest intakes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;section data-embed-group="read-more" data-embed-items="2" data-ad-dockable="true" data-redesign-embed="true"&gt; &lt;aside class="read-more-links" data-mod="readMoreTweak" data-immediate=""&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What fruit is high in magnesium?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; You can get magnesium in lots of fruits, but topping the list is the &lt;b&gt;passion fruit&lt;/b&gt; , which contains 68 grams of magnesium per cup (a cup is a US measure equivalent to about 250ml in the UK — it's harder to convert that into grams). One &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.00617/full" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;study in the Frontiers in Pharmacology journal&lt;/a&gt; said that "more than 110 phytochemical constituents" have already been found in the plant which shows "a wide range of health effects and biological activities such as antioxidant, anti-hypertensive, anti-tumor, antidiabetic, hypolipidemic activities". &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It adds: "These outstanding results suggest that passion fruit may offer a range of health benefits, such as managing inflammatory and neurological disease, and also preventing some chronic diseases like hypertension and hyperlipidemia."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today.com notes that "the pulp of the aromatic fruit can be eaten raw, as a yogurt topping, or added to juices and drinks" and adds that it "also tops the list of fruits with the most protein".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What other foods are high in magnesium?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are lots of other good sources of magnesium, including:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;leafy green vegetables like spinach or chard&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;nuts and seeds like almonds, chia seeds and pumpkin seeds&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;fruits like guava, banana, papaya, blackberries, kiwi and figs.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rebecca McManamon, consultant dietitian and British Dietetic Association spokesperson, told the &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/bbc"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; that you are probably reaching the recommended daily amount of magnesium if you’re eating unsalted nuts or wholegrains daily, along with a variety of fruit, green vegetables and legumes. She added: "If these are not foods you eat regularly, you may be at a higher risk of not getting enough magnesium." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 11:48:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOY1hsX252UEd5cjVySmpKN0ZIbi15MVdZaTdNT1FDdTIzQlBxYm5jNnRhcTJwMWsydE44WXJBSHBJVmZNSVFwS1M2ZlQwNDBHOS1oZzBWTzdtd3lZd0FmZGVVQWtXRi1mQlFoN0lWR01EZjIwSFdIQ3JraF9lQTRfVkZlcGNreE5N</guid></item><item><title>我是一名顶级医生-您只需要一种补充剂......我花了数年时间将其驳回是错误的-每日邮报 | I'm a top doctor - there's only one supplement you need...and I was wrong to spend years dismissing it - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxQeEFSX21xeWE5WUl4UlhXMDlPUGY3bEZZcHo5VkM3c1ZXd184U0Nqb3JIS3pUdEVUUFVLQW5lb1YxVGgxRjRFV203c1kzZnFHdWhGMkVNcDJaTUMzX1E0UGczMktmdEFlbEo4eGx3MXF2dEFBRkJNOUlKSGJaR3VRSHpxWGFWSUE5S3ZGLTNKSWRRZm_SAZgBQVVfeXFMTTlWYmx0SWs4T1JKVlRxNHVwdFB3ak9xWkZKMjJEZGVtOVVyS3hrdUpGc1hxZkZFQ1dGbUdkSTk4OHJpcTJZSlEwRFFTWDMtTWJIdnd0REQ0eHRvSHhMcGF2NTZnMk8wdU9GNG5ET1E4di1uWWp5WTI5b1VidkZyUWRIYzlJbVQ5azl6TmxhaWEwUDllVDB3dGE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A top &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-dad38410-241a-11f0-a622-2776649f5518" class=""&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; doctor has urged the public to seek an annual blood test to check for vitamin D deficiency — after he was shocked to discover he was severely lacking in the vital nutrient and risking bone problems, despite his healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Karan Rajan, a surgeon working in NHS hospitals, revealed the scare led him to u-turn on his sceptical views on vitamin D supplements, and now recommends them to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Speaking in a video that has so far been &lt;/span&gt;watched over 45,000 times, Dr Rajan warned of the little-known dangers of not getting enough of the nutrient — which include bone deformities, muscle weakness and incorrect growth patterns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is currently estimated that around one in six adults in the UK do not get enough vitamin D. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also known as the 'sunshine vitamin', the main source is exposure to sunlight, as well as from foods like oily fish, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14531051/Jake-Moscato-red-meat-diet-anxiety-cholesterol.html"&gt;red meat&lt;/a&gt; and egg yolks.  &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I was wrong about vitamin D,' Dr Rajan admitted in the clip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'At first I thought only certain people needed it at certain times. At other times I thought it was just a scam.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The truth is, it took me being vitamin D deficient to change my mind.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Rajan listed other vitamins and minerals such as magnesium which help promote the production of useable vitamin D&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;NHS guidelines suggest taking a vitamin D supplement throughout winter, when there is less sunshine, but Dr Rajan wasn't convinced this was necessary until his health scare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I discovered that my vitamin D levels were so low, I had to make a choice. I could have changed my diet and spent more time outdoors which I did, but I wanted to get back to sufficient levels as quickly as possible.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor's vitamin D blood levels were 15.7 ng/ml, making him severely deficient according to the minimum threshold of 20ng/ml, set out by the institute of medicine in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the UK threshold for deficiency is much lower, at 12ng/ml, a level that has long been criticised by international health experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After speaking with experts in the field, Dr Rajan decided to introduce vitamin D supplements to his daily routine, but with a 'twist'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He 'mega-dosed' the supplement, taking 17,000 units for 12 days, before before reducing his intake to 6,000 units for a maintenance dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Four weeks later, Dr Rajan's vitamin D levels had surged to 66.2 ng/ml, proving that taking supplements can help to boost levels of the vitamin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is definitely not what the guidelines suggest but me experimenting on myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Rajan's vitamin D levels were well below the recommended daily guidelines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I learned there are factors you need to take into consideration...but there is no reason why you shouldn't try supplementing with vitamin D for a specific period of time.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Rajan listed the best ways to boost levels of vitamin D, and how to take supplements responsibly to protect against bone fractures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor, who has over 2.16million subscribers, urged anyone over the age of 30 to test regularly to see if they are lacking in any essential vitamins and minerals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'My best advice is test don't guess. At least once a year, get a blood test as a general indicator of health and find out your vitamin D levels too.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added there are many factors you need to take into consideration when it comes to vitamin D supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For instance, the amount of vitamin D people need will depend on a variety of variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Firstly, adequate magnesium is needed for our body to process vitamin D. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without enough of it, the so-called sunshine vitamin cannot be converted into a form the body can absorb. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Before his health scare, Dr Rajan was skeptical about the benefits of taking vitamin D supplements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Vitamin D is fat-soluble, meaning its best taken with foods naturally high in healthy fats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Therefore, those with lower levels of magnesium in their blood may need a higher dose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Secondly, &lt;span&gt;being overweight can also have an impact on how much vitamin D, which is stored in fat cells, can be absorbed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The more fat cells you have, the less vitamin D is available to the rest of the body,' Dr Karan explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Rajan&lt;span&gt; said eating more foods that are naturally high in healthy fats and magnesium—such as nuts, spinach and dark chocolate—will help boost absorption rates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also suggested looking for supplements that contain vitamin K2, which helps to reduce the risk of calcium being deposited in the bloodstream, risking heart disease, which can happen if you take too much generic vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The time of day you take your supplement doesn't seem to be important but consistency is', Dr Rajan added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He suggested taking the supplements for a period of between four and eight weeks before getting another blood test to see if target levels have been achieved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'While supplements can help to boost vitamin D levels, adequate sunlight exposure and a healthy diet that includes things like oily fish, mushrooms and fortified foods are the biggest levers to pull for everyone'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 11:23:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxQeEFSX21xeWE5WUl4UlhXMDlPUGY3bEZZcHo5VkM3c1ZXd184U0Nqb3JIS3pUdEVUUFVLQW5lb1YxVGgxRjRFV203c1kzZnFHdWhGMkVNcDJaTUMzX1E0UGczMktmdEFlbEo4eGx3MXF2dEFBRkJNOUlKSGJaR3VRSHpxWGFWSUE5S3ZGLTNKSWRRZm_SAZgBQVVfeXFMTTlWYmx0SWs4T1JKVlRxNHVwdFB3ak9xWkZKMjJEZGVtOVVyS3hrdUpGc1hxZkZFQ1dGbUdkSTk4OHJpcTJZSlEwRFFTWDMtTWJIdnd0REQ0eHRvSHhMcGF2NTZnMk8wdU9GNG5ET1E4di1uWWp5WTI5b1VidkZyUWRIYzlJbVQ5azl6TmxhaWEwUDllVDB3dGE</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，子宫内膜异位症与免疫疾病有关-英国广播公司 | Endometriosis and immune diseases linked, study shows -

The United States allows nine kinds of phthalates to be used in food packaging. They are an example of what scientists call “&lt;a href="https://www.endocrine.org/topics/edc/what-edcs-are/common-edcs"&gt;endocrine-disrupting chemicals&lt;/a&gt;,” which can tweak and change the hormones in the body, causing multiple health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WUO633LGRJENPCMOUZED77RLYE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We already know that phthalates are toxic chemicals,” said Tracey Woodruff, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive health at the University of California at San Francisco, who was not involved in the study. In recent years, she pointed out, scientists and environmental organizations have pushed lawmakers to get phthalates out of food packaging and other plastics. “This just shows why that’s a good idea,” Woodruff added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="P3ODGJQZHNBCRPL4PVISLD2RV4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kevin Ott, the executive director of the Flexible Vinyl Alliance, which represents the makers of polyvinyl chloride, said in an email that many studies on the health risks of phthalates do not meet the highest standards of evidence. The Food and Drug Administration confirmed as recently as 2018 that phthalates are not clearly linked with any health effects, Ott added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2UREAV46LBGGVNWOZEFELK3HME" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The new study drew on surveys from around the globe that evaluated exposure to food pack, one particular type of phthalate, through urine samples. Researchers then matched exposure to the chemical to increased risk of cardiovascular death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O6ZIJ26ACNHRHKCNIGLCO7HRXY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;They found that phthalates contributed to 13 percent of all deaths from heart disease in people between ages 55 and 64 globally. In the United States, it was around 10 percent. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide: In 2021, an estimated 20 million people died because of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TTECCONT4ZCGHIKFN7EORPSDHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Trasande says that while 13 percent may seem like a high number, phthalate exposure may overlap with and exacerbate other risks. Phthalates are believed to create excess inflammation in the body, and they are linked with other conditions that increase heart disease mortality, such as obesity and high blood pressure. Some of the increased risk of heart disease from obesity, for example, could be from phthalates.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The chemicals are also found more commonly in highly processed foods, another risk factor for death from heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SFMYAPCRKJDQHIDRNVWM2WAYZA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Scientists estimate that air pollution, which contains tiny plastic particles, is linked to 20 percent of all cardiovascular deaths globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZTAY4YH73NCSTA5JSUON3XHZMM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Recent &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; — albeit with a small sample size — has also found that the presence of microplastics or &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/01/08/microplastics-nanoplastics-bottled-water-study/"&gt;nanoplastics &lt;/a&gt;in the carotid artery increases the risk of heart attack, stroke or death. Researchers are trying to understand the extent to which those tiny plastics can carry chemicals like phthalates with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FN6LZ3SQ3ZCSNO7LJSHSEOOUF4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But people with more phthalates in their bodies are probably more exposed to plastics, and therefore to microplastics and nanoplastics as well, Trasande said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Z3GNQSITMVFD5NEQ7APXUB545M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It could be the chemicals that are being delivered, or it could be the micro and nanoplastics,” said Trasande. “And that’s really where the field needs to go scientifically.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IG4247DYFJF55MVISMICOK7TPY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Other research looking at deaths from phthalates has come to similar results. One &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39680769/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published late last year found that phthalates were responsible for about 164,000 deaths worldwide in 2015, most due to heart disease and high blood pressure.

Researchers found that damage to areas connected to emotional and cognitive control regions could either heighten or lessen political involvement, with consistent effects seen across both conservative-leaning and liberal-leaning participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political neuroscience research has long indicated that different brain regions are associated with ideological leanings, but it has remained unclear whether brain anatomy plays a role in how actively people participate in politics. Since participation—rather than mere belief—often drives political outcomes, distinguishing the two could help clarify how cognitive and emotional processes shape public life. In addition, investigating the brain networks involved could eventually inform both clinical assessments and broader questions about human social behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This started out as a collaborative effort focused on learning how to help people better come together and thrive, along with Stephanie Balters at Stanford. We have previously shown that when damaging a brain circuit causes a behavior, therapeutic stimulation to the same circuit may reduce the same behavior,” said study author &lt;a href="https://siddiqi.bwh.harvard.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Shan Siddiqi&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and neuropsychiatrist at the Center for Brain/Mind Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Extending that principle, we went searching for circuits involved in behaviors that might bring people together or drive people apart. We worked with Jordan Grafman at Northwestern, who had collected a profound set of behavioral data after focal brain damage, and he suggested looking at political behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a neuropsychiatrist, I don’t often ask patients about their political behavior, but I realized I didn’t have a good reason for that – as part of our diagnostic assessments, we ask people about all sorts of different personal behaviors. If political behavior can change in neuropsychiatric disorders, then why aren’t we asking about it? In particular, if we can find a brain target that modulates political behavior, we can figure out how to help patients increase or decrease that behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore these questions, the researchers analyzed data from the Vietnam Head Injury Study, focusing on 124 male United States military Veterans who had sustained penetrating head injuries during combat 40 to 45 years earlier. Participants underwent detailed behavioral testing between 2008 and 2012, including surveys that measured how actively they engaged with politics and how they identified ideologically and by party affiliation. A control group of 35 Veterans who had similar combat experiences but no brain injuries was also included for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants answered questions about their political interest, how often they followed political news, and how frequently they discussed political matters. These responses were combined into a single score representing their intensity of political involvement. Separately, participants rated their political ideology on a scale from extremely liberal to extremely conservative, and their party affiliation from strongly Democratic to strongly Republican.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers employed a technique called lesion network mapping, which links damaged brain areas to broader networks of brain connectivity. By analyzing the relationships between each participant’s brain lesion and their political behavior, the team could determine whether certain patterns of brain injury corresponded with changes in political involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings revealed that damage to specific brain circuits was associated with political intensity but not with political ideology or party affiliation. Lesions that disrupted connections to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the posterior precuneus were associated with more intense political involvement. In contrast, lesions that disrupted connections to the amygdala and anterior temporal lobe were associated with reduced political involvement. These effects were seen across participants regardless of whether they leaned conservative or liberal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While most people have not sustained brain injuries akin to those experienced by the veterans in the study, our findings tell us what neural circuits are at play for the population at large,” said senior author Jordan Grafman, professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and director of brain injury research at Shirley Ryan AbilityLab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, political ideology—whether someone leaned left, right, or moderate—did not show a significant link to any specific brain region or network. Neither did party affiliation. This suggests that the brain areas identified are connected to how strongly individuals act on their political beliefs rather than which beliefs they hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We tend to assume that something in your brain affects your political views, but we clearly found no brain circuit that makes you more liberal or more conservative,” Siddiqi told PsyPost. “Political ideology and party affiliation did not change with any identifiable pattern of brain damage. However, regardless of your party affiliation, certain patterns of brain damage might make you more or less likely to express that pre-existing viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that your political preferences might be a behavior that you learn from your environment, while the intensity of political involvement might be encoded in specific brain circuits. We hope that this helps us find common ground – even when people have different political beliefs, they might be more similar than they think.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s results echo &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/new-study-links-brain-network-damage-to-increased-religious-fundamentalism/" target="_blank"&gt;findings from earlier research on religious fundamentalism&lt;/a&gt;. In that work, brain lesions were found to increase rigid, fundamentalist religious beliefs by disrupting a specific brain network, particularly in the right hemisphere. Damage to areas involved in flexible thinking, reasoning, and social judgment appeared to make individuals more prone to absolute and unwavering belief systems. Similarly, in the present study, damage to brain networks involved in cognitive control and emotional regulation was linked to greater or lesser political engagement, depending on the location of the injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both studies suggest that damage to certain networks can influence the style or intensity of belief-related behavior, even if the content of those beliefs—whether religious or political—remains rooted in prior views. Rather than making someone liberal or conservative, brain injuries appear to amplify or suppress how strongly people express and act on their existing opinions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study provides strong evidence linking brain circuitry to political involvement, it has several limitations. All participants were older male veterans, many of whom were more conservative than the general population, which could affect how the findings apply to other groups. The political assessments were also based on participants’ recollections of their beliefs and behaviors before their injuries, which introduces the possibility of memory biases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study was done in military veterans who served in Vietnam,” Siddiqi noted. “In one sense, this was an advantage because it allowed us to control for some variables, ensuring that results weren’t driven by vastly different age groups, professional backgrounds, etc. On the other hand, it means that the results may not fully translate to other populations, so future studies are still needed on this topic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that brain lesions, by nature, are not uniformly distributed across participants, and it is impossible to assess behavior before the injuries occurred. While the study controlled for factors like age, education, and cognitive aptitude, unmeasured variables might still have influenced the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also caution that while lesion network mapping helps reveal associations between brain networks and behavior, it does not establish direct causality. Brain stimulation studies targeting these networks would be needed to test whether manipulating activity in these regions can actually change political involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Current political behavior was compared to a recollection of pre-lesion political behavior,” Siddiqi explained. “That recollection may be inaccurate. We’re now trying to address this by measuring political behavior before and after focal brain stimulation in patients with various psychiatric disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overall, the goal is to identify brain circuits that may be used to help people who seek to modify behaviors that are not classically seen as ‘symptoms’ of a disorder. We are now doing a large-scale study using transcranial magnetic stimulation, a tool that can be used to activate or deactivate specific brain circuits. Participants receive targeted stimulation to different brain circuits to see what kinds of behavioral changes might occur.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are measuring conventional neuropsychiatric symptoms, but also behaviors like altruism, spirituality, political behavior, and other things that are not conventionally seen as symptoms,” Siddiqi said. “We hope to develop a comprehensive atlas of which brain circuits can be targeted to help patients with different kinds of behavioral concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaf101" target="_blank"&gt;Effects of focal brain damage on political behaviour across different political ideologies&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Shan H.

We’re not about to tell you that one specific “superfood” will zap your chances of ever developing cancer, because that’s not true. But what you eat can be a powerful tool for supporting your overall health in ways that may impact your cancer risk, such as by reducing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curious about what an oncologist eats for breakfast every day to bolster their defenses against cancer? We reached out to &lt;a href="https://www.cityofhope.org/tingting-tan" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tingting Tan, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tingting Tan, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, medical oncologist and hematologist at City of Hope in Newport Beach, California. She recommends starting your day with a breakfast loaded with whole grains, fruit and nuts, which have been associated with a lower incidence of various types of cancer.

Some research shows that higher fiber intake is associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer.&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One reason might be that it supports a healthy gut microbiome, which can aid in cancer prevention,” Tan says. For example, a 2021 systematic review in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Nutrition &lt;/em&gt;identified a link between oat consumption and an increase in beneficial gut bacteria.&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a half-cup of whole grain rolled oats contains about 5 grams of fiber, and our Creamy Blueberry-Pecan Oatmeal recipe contains 6 grams of fiber per serving.&lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt; That’s around 21% of the Daily Value for fiber.&lt;strong&gt;17&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Berries&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Foods with phytochemicals, which are compounds found in vegetables, fruit, beans and nuts, may slow cancer cell growth,” Tan says.&lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blueberries are rich in a type of phytochemical called anthocyanin, which helps give the fruit its deep blue color and may reduce inflammation and free radicals.&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt; Plus, research has shown that berries may be associated with a lower risk of cancer.&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Components in berries also have been shown to reduce the growth of precancerous cells,” Tan says.&lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt; This makes these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2051586/best-antioxidant-rich-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:antioxidant powerhouses;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;antioxidant powerhouses&lt;/a&gt; a go-to oatmeal topping, especially given that you can rinse a handful of berries and toss them on top of your oatmeal in less time than it would take to watch a TikTok video.

A 2018 randomized controlled trial, for example, found that walnuts may increase the amount of good bacteria in the gut microbiome.&lt;strong&gt;13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuts are also anti-inflammatory, “and we know that inflammation is associated with developing cancer,” Tan says. Some research has found a strong connection between cancer and chronic inflammation.&lt;strong&gt;14&lt;/strong&gt; To top it all off, nuts are rich in antioxidant-rich compounds like vitamin E, which may help protect the body from cell damage over time.&lt;strong&gt;15,16&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Breakfast Options To Reduce Cancer Risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking for some more breakfast ideas that could reduce inflammation, improve gut health and support your overall health?

Plus, you can make it the night before to eliminate some of the morning rush chaos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For an oncologist-approved breakfast, consider a warm, comforting bowl of oatmeal topped with nuts and berries. It’s loaded with fiber, antioxidants, phytochemicals and other nutrients that may help reduce cancer risk. And it’s tasty enough that you’ll probably want to have it on a regular basis. No breakfast food guarantees protection against cancer, but this nutrient-rich meal may give your overall health a boost in a way that could protect it against some types of cancer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-an-oncologist-has-for-breakfast-11722729" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 09:51:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE9iMWJEM2QxMDgtZFFaYWhvSWJTOTRMMDBLMy1lM01fUWl4SVV1ZkN2dXc4WW5salBoaWtVaElZRlRxQjdCSHdjRmthT2EycDBOQ3B3dmZqR3pZbC1UcFdGWUtWX3YyMklQWkVvdGdybzZjeGs</guid></item><item><title>新的研究发现，喝白葡萄酒和香槟可以降低心脏骤停的风险-独立报 | Drinking white wine and champagne could reduce risk of cardiac arrest, new study finds - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxNb21lcncyWG1LalZsV0dKWUJOYzdPQkxuU25NUVZFNmhjVzJaQlA1elhZRXdfMkhsQ3AzTUxvbU4tLWlnYzV5S3FLdldzT3hjdkxrQ1lmbEk1NjUzcWk0LXVibDhFTlpVcVp6UVp6TnR5bDlla0NtOGxnN0JBMnZsWmRnOExienFEaHFhdGYtU0RMWGxSbXdxa013eWRQSGNzTFc3bG53?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 eWQiqu sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 cGmNxG"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 iqSitv"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 dlmCG"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 igdyzJ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cPkZJS"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 fGzMFb sc-hez36s-16 fJelbS"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 fiXggt"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 eSVQSf"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 cDGSNR"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 kxbAkl"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 kGYWZt"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

Other, more conventional, steps include eating more fruit, maintaining a positive mood, staying a healthy weight and keeping blood pressure under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who were more educated also seemed less prone to cardiac arrest, the study suggested, while poor sleep patterns and a lack of exercise could be detrimental.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 dcuwoN"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/26/16/iStock-1345527456.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/26/16/iStock-1345527456.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/26/16/iStock-1345527456.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Researchers found that a higher consumption of champagne or white wine is just one way to protect against a cardiac arrest" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-18351"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;Researchers found that a higher consumption of champagne or white wine is just one way to protect against a cardiac arrest&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (iStock/Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cardiac arrest is an emergency medical situation that usually happens without warning. People suddenly collapse and are unconscious, and are not breathing or not breathing normally. Without immediate treatment, a person experiencing one is likely to die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK figures suggest there are about 30,000 cardiac arrests a year outside of hospital where emergency medical services attempt to resuscitate a person who has collapsed and stopped breathing normally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest study identified 56 risk factors associated with sudden cardiac arrest and found up to 63 per cent of cases might be avoidable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As expected, lifestyles account for the most burden,” the researchers said, adding: “Public awareness campaigns should be further encouraged to promote lifestyle interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study looked at 502,094 middle-to-older aged people included in the UK Biobank of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of these, 3,147 people suffered sudden cardiac arrest during a typical follow-up period of 13.8 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 56 risk factors identified by researchers including lifestyle factors, socio-economic status, and the local environment, such as exposure to air pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors concluded that between 40 per cent and 63 per cent of sudden cardiac arrest cases may be avoidable when looking at all 56 risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 fdjKtZ"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/26/11/26095750-932c541e-299e-43d6-b475-eef709954b61.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/26/11/26095750-932c541e-299e-43d6-b475-eef709954b61.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/26/11/26095750-932c541e-299e-43d6-b475-eef709954b61.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="“As expected, lifestyles account for the most burden,” the researchers said, adding: “Public awareness campaigns should be further encouraged to promote lifestyle interventions.”" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-18352"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;“As expected, lifestyles account for the most burden,” the researchers said, adding: “Public awareness campaigns should be further encouraged to promote lifestyle interventions.”&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (iStock/PA)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For lifestyle factors, researchers found that a higher consumption of Champagne and/or white wine and fruit intake protected against cardiac arrest, while “fed-up” feelings, high body mass indexes (BMIs) and arm fat mass, high blood pressure, and lower education level all increased the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead investigator and first author, Dr Huihuan Luo, from Fudan University in Shanghai, China, said: “The study found significant associations between various modifiable factors and sudden cardiac arrest, with lifestyle changes being the most impactful in preventing cases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an accompanying editorial, Nicholas Grubic from the University of Toronto, and Dakota Gustafson, from Queen’s University in Ontario, said: “One of the study’s most intriguing findings is the cardioprotective effect associated with Champagne and white wine consumption, questioning long-held assumptions about the specificity of red wine’s cardioprotective properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research on the underlying mechanisms remains unclear, but these findings reinforce the idea that the benefits of moderate alcohol consumption may be more complex than previously assumed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cardiac arrest is caused by a dangerous abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia), which happens when the electrical system in the heart fails to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone witnessing a cardiac arrest is urged to call 999 immediately, start CPR and alert bystanders to get a defibrillator if there is one nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 09:47:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNb21lcncyWG1LalZsV0dKWUJOYzdPQkxuU25NUVZFNmhjVzJaQlA1elhZRXdfMkhsQ3AzTUxvbU4tLWlnYzV5S3FLdldzT3hjdkxrQ1lmbEk1NjUzcWk0LXVibDhFTlpVcVp6UVp6TnR5bDlla0NtOGxnN0JBMnZsWmRnOExienFEaHFhdGYtU0RMWGxSbXdxa013eWRQSGNzTFc3bG53</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，您的狗可能正在改善您的肠道健康-《Outside》杂志 | Research Says Your Dog Is Probably Improving Your Gut Health - Outside Magazine</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY0FVX3lxTE5vMnR3VTZybi10ajNQeHlicG5uSlZDZDhKcU9lX3kxRVZlSjJJVVdoZXM0U3NDV05fSGxRQTh2TzNkQTN4eWxtNWVxUVU1SEhyVHBJLWQxc2hKM2JmaGxSN1F6TQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="o-rich-text js-article-body js-jw-in-article has-dropcap" data-inject-ads="true" data-inject-ads-options="{&amp;quot;markup&amp;quot;:[&amp;quot;&amp;lt;div class='o-ad-wrap'&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class='js-ad js-scroll-load' data-child-zone='in-content-leaderboard-ool' data-size='[\&amp;quot;fluid\&amp;quot;,[300,250],[1,1]]'&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/div&amp;gt;&amp;quot;],&amp;quot;filter&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;nextExceptions&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;img, blockquote, div&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;nextContainsExceptions&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;img, blockquote, a.btn, a.o-button&amp;quot;},&amp;quot;renderIntial&amp;quot;:true,&amp;quot;wordCount&amp;quot;:350}"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;All dog lovers know that those furry friends improve your quality of life. They cheer you up when you’re feeling down, keep you active, and help foster connections with your communities. But did you know that having a pup might also be good for your gut?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to imagine, but research is showing that owning a pet could be beneficial for your gut microbiome, and thus your gastrointestinal health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Clostridium difficile&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;C. difficile,&lt;/i&gt; is usually a hospital-acquired and &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/c-difficile/symptoms-causes/syc-20351691" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0"&gt;infection-causing pathogen&lt;/a&gt; that disrupts healthy bacteria in the colon. The infection, known as &lt;em&gt;C. diff&lt;/em&gt; colitis, tends to occur when patients take antibiotics, which can kill good bacteria in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6346998/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0"&gt;30 percent&lt;/a&gt; of patients initially treated for infections experience a recurrence, and the risk of subsequent recurrence only increases with each case, leading to an unpleasant cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vet.upenn.edu/people/faculty-clinician-search/LAURELREDDING" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0"&gt;Laurel Redding&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, wondered if these recurrent cases might come from the animals we share our environment with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The idea going in was, if you get &lt;i&gt;C. difficile&lt;/i&gt; from the hospital, you come home, you shed it, your pet would pick it up, your pet would become colonized, then your pet would give it back to you, and you would become infected again,” Redding says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But her team found quite the opposite. Their &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6969483/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0"&gt;2020 study&lt;/a&gt; explained that close interactions with pets actually appeared to have a &lt;em&gt;protective effect&lt;/em&gt; against the recurrence of C.&lt;i&gt; difficile&lt;/i&gt; infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Living with Pets May Strengthen Your Immune System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other researchers have observed similar phenomena. A &lt;a href="https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565(24)00450-6/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; found that children between the ages of 5 and 15 who lived with a dog had a reduced risk of developing Crohn’s disease, a bowel disease that causes inflammation of the intestinal lining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4805472/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0"&gt;2016 study&lt;/a&gt; found that exposure to dogs led to a decrease in childhood asthma cases in farming communities. Research also found that&lt;span&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9728917/#:~:text=Conclusion,validated%20in%20a%20larger%20cohort." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0"&gt;in seniors&lt;/a&gt; (people over 65), there was an increase in beneficial microorganisms and a decrease in&lt;/span&gt; harmful bacteria in the guts of dog owners. Findings in another &lt;a href="https://www.elsevier.es/en-revista-allergologia-et-immunopathologia-105-articulo-exposure-dogs-but-not-cats-S0301054618300041" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; suggested that exposure to pet dogs (and not cats, interestingly enough) decreased the prevalence of atopic dermatitis, also known as eczema, in children, especially when the dogs remained indoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People who grew up around animals, or had furred pets, or grew up on farms tend to have lower incidences of autoimmune diseases like asthma or &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK542187/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0"&gt;atopy&lt;/a&gt; (which describes someone who is highly susceptible to allergen-related diseases), and even obesity,” says Redding. She explains that a lot of these diseases are tied to the health of the microbiota, the community of organisms that live on and in our bodies, primarily in the gut, which is home to roughly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3426293/#:~:text=The%20human%20microbiota%20consists%20of,as%20the%2016S%20rRNA%20gene." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0"&gt;100 trillion bacteria&lt;/a&gt;—hence the focus on gut health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pets and Owners Share Microbes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning as early as the 1980s, researchers have found that pets and their owners share microorganisms. &lt;span&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3862654" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0"&gt;1984 study&lt;/a&gt; specifically looked at intestinal &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;and found that humans and their pets shared similar strains of the bacteria.&lt;/span&gt; More recent studies, however, analyze whole communities of microorganisms. One &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3628085/#:~:text=Song%20et%20al.,on%20the%20skin%20and%20tongue" data-afl-p="0"&gt;2013 study&lt;/a&gt; found that people and dogs who cohabitated shared similar microbial communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="has-fade fade-up" data-animation=""&gt;&lt;blockquote class="has-pullquote pullquote-fill"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children who live in households with pets have higher gut diversity than those who don’t reside with pets, and the thought is that a more diverse microbiome is a healthier microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Redding, “Up until recently, the majority of the research looking into microbes from pets has been more on the pathogen side where we question: What are the bad things that animals transmit to us?” But researchers are starting to understand that microbial sharing might have benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Dogs Benefit Your Gut Health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason &lt;i&gt;why &lt;/i&gt;there are fewer instances of allergies or autoimmune diseases in farming communities or households with animals remains unclear. But many researchers believe it is linked to the hygiene hypothesis: the idea that young children in clean, modern environments are not exposed to an adequate amount of microbes, resulting in understimulated immune systems (and making them more likely to develop allergies and auto-immune diseases). Dogs may help with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Increased Diversity of the Gut Microbiome&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Children who live in households with pets have higher gut diversity than those who don’t reside with pets, and the thought is that a more diverse microbiome is a healthier microbiome,” says &lt;a href="https://physicians.wustl.edu/people/lori-r-holtz-md/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0"&gt;Dr. Lori Holtz&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatric gastroenterologist at St. Louis Children’s Hospital and member of the American Gastrointestinal Association. “The thought is that dogs go outside and bring those microbes in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;You May Be Better Protected from Disease&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Redding’s 2020 study, researchers found that more contact came with greater benefits. “The more contact you have with your pet, the more you share sleeping quarters with it or let the dog lick your hand or face, the greater the protective effects against &lt;em&gt;C. difficile&lt;/em&gt; infection recurrence,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry: you don’t necessarily need to change your behavior around your pets to reap the benefits. “Generally, I think with people who own pets, there’s a lot of close contact, so that kind of exchange is just happening already,” says Holtz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Studies Are Needed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most &lt;span&gt;studies on the beneficial impacts of pet ownership on the microbiome have been conducted with young children and babies, a time when the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966842X19302148" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0"&gt;microbiome&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;/span&gt;most malleable. But Redding is currently studying adults to see whether older pet owners have less severely disrupted microbiomes after taking antibiotics and if their microbiomes recover more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone has a baseline microbiome that’s healthy enough, but when something like an antibiotic comes along and disrupts it, then it will be interesting to see what effects our pets might have, if any,” says Redding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;We Don’t Know How Many “Bad” Germs Our Pets Share with Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While studies around microbial sharing are promising, experts note that more research is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We still do have to weigh the possibility that they are sharing unhealthy microbes with us, like &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/campylobacter/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0"&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/a&gt; (a bacterium that causes diarrhea) or Salmonella or &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;,” says Redding. “So where that trade-off happens, good bacteria versus bad bacteria, I don’t think we know at this point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between eating fermented foods, managing stress, getting enough sleep, and following all of the other gut health tips out there, keeping your microbiome strong can seem like a daunting task. But luckily, the gut-healthy practice of snuggling up with your pup is easy to incorporate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A study published last week in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Medical Entomology&lt;/em&gt; documents human cases of the tickborne disease, Babesiosis, the presence of the parasite that causes the disease in local tick populations, and a growing public health threat for the Mid-Atlantic Region.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was submitted by a retired federal public health worker who lives on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. Twenty-one of her colleagues joined her in the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The findings underscore the need for increased surveillance, public awareness, and preventive measures against tick-borne diseases in the … region,” said Ellen Stromdahl, of Harborton. “Healthcare providers should consider babesiosis in the differential diagnosis for patients (having or showing symptoms of a fever) … particularly during peak tick activity seasons.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;April is generally considered the start of tick season. However, local residents have been known to find ticks in the winter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The journal is a peer-reviewed publication dedicated to advancing research on insects, ticks, and other arthropods of medical and veterinary importance. It provides critical insights into vector-borne diseases, parasite ecology, and public health implications worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Let us get the word out about babesiosis so we can help save lives,” the lead author wrote in an email over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Babesiosis is a disease caused by parasites transmitted to one’s red blood cells. Symptoms can include flu-like illness, hemolytic anemia, and, in severe cases, complications like organ failure or death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tick-borne illnesses can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Some common examples include Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, ehrlichiosis, and anaplasmosis. Other less common but still significant tick-borne illnesses include babesiosis, tularemia, and Powassan virus disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study confirms that babesiosis, historically concentrated in the Northeast and Upper Midwest, is now expanding. The research highlights an increasing number of locally acquired human cases. Cases were reported in Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. It was detected in ticks in those regions and Delaware.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;      Babesiosis can be severe in the elderly or immunocompromised, especially when patients have concurrent infections with the pathogenic spirochete responsible for Lyme disease. Diagnosis can be difficult, as the disease is rare. Babesiosis might be misdiagnosed or treated empirically with antibiotics typically prescribed for Lyme disease or anaplasmosis, such as doxycycline. However, antibiotics alone are not effective against babesiosis, making early and accurate diagnosis crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

On April 27, the Chihuahua Health Secretariat pushed the state’s number of confirmed cases even higher, to 713. In comparison, the Pan American Health Organization reported &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/2025-03/2025-feb-28-phe-epialert-measles-eng-final.pdf" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/2025-03/2025-feb-28-phe-epialert-measles-eng-final.pdf"}' href="https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/2025-03/2025-feb-28-phe-epialert-measles-eng-final.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;only 7 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; in the whole of Mexico in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The outbreak in Chihuahua is partly due to its proximity to Texas, which it borders to the north. A major outbreak has been &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/measles-cases-rise-texas/"&gt;ongoing in the US state since late January&lt;/a&gt;, and cases in Mexico have been &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON561"&gt;linked to those north of the border&lt;/a&gt;. The United States has recorded &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;884&lt;/a&gt; confirmed cases of measles this year, up from 285 in 2024, as well as three deaths from the disease. Of this year’s cases in the US, 646 have been in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;To try to prevent the measles virus from spreading further throughout Mexico, its Ministry of Health has issued a &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/992760/APV-EEUU-EEUU-CANADA-Sarampion_20250425_english.pdf" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/992760/APV-EEUU-EEUU-CANADA-Sarampion_20250425_english.pdf"}' href="https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/992760/APV-EEUU-EEUU-CANADA-Sarampion_20250425_english.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;travel warning&lt;/a&gt; for the United States and Canada, where cases have also risen sharply. The ministry advises travelers to make sure they are up-to-date with their vaccinations, practice social distancing, wear a mask, and frequently wash their hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Falling vaccination levels have also helped drive up Mexico’s cases, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/measles-cases-are-rising-other-diseases-could-follow/"&gt;as they have in the US&lt;/a&gt;. In 98 percent of US cases this year, the patient—whether an adult or child—had no history of vaccination against measles. In early April, it was reported that a 31-year-old man unvaccinated against measles had died of the disease in Chihuahua.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Because measles is highly contagious, very high rates of vaccination against it—95 percent—are needed across communities to stop the virus from spreading. But rates of vaccination in Mexico have been faltering. Children are supposed to receive two doses of the measles vaccine, the first typically between 12 and 15 months, and the second within the next few years. According to the WHO, in 2023 &lt;a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.IMM.MEAS?locations=MX"&gt;only 76 percent&lt;/a&gt; of children under 2 years old in Mexico had received a measles vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;If rates don’t improve, this could allow the disease to become endemic again in North America. According to an &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/scientists-say-measles-likely-to-become-endemic-in-us-polio-diphtheria-rubella/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; by Stanford University epidemiologists, at current state-level vaccination rates in the US, measles could reestablish itself and be steadily present in the country over the next two decades. This would result in the deaths of 2,500 people over the next 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In response to the urgent need to reverse Mexico’s decreasing vaccination coverage, the Ministry of Health has launched a National Vaccination Week, the country’s first nationwide immunization campaign since the Covid-19 pandemic. From April 26 to May 3, the plan is to boost vaccine levels in the group most vulnerable to measles: children from 1 to 9 years of age. The ministry hopes to inoculate 1.8 million children to bring them up-to-date with their shots, by offering vaccines free of charge at hospitals, clinics, schools, and health centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Measles isn’t the only disease being targeted in Mexico: Children over 4 years old are also being offered the DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus) vaccine, and a pneumococcal booster is being offered at 12 months of age. Adolescents, adults over 60, and pregnant women are also being invited to get specific vaccines that they might need as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Measles is a &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/this-is-how-measles-can-kill-texas-new-mexico-outbreak-vaccines-vitamin-a/"&gt;viral disease&lt;/a&gt;, and it is considered to be one of the most contagious in the world. It mostly spreads among children. It is transmitted by contact with infected nasal or pharyngeal secretions and through the air, and it initially affects the respiratory tract. Symptoms include a high fever, cough, abundant nasal discharges, and a skin rash that spreads all over the body. Complications can include blindness, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), diarrhea, dehydration, ear infections, and pneumonia. In severe cases, it can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://es.wired.com/articulos/ante-brote-de-sarampion-en-mexico-emiten-alerta-de-viaje-a-ee-uu-y-lanzan-semana-nacional-de-vacunacion"&gt;WIRED &lt;em&gt;en Español&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;and has been translated from Spanish.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPemVWTmRVTDluMG9ZNXJ6Mkx0RlRnOFNob0kzTUpVUnZSSWwyd1NzVzl6QzhxZGVwZnBzb19vQU5WYUEzYlYzbDlfY2kydzh6M19PQzdJdmYzbEc4cU02UDYxTUVDLWxjQ1hwUnRuTnpiWGx6YXBpVUVmVHZVNU9uY1c3cmYyUGFqSnlj</guid></item><item><title>普拉提教练建议您在睡觉前进行这五步动作，以获得深度睡眠- Fit&amp;Well | A Pilates instructor says you should do this five-move routine before bed for deep sleep - Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizAFBVV95cUxNZ3NtRFRucjZzdmJVMVJCbFU2bFlHNTJLOTRmamVBMl9Na1BXOTl5TnFkMnhrUUFGM0gyc0xraVlBS1N1OTVfcGRCaDBYa3lWMlJJNUJrOTBTbWVKUGhCRzlJMmJSZlE1TFZReGZmTmc3NDZUUjl4TGh1UDV3MVJwNGJicmhBVmphUV9EakZBQ1J4cldHRlNNdS00R0k1VUQzOTVpVVpPTWNmd0llUlNLaU9JeE1CQVhSbGNFQ1FFbzVGN0lmWndaWE1Ha3E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Champagne and white wine “protect” the heart from cardiac arrest, new research has suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts found that drinking wine, eating more fruit and keeping slim were all linked to a lower risk of a sudden cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 30,000 Britons each year suffer an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (which is different from a heart attack). This occurs when the heart suddenly stops beating, and emergency resuscitation is required to start it again. Researchers said thousands of people could prevent it by tackling health and lifestyle issues, as they identified 56 risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But an “intriguing” finding of the research was that champagne and white wine seemed to produce a “protective effect” on the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by Fudan University in Shanghai, China, found that a &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/alcohol/is-white-wine-healthier-than-we-think/"&gt;higher consumption of white wine&lt;/a&gt;, more fruit, a consistent positive mood, maintaining a healthy weight and keeping blood pressure under control all seemed to protect against a cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who were more educated also seemed less prone to cardiac arrest, the study, published in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology, suggested. Poor sleep patterns and a lack of exercise could be detrimental.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;No ‘fed-up feelings’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study identified 56 risk factors associated with sudden cardiac arrest and found up to 63 per cent of cases might be avoidable if people changed unhealthy habits. It looked at 502,094 middle-aged to older people included in the UK Biobank’s data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of these, 3,147 people suffered sudden cardiac arrest during an average follow-up period of 13.8 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors concluded that between 40 per cent and 63 per cent of sudden cardiac arrest cases may be avoidable when looking at all 56 risk factors, which included lifestyle factors, socio-economic status, and the local environment, such as exposure to air pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For lifestyle factors, researchers found that a higher consumption of champagne and/or white wine and fruit intake protected against cardiac arrest, while “fed-up” feelings, high body mass indexes (BMIs) and arm fat mass, high blood pressure, and lower education level all increased the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It found that the risk for regular champagne and white wine drinkers was about 30 per cent lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Huihuan Luo, the lead investigator from Fudan University, said: “The study found significant associations between various modifiable factors and sudden cardiac arrest, with lifestyle changes being the most impactful in preventing cases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;‘More complex than previously assumed’ &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an accompanying editorial, Nicholas Grubic, from the University of Toronto, and Dakota Gustafson, from Queen’s University in Ontario, said: “One of the study’s most intriguing findings is the cardioprotective effect associated with champagne and white wine consumption, questioning long-held assumptions about the specificity of red wine’s cardioprotective properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research on the underlying mechanisms remains unclear, but these findings reinforce the idea that the benefits of moderate alcohol consumption may be more complex than previously assumed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has found that the polyphenols found in wine, which have typically been associated with red wine, can play a role in &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/alcohol/is-red-wine-good-for-you"&gt;lowering blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and reducing the risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These antioxidants can be found in all types of wine but are lower in white varieties. Despite this, the research suggests they may help to protect the body’s heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts believe the antioxidants found in alcoholic drinks can help to protect the heart and other body cells as well as the brain, with some researchers suggesting it can ward off dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the research, which found a link rather than cause, has not taken into account the other potential harms that alcohol can cause or whether there is a net benefit to having a glass of wine.&lt;/p&gt;

Right now, doctors rely on brain scans called PET scans to find amyloid plaques or do a spinal tap to check for abnormal levels of proteins like beta-amyloid and tau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;These tests are expensive, invasive and not always easy to access. Blood tests could make it much simpler to find early signs of the disease and be more widely available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"If you get a diagnosis early, you're actually able to access treatments that you cannot take later on in the disease process," &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.alz.org/press/spokespeople/elizabeth-edgerly" target="_blank"&gt;Elizabeth Edgerly&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, a clinical psychologist and Alzheimer's Association spokesperson, said in an interview with ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The report highlights that diagnosing Alzheimer's earlier could open the door to treatments when they have the best chance of working, helping people stay mentally sharper for longer and giving families more time to plan for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In the past two years, the FDA has approved two new drugs -- Leqembi and Kisunla -- that can slow the progression of early Alzheimer's. While they are not cures, they can help people preserve memory and thinking skills longer, offering more time with a better quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This marks a major shift from older Alzheimer's treatments, which could only manage symptoms without slowing down the disease much. However, these new drugs carry significant challenges, including high costs, the need for frequent brain scans to monitor serious side effects and the risk of swelling or bleeding in the brain. In addition, only people in the early stages of Alzheimer's are eligible to receive these treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Ultimately, we would love to see an array of treatments that are available that tackle different aspects of Alzheimer's, different factors that are contributing to it," Edgerly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;She noted that more than 140 different treatments are now in development, aiming to target different symptoms and stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The report also lays out an updated understanding of Alzheimer's risk factors, dividing them into two categories. Some risks -- like age, genetics and family history -- cannot be changed. Others -- including diet, exercise, blood pressure, cholesterol, hearing and vision health -- are within a person's control. Addressing the modifiable risks can have a significant impact on a person's Alzheimer's risk, the report noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In fact, Edgerly said that nearly half of all dementias could be preventable by taking better care of modifiable risks earlier in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;A nurse holds the hands of a person suffering from Alzheimer's disease on September 21, 2009 at Les Fontaines retirement home in Lutterbach , eastern France.

My last A1C test showed a value of 7.8%. I have been taking Mounjaro weekly, which lowered my weight by about 20 pounds and my A1C level by about 0.5%. I also take diltiazem for hypertension, a statin, and one metformin pill per day. I read an article in the newspaper stating that according to experts, an A1C of over 7% may be appropriate for "older people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;My question is, what is the definition of "older people"? Is it over 65 or even older? I am wondering if I still need to be overly concerned about my A1C reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— A.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear A.:&lt;/strong&gt; Although there are no clear studies to inform us of the ideal blood sugar control (the A1C is a measurement of your overall blood sugar during the past few months), expert groups try to balance the potential benefits of keeping sugar levels near normal (with its reduced risk of small blood vessel disease that can lead to kidney and nerve damage over time) against the potential harms from very tight blood sugar control (with its risk of dangerously low blood sugars).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Unfortunately, the term "older people" doesn't really help here. The critical issue is whether a person is in sufficiently good health to realize the benefits of good blood pressure control. An otherwise healthy 71-year-old absolutely has a life expectancy that makes blood sugar control important, which means an A1C level of 7.0% to 7.5% might be ideal. For older people with multiple medical issues, an A1C of 8% might be reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Studies like the ACCORD trial, which showed that a very low A1C goal of 6% led to worse outcomes than an A1C goal of 7% in people at a high risk for heart disease, were done at a time when the medicines we had were not always good for the heart. The Mounjaro you are taking reduces the risk of heart disease, and future studies may show that this class of medicines, along with others like the SGLT2 inhibitors, may completely change our understanding of blood glucose control and heart disease. It may be that in the future, "tighter" control of blood sugar may lead to better long-term outcomes, but it will take large trials to help sort this out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; I have had a sore tongue for a month. I visited a doctor and got some ointment and mouthwash, but it hasn't cured it. What other steps should I take?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— G.W.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear G.W.:&lt;/strong&gt; If you haven't already, your first visit should be to a dentist who can do a comprehensive exam to look for other causes of tongue and mouth pain. Aphthous ulcers ("canker sores"), herpes virus ("cold sores"), dry mouth, allergic reactions and nutritional deficiencies are all possibilities. There are dermatologic diseases like a geographic tongue that can cause mouth or tongue pain. Fungal infections may also be the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Nerve diseases such as glossopharyngeal neuralgia and burning mouth syndrome could also cause symptoms. If your dentist and general physician haven't been able to help, a visit with a neurologist may be of benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I have had several patients become sensitive to sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), which is an ingredient in many toothpastes. Occasionally, simply switching to an SLS-free toothpaste solves the problem. &lt;em&gt;Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 04:04:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizwFBVV95cUxNZWkwYVVGWGVGWU1fcS03aE43ZzhlMXJyeHJ0OVlsZG5vY2FmaDVMbjBnQ1BWVHA4ZlV3eTFzajBkRjJlbkp4cHVyekNOM00tQ1lNWnl4ZURVRHZXcTZ1clZrYXN1cGN3ZFVFRW8waHl1MU52N1ZwMGNhdDFkWGc0dzVtVHp4cF9nQlRzQ3Brb1VaM1RNemdXeDV4VWYtWVlQM0U2Sm5DOWltUDJfTldjWnVnTFVabVBCcksxNllIZWhrZWdmM3pnVXprNG5VdXc</guid></item><item><title>世界各地的心脏病死亡与塑料中广泛使用的化学物质有关- Medical Xpress | Heart disease deaths worldwide linked to chemical widely used in plastics - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPWi1PNlpIQXp3R3VTbDJXaXRsZHNiTWtIQldseG9Ud3RQWXhnaHloWGx0ZjVWUFA3WlE2blk5ZHpMenk5OFZ3ZU9SX2ZlcEpjbC1rLVpaRS1fdUJUMFVzNHFSTFpvZTdkLUstYTFWRzVLZHEtUGNNbE5SUF9jOFZjZVJQOGE0aW93?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily exposure to certain chemicals used to make plastic household items could be linked to more than 365,000 global deaths from heart disease in 2018 alone, a new analysis of population surveys shows.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;While the chemicals, called phthalates, are in widespread use globally, Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East populations bore a much larger share of the death toll than others—about half the total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, experts have connected health problems to exposure to certain phthalates found in cosmetics, detergents, solvents, plastic pipes, bug repellents, and other products. When these chemicals break down into microscopic particles and are ingested, studies have linked them to an increased risk of conditions ranging from obesity and diabetes to fertility issues and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by researchers at NYU Langone Health, the current study focused on a kind of phthalate called di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), which is used to make food containers, medical equipment, and other plastic softer and more flexible. Exposure has been shown in other studies to prompt an overactive immune response (inflammation) in the heart's arteries, which, over time, is associated with an increased risk of heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their new analysis, the authors estimated that DEHP exposure contributed to 368,764 deaths, or more than 10% of all global mortality from &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/heart+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 among men and women aged 55 through 64. A report on the findings is published in the journal &lt;i&gt;eBioMedicine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By highlighting the connection between phthalates and a leading cause of death across the world, our findings add to the vast body of evidence that these chemicals present a tremendous danger to human health," said study lead author Sara Hyman, BS, an associate research scientist at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;According to the authors, the resulting economic burden from the deaths identified in their study was estimated to be around $510 billion and may have reached as high as $3.74 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a past study from 2021, the research team tied phthalates to more than 50,000 premature deaths each year, mostly from heart disease, among older Americans. Their latest investigation is believed to be the first global estimate to date of cardiovascular mortality—or indeed any health outcome—resulting from exposure to the chemicals, says Hyman, who is also a graduate student at NYU School of Public Global Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the research, the team used health and environmental data from dozens of population surveys to estimate DEHP exposure across 200 countries and territories. The information included urine samples containing chemical breakdown products left by the plastic additive. Mortality data was obtained from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, a research group in the US that collects medical information worldwide to identify trends in public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the key findings, the study showed that losses in Africa and in the combined region of East Asia and the Middle East accounted, respectively, for 30% and 25% of the mortality from heart disease linked to DEHP. Specifically, India had the highest death count at 39,677 deaths, followed by Pakistan and Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The larger heart death risks in these populations held true even after the researchers adjusted their statistical analysis to take into account population size within the studied age group.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;A possible explanation, the authors say, is that these countries face higher rates of exposure to the chemicals, possibly because they are undergoing a boom in plastic production but with fewer manufacturing restrictions than other regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There is a clear disparity in which parts of the world bear the brunt of heightened heart risks from phthalates," said study senior author Leonardo Trasande, MD, MPP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our results underscore the urgent need for global regulations to reduce exposure to these toxins, especially in areas most affected by rapid industrialization and plastic consumption," added Trasande, the Jim G. Hendrick, MD, Professor of Pediatrics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trasande, who is also a professor in the Department of Population Health, cautions that the analysis was not designed to establish that DEHP directly or alone caused heart disease and that higher death risks did not take into account other types of phthalates. Nor did it include mortality among those in other age groups. As a result, the overall death toll from heart disease connected to these chemicals is likely much higher, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trasande says that the researchers next plan to track how reductions in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/phthalate/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;phthalate&lt;/a&gt; exposure may, over time, affect global mortality rates, as well as to expand the study to other health concerns posed by the chemicals, such as preterm birth. Trasande also serves as director of NYU Grossman School of Medicine's Division of Environmental Pediatrics and the Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards.&lt;/p&gt;

            Synthetic chemicals called phthalates, found in consumer products such as food storage containers, shampoo, makeup, perfume and children’s toys, may have contributed to more than 10% of all global mortality from heart disease in 2018 among men and women ages 55 through 64, a new study found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000e3b6mzf1pjf4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Phthalates contribute to inflammation and systemic inflammation in the coronary arteries, which can accelerate existing disease and lead to acute events including mortality,” said senior author Dr. Leonardo Trasande, a professor of pediatrics and population health at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine. He also is director of NYU Langone’s Division of Environmental Pediatrics and Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Phthalates are known to disrupt testosterone,” Trasande said, adding that in men, “low testosterone is a predictor of adult cardiovascular disease.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000g3b6m03ieospc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Phthalates have been linked in earlier studies with &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.2478/s13382-011-0022-2" target="_blank"&gt;reproductive problems&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27567446/" target="_blank"&gt;genital malformations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1280383/" target="_blank"&gt;undescended testes &lt;/a&gt;in baby boys and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27546318/#:~:text=The%20general%20exposure%20to%20endocrine,malformations%20of%20the%20genital%20tract." target="_blank"&gt;lower sperm counts&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7067547/" target="_blank"&gt; testosterone levels &lt;/a&gt;in adult males. Studies have also linked phthalates to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1247566/" target="_blank"&gt;asthma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3385443/" target="_blank"&gt;childhood obesity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0273230099912965" target="_blank"&gt;cancer.&lt;/a&gt;

            “The new study underscores the potentially enormous health and economic burden of DEHP exposure, which aligns with existing concerns about its risks,” said David Andrews, acting chief science officer at the Environmental Working Group, a consumer organization that monitors exposure to phthalates and other chemicals in plastics, in an email. He was not involved with the study.

            The American Chemistry Council, which represents industry, declined to comment on the study but told CNN via email that the organization’s &lt;a href="https://www.americanchemistry.com/industry-groups/high-phthalates" target="_blank"&gt;High Phthalates Panel&lt;/a&gt; is dedicated to promoting the benefits of high phthalates such as DINP and DIDP.

    &lt;/p&gt;

            Other common exposures come from the use of phthalates in food packaging, detergents, clothing, furniture and automotive plastics. &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetic-ingredients/phthalates-cosmetics" target="_blank"&gt;Phthalates&lt;/a&gt; are also added to personal care items such as shampoo, soap, hair spray and cosmetics to make fragrances last longer.&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/30/health/shopping-toxic-chemicals-wellness/index.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

            People are exposed when they breathe contaminated air or eat or drink foods that come into contact with the plastic, according to the &lt;a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/ToxFAQs/ToxFAQsDetails.aspx?faqid=377&amp;amp;toxid=65" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.

            The new study, &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2025.105730" target="_blank"&gt;published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal eBiomedicine, examined the impact of one phthalate — &lt;a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/ToxFAQs/ToxFAQsDetails.aspx?faqid=377&amp;amp;toxid=65" target="_blank"&gt;Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate&lt;/a&gt;, or DEHP — on global deaths across 200 countries and territories.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000n3b6m610vnucu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers analyzed health and environmental data from dozens of population surveys, which included urine samples containing chemical breakdown products left by DEHP, which is known to be connected to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7570088/#:~:text=The%20authors%20found%20a%20positive,subclinical%20atherosclerosis%2C%20enhancing%20the%20risk" target="_blank"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, Trasande said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000o3b6mqoh2ib40@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate has also been linked to birth defects, cancer and reproductive harm for men, according to California’s &lt;a href="https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/di2-ethylhexylphthalate-dehp" target="_blank"&gt;Proposition 65&lt;/a&gt;, a law that requires companies to place warning labels on products notifying consumers about chemicals’ possible health effects.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000p3b6mdnfg65k6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers compared the exposure with death statistics collected by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, a US research group that gathers global medical information.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000q3b6mrvx58kr5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The analysis found exposure to DEHP contributed to 368,764 deaths in 2018 among men and women ages 55 through 64 globally. Africa accounted for 30% of the deaths from heart disease linked to DEHP, while East Asia and the Middle East accounted for 25% of the mortality, the study found.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000r3b6mm1bfdioa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The research is believed to be the first global estimate of any health outcome from exposure to the DEHP, said lead study author Sara Hyman, an associate research scientist at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000s3b6mv63u81ug@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “By highlighting the connection between phthalates and a leading cause of death across the world, our findings add to the vast body of evidence that these chemicals present a tremendous danger to human health,” Hyman said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000t3b6mllcyynix@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A limitation of the research, however, stems from the use of hazard ratios the US to estimate population-attributable deaths in other countries, EWG’s Andrews said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000u3b6m0fj7a2zw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While the authors acknowledge this limitation, it assumes that the relationship between DEHP exposure and cardiovascular disease is consistent globally,” he said in an email. “This may not hold true given significant differences in both exposure levels and access to CVD detection and treatment across countries.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/12/health/plastic-chemical-early-death-wellness/index.html"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; by Trasande and his team measured the urine concentration of phthalates in more than 5,000 adults in the United States and compared those levels with the risk of early death over an average of 10 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000w3b6mhoxmte59@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0269749121016031?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers found phthalates may contribute to some 91,000 to 107,000 premature deaths a year among Americans ages 55 to 64&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;People with the highest levels of phthalates had a greater risk of death from any cause, especially cardiovascular mortality, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The results held even after researchers controlled for preexisting heart disease, diabetes, cancer and other common conditions, poor eating habits, physical activity and body mass, and levels of other known &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/17/health/bpa-bisphenol-a-plastics-canned-foods-death-wellness/index.html"&gt;hormone disruptors such as bisphenol A or BPA&lt;/a&gt;.

            Researchers estimated those deaths could cost the United States about $40 billion to $47 billion each year in lost economic productivity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            It is possible to minimize your exposure to phthalates and other endocrine disruptors, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc00103b6m15pm0pdc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Avoid plastics as much as you can. Reducing your use of ultraprocessed foods can reduce the levels of the chemical exposures you come in contact with,” Trasande said. “Never put plastic containers in the microwave or dishwasher, where the heat can break down the linings so they might be absorbed more readily.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            ·       Buy fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables instead of canned and processed versions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            ·       Avoid air fresheners and all plastics labeled as No. 3, No. 6 and No. 7.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

The mass was likely hidden among dense breast tissue, since both appear white on the scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I asked to see her mammograms, and actually, her mammograms for the last five years read that she had extremely dense breasts, and she was never notified," Hallowell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/21/PDTN/83199236007-20250421-rbmecancerscreening-037.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=437&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/21/PDTN/83199236007-20250421-rbmecancerscreening-037.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=874&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Radiology vice chair Dr. David Pinkney, left, looks on as breast imaging division head Dr. Gurpriya Gupta talks about an MRI on the right and mammography on the left in the reading room at Henry Ford Radiology &amp;amp; Imaging in Detroit on April 21."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Radiology vice chair Dr. David Pinkney, left, looks on as breast imaging division head Dr. Gurpriya Gupta talks about an MRI on the right and mammography on the left in the reading room at Henry Ford Radiology &amp;amp; Imaging in Detroit on April 21." data-c-credit="Robin Buckson, The Detroit News"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/leo/bureaus-agencies/miosha/divisions/technical-services-division/rad-safety/mammography/breast-density-patient-notification-requirement" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Michigan law has required&lt;/a&gt; facilities to inform patients about breast density in a letter since 2015, the Food and Drug Administration updated its policies and made this the national standard last fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;And yet, insurers in Michigan vary as far as who covers additional screenings for women with dense breast tissue. Blue Cross Blue Shield, Michigan's largest insurer with over 5 million members across all 50 states, covers 3D mammography or 2D mammography starting at age 40, as well as additional imaging for tactile abnormalities or abnormal mammograms, but is now reviewing its policies after the National Comprehensive Cancer Network released new guidance for patients with extremely dense breasts earlier this spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"This guidance recommends patients with normal results from a mammogram receive a screening breast MRI with and without contrast beginning at age 50," Blue Cross Blue Shield said in a statement. "This new guidance is currently being reviewed by our medical policy team."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Michigan Medicaid, which provides coverage to low-income residents, also only covers mammograms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Thirty-six states have insurance laws on the books for coverage of 3D or supplemental screenings for breast cancer based on risk factors like breast density, according to &lt;a href="https://densebreast-info.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DBI-INSURANCE-TABLE032625.pdf" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Dense Breast Info&lt;/a&gt;, an educational nonprofit based in New York, but Michigan is not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Advocates say uneven coverage is a barrier for women with dense breasts, and many can't afford to pay out of pocket for additional screenings beyond a mammogram. There's also a lack of education about dense breast tissues among some patients, which is another obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"The more information a patient has, the more they can advocate for themselves and make clear, informed decisions when it comes to health care," said Gretchen Awad, executive director of the Susan G. Komen breast cancer organization in northwest Ohio and Michigan. "But the letter of information about breast density is only really one step. The next step would be ... the equal and equitable mammogram policies in each state."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When physicians read mammograms, breast density falls within four categories: almost entirely fatty, scattered fibroglandular elements, heterogeneously dense, and extremely dense, said Dr. Sabala Mandava, Chair of Radiology at Henry Ford Health. Heterogeneously dense tissue refers to tissue that is mostly dense but also has some areas of fatty tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When physicians talk about dense breast tissue, they are typically referring to the latter two categories, heterogeneously dense and extremely dense, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"If you have dense breast tissue ... it's one of the risk factors for breast cancer, so you will have an increased risk," Mandava said. "Because the tissue is dense, it's harder to see through."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;On a mammogram, dense tissue appears white and fat appears black, Mandava said. The issue is that cancers also appear white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"If you have more dense breast tissue, then it's harder to differentiate between a cancer and the tissue," Mandava said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/22/PDTN/83217584007-mammo-ultra.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=660&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/22/PDTN/83217584007-mammo-ultra.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=1320&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="These are side-by-side breast scans from a 69-year-old female patient with no symptoms and dense breasts.

Breast density refers to the amount of fibroglandular tissue, or the fibrous connective tissue and milk ducts and lobules, found in the breast, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/fibroglandular-breast-tissue" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;according to the National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"When you look at women who have the fatty tissue ... the pickup rate for cancer in those women is about 90%, but when you look at the women with dense tissue, the ability to find the cancer goes down to about 50%," said Dr. Murray Rebner, a Corewell Health diagnostic radiologist. "So that's a big difference, and that's why we recommend doing the extra testing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The federal Mammography Quality Standards Act was &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/mammography-quality-standards-act-mqsa-and-mqsa-program/important-information-final-rule-amend-mammography-quality-standards-act-mqsa" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;amended by the Food and Drug Administration on Sept. 10, 2024&lt;/a&gt;. Under the new standards, all facilities must send patients a letter classifying their breast density after administering a mammogram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If a patient's tissue is classified as dense, they must be informed that it can increase the risk of developing breast cancer, make it harder to find breast cancer on a mammogram, and that other imaging may help find cancer. The letter must also encourage the patient to talk to their provider, according to the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People with dense breasts should undergo extra screening, in addition to a mammogram, Rebner said. Doctors like to tailor imaging for patients based on their overall lifetime risk of developing breast cancer, which is based on several factors, including tissue density and genetic predisposition, Rebner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Supplemental screening can range from ultrasounds to molecular breast imaging with radioactive dye, and MRIs, Rebner said. Some techniques, like contrast-enhanced mammography, are still under investigation but may prove to be almost as good as MRIs at finding breast cancers, Rebner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/19/PDTN/83166650007-0418-kk-breast-cancer-screening-01.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=440&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/19/PDTN/83166650007-0418-kk-breast-cancer-screening-01.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=880&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Signage indicates the mammography, bone densitometry and breast ultrasound department of the Ascension St. John Hospital Health Center in St. Clair Shores, now part of Henry Ford Health."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Signage indicates the mammography, bone densitometry and breast ultrasound department of the Ascension St. John Hospital Health Center in St. Clair Shores, now part of Henry Ford Health." data-c-credit="Katy Kildee, The Detroit News"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"For high-risk women, women who, let's say, have a greater than 20% lifetime risk of getting breast cancer, those patients we typically recommend doing MRIs on," Rebner said. "MRI is really, right now, the best test at finding the most number of cancers for women who need an additional screening test."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Often, physicians will recommend that patients undergo a breast cancer risk assessment if they have dense breast tissue, Mandava said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"That will basically show if you are at high risk, and if you are, then there are supplemental tools," Mandava said. "You can get an MRI, you can do a whole breast ultrasound. There's a new modality coming out, or it has come out, but it's still new, called contrast-enhanced mammography."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Screening is currently the best tool available to fight breast cancer, Rebner said. Finding cancers earlier also allows physicians to treat them more efficiently, potentially avoiding chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or extensive surgeries, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"The purpose of screening is to find breast cancer at its earliest point of development," Rebner said. "By finding cancers earlier on ... if you do that, you reduce mortality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Additional screenings, out of pocket&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Michigan is one of 14 states that have no insurance law for coverage of 3D or supplemental screening for breast cancer, according to Dense Breast Info.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Advocates such as Awad applaud the recent FDA mammography notification changes but say it's only the first step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Awad, who lives in Ohio, said she was informed that she has dense breast tissue, and she pays an additional out-of-pocket fee for a more advanced mammogram. Not everyone is able to access additional screening methods, can afford out-of-pocket costs if their insurance doesn't cover it, or is aware of what their screening options beyond regular mammograms are, she said. Coverage varies by both state and insurance provider, Awad said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"It's very important to not forget that everyone's accessibility to health care is different," Awad said. "While I might live or you might live in an area with high-quality and highly trained technicians ... not everyone does."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/19/PDTN/83166653007-0418-kk-breast-cancer-screening-02.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=440&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/19/PDTN/83166653007-0418-kk-breast-cancer-screening-02.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=880&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Information is posted on a corkboard inside the mammography, bone densitometry and breast ultrasound department of the Ascension St. John Hospital Health Center, now part of Henry Ford Health."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Information is posted on a corkboard inside the mammography, bone densitometry and breast ultrasound department of the Ascension St. John Hospital Health Center, now part of Henry Ford Health." data-c-credit="Katy Kildee, The Detroit News"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Coverage varies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In Michigan, coverage varies for additional screenings, which can range from $250 to $1,000 out of pocket for a breast MRI to $250 to $400 for a breast ultrasound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Priority Health said they cover 3D mammography as a preventive measure, and have done so since Michigan's Breast Density Notification law passed in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"MRIs or whole-breast ultrasounds are used as part of diagnostic measures and may include member cost sharing," Priority Health said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, which covers digital breast 3D mammography or 2D mammography starting at age 40, said its medical policies are also reviewed annually, or when significant evidence is released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Michigan's Medicaid program, for low-income residents and some with disabilities, covers mammograms for screening purposes in accordance with guidelines from the American Cancer Society and United States Preventive Services Task Force, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman Lynn Sutfin said. But she said there "is not enough evidence for the Task Force to recommend for or against additional screening with breast ultrasound or MRI."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Women are generally told that they have dense breasts after they’ve had a mammogram. These women deserve to know whether and how additional screening might help them stay healthy," the &lt;a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/breast-cancer-screening#:~:text=Frequently%20Asked%20Questions,of%20dying%20from%20this%20disease." data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;task force's recommendation&lt;/a&gt;, which was published last April, said. "... We are urgently calling for more research on whether and how additional screening might help women with dense breasts find cancers earlier."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Sutfin also said that Michigan Medicaid has a process to support coverage of diagnostic mammograms at different intervals, ages, or frequencies when needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Aetna said its coverage of supplemental breast imaging for both medical and preventive care complies with federal and state regulations, as well as plan-specific benefits, spokesman Phillip Brando wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Health Alliance Plan and Meridian did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;A nonprofit is born&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Hallowell, moved to act by her sister's diagnosis, founded a nonprofit called &lt;a href="https://www.operationbreastdensity.org/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Operation Breast Density&lt;/a&gt; to educate people about what breast density is, how people can determine their breast density, and how to talk to their physician about it. The nonprofit also hosts an annual symposium to educate clinicians and raise funds to help people pay for supplemental imaging when their insurance doesn't cover it, she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Seeing someone that knew how to advocate for ... themselves and knew what should be done, and still they weren't given correct service, I decided to start the nonprofit to educate women," Hallowell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People with a diagnosis of breast density from a mammogram within the last two years, and a prescription for supplemental imaging from their physician, can reach out to the nonprofit for financial assistance, Hallowell said. They partner with imaging companies across Michigan to provide the scans at discounted rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"It's a huge barrier; women are getting delayed diagnoses," Hallowell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Hallowell also pointed out that it is cheaper to pay for an ultrasound or MRI and catch a cancer early, rather than months or years of chemotherapy and radiation therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;After undergoing chemotherapy and a bilateral mastectomy, Greaves is now in remission, Hallowell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"When women get that letter, they really the first thing to do is to do their risk assessment, calculate their lifetime risk of breast cancer," Hallowell said. "If you have dense breasts, you need annual, so every year, you need something else to image your breasts, whether it's an ultrasound or an MRI, besides the mammogram."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;hmackay@detroitnews.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 03:07:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAJBVV95cUxOUGdmaXhrODNuQXdtUF85b2piamtYMHBzLTZFZjlLRjNmU0JpNklvTjVGWjRnbHY3ZmtDUDBWQURLbl9HVy1yWE8yeDg3RXVPWkNtOHpIT0szOUJfbS1DWG5vbTlLd19NNTltQVEzR2FGampYN040TU54bkRXOXp2X0Y2dFAzV2REWVdsV0dZemREVUJJY3U5aG1DMUZOSUttT1NiMVYzM2VaTjNvdktfc1ZMUk1oN3hUNmRsdEhubjF6Ui1KRElXUzNDa3hwcWN5aE54aWJFbnh2b0g1emQ2WjNVMXBtcGVzX3A2UlBPaFRKajg2WDJaTDB0NUlRb2Zu</guid></item><item><title>102岁的营养学教授分享了他长寿发誓的七条规则-并坚持认为基因有-每日邮报 | 102-year-old nutrition professor shares the seven rules he swears by for a long life - and insists genes have - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A sprightly 102-year-old professor of nutrition has revealed the seven lifestyle habits that anyone can follow for a long and heathy life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr John Scharffenberg, an adjunct professor at Loma Linda University in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-a5426630-2493-11f0-95c2-a5720af79fa2"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;,  recently revealed his advice for prolonging health and promoting longevity in a series of interviews and talks in several YouTube &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGy3jhiPqD0"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Born in December 1923, the doctor still lives an independent life, travels the world, drives by himself and remains mentally sharp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Accordingly, the centenarian nutritionist is a living and breathing example of the potential health benefits that can result from following his seven lifestyle habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Scharffenberg also dismissed the idea that genetics have played a role in his longevity, noting that his mother passed away in her 60s from &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-a5409170-2493-11f0-95c2-a5720af79fa2"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease, and that his father succumbed to a heart attack at 76.

He also referred to a &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199801083380204"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that found people who walked more than two miles (3.22km) a day had only half the death rate of those who were less active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Scharffenberg even said in an &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/101-year-old-nutrition-professor-rules-for-long-life-rcna199726"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with TODAY that he believes his highly active lifestyle was the reason he 'outlived' his two brothers by decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The main difference was I got a tremendous amount of exercise,' he theorised. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="femail-ccox mol-style-medium"&gt;Rule #4 - No snacking and eat by the clock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the core of Dr Scharffenberg's rules is that what you eat makes a difference – and that means ensuring you maintain a healthy weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The nutrition professor recommends implementing simple guidelines around eating habits to ensure you don't gain unnecessary weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Eat at the proper time.

Instead, he follows a total plant-based diet, which includes milk and eggs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Scharffenberg's favourite foods include mangoes, persimmons, potatoes, macadamias and other nuts and seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says a vegetarian diet is 'optimum' because eating too much meat can &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/eating-red-meat-daily-triples-heart-disease-related-chemical#:~:text=High%20saturated%20fat%20levels%20in,affect%20heart%20disease%20is%20complex."&gt;increase the risk &lt;/a&gt;of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nutrition professor Dr Scharffenberg follows a total plant-based diet, which includes milk and eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="femail-ccox mol-style-medium"&gt;Rule #6 - Get saturated fat intake down by cutting meat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This rule ties back into Dr Scharffenberg's edict about the benefits of adopting a vegetarian diet, because loads of saturated fats come from meat like beef, pork and poultry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Accordingly, Dr Scharffenberg says adhering to a vegetarian diet and getting rid of animal fat intake is the simplest way to avoid the &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/eating-red-meat-daily-triples-heart-disease-related-chemical#:~:text=High%20saturated%20fat%20levels%20in,affect%20heart%20disease%20is%20complex."&gt;risks&lt;/a&gt; associated with high saturated fat intake, like high blood pressure and high cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="femail-ccox mol-style-medium"&gt;Rule #7 - Say 'no' to your sweet tooth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Scharffenberg points to a clear link between sugar consumption and the &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/eating-too-much-added-sugar-increases-the-risk-of-dying-with-heart-disease-201402067021"&gt;increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of heart disease as well as other weight gain related health issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He recommends modifying recipes to reduce sugar intake.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians say proper hydration is critical for healthy blood sugar. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with diabetes may be prone to dehydration, so fluids are especially important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low-sugar fruits, veggies and Greek yogurt are fluid-rich and diabetes-friendly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Staying hydrated and managing blood sugar are two essential pillars of overall health. And they’re particularly important if you’re living with type 2 diabetes—for several reasons. The first is that high blood sugar levels may lead to increased urination, which may cause dehydration.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Proper hydration is also crucial for supporting kidney function. Since the kidneys play a vital role in filtering excess sugar from the blood, dehydration can put additional strain on these organs if you have diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news is that there are certain water-rich foods that can be a delicious part of a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7886108/diabetes-meal-plan-for-beginners/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diabetes-friendly diet&lt;/a&gt; and provide the fluids you need. To find out which ones are best, we reached out to registered dietitians. Here are their top hydrating foods for healthy blood sugar. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-cucumbers"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Cucumbers &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 Cup Sliced Cucumbers = 3.3 Ounces H2O&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Boasting roughly 95% water, cucumbers can help keep you refreshed and hydrated without having to rely on sugary or caloric drinks.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  With just 4 grams of carbohydrates per cup, they’re also a blood sugar–friendly food. Their skin also provides a bit of fiber, which can prevent rapid glucose spikes, says Orlando-based registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johannahkatz/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Johannah Katz, M.A., RD&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you like adding them to salads, blending them into a refreshing smoothie or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252056/creamy-cucumber-soup/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;soup&lt;/a&gt;, or you simply enjoy them sliced as a crunchy snack, cucumbers are an easy, nutrient-rich way to bump up your fluids. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-okra"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Okra  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 Cup Cooked Okra = 5 Ounces H2O&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Okra might not be on your radar, but it should be! Not only is okra 93% water, it provides 4 grams of blood sugar–stabilizing fiber per cup.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Okra contains a gel-like soluble fiber, which slows down sugar absorption,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anosiri/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Adaure Nosiri, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, an Atlanta-based registered dietitian. “Okra also contains antioxidants like flavonoids and polyphenols, which play a role in reducing inflammation and improving glucose metabolism.” One cooked cup of this veggie contains 7 grams of carbs, making it easy to fit into a balanced meal plan. Plus, it supplies &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-benefits-8656021" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, a mineral that plays a pivotal role in blood sugar regulation. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Try it roasted, steamed or in soups for a versatile, hydrating addition to your diet. If you’ve never made okra before, give our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252686/black-eyed-peas-okra/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Black Eyed Peas &amp;amp; Okra&lt;/a&gt; a go. This diabetes-friendly side packs 7 grams of fiber per serving plus 11% of the Daily Value for magnesium.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-apples"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Apples  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 Medium Apple = 5.2 Ounces H20&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Apples are made up of about 85% water and are high in fiber, with about 4 grams in a medium apple,” says &lt;a href="https://www.healthprofs.com/us/nutritionists-dietitians/stephanie-deming-churchville-ny/1390520" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Stephanie Deming, M.S., RDN, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and owner of Bespoke Family Nutrition, PLLC.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you’re worried about their sugar, there’s no need to be. Apples’ rich fiber slows the absorption of their sugars for a steady, prolonged energy release. Just make sure to eat the skins. They contain special fibers like pectin and cellulose that may help manage blood sugar.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Apples are so beneficial that one small study found that people with impaired blood sugar control who ate an apple before a high-carb meal experienced fewer blood sugar spikes than when they ate only simple carbs from rice.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, bite into a crunchy apple when you need a satisfying snack (pair it with nut butter to add some healthy fats and protein for satiety support!). Or, for a hearty dinner, try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252584/apple-cider-chicken/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Apple Cider Chicken&lt;/a&gt;. It’s diabetes-friendly and takes just 30 minutes to prepare!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This juicy citrus fruit is composed of 90% water, making it an excellent way to quench your thirst while adding a burst of refreshing flavor to your day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Not only do grapefruits have a high water content, but they also provide your body with an important electrolyte, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069581/what-does-potassium-do/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;, which helps with overall fluid balance,” says &lt;a href="http://www.wellnourishedmamas.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Jamie Adams, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian specializing in women’s health. Additionally, grapefruit’s fiber slows the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream, promoting steadier energy levels. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether enjoyed as a snack, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8023984/grapefruit-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;in a zesty salad&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269497/pineapple-grapefruit-detox-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;added to a smoothie&lt;/a&gt;, this fruit is a delicious, nutritious addition to any diet.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 Cup Diced Watermelon = 4.6 Ounces H2O&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As its name suggests, watermelon is an incredibly hydrating food (it’s 91% water!).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That makes it an ideal choice for staying hydrated on hot days while enjoying a naturally sweet treat. And despite what you might have heard, it has only 9 grams of sugar per cup. So, it can easily fit into a blood sugar management plan. Plus, watermelon contains citrulline, an amino acid that supports the production of nitric oxide, a compound that promotes better blood flow. While more research is needed, emerging research suggests citrulline may also improve insulin resistance and help manage blood sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, watermelon is juicy and refreshing on its own. For even more blood sugar–lowering power, pair it with a small serving of nuts or cheese to balance its carbohydrates. Or try our low-carb &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/272847/watermelon-cucumber-feta-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Watermelon, Cucumber &amp;amp; Feta Salad&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 (5.6-Ounce) Container Nonfat Plain Greek Yogurt = 4.4 Ounces H2O&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Plain unsweetened Greek yogurt is a high-moisture food, and not only offers a quality source of protein, but is also low in carbohydrate and sugar,” says &lt;a href="https://www.milkandhoneynutrition.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mary Ellen Phipps, M.P.H., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and author of &lt;em&gt;The Easy Diabetes Cookbook&lt;/em&gt;. “That makes it a perfect combination for people who have to pay attention to their blood sugars.” While a single-serve container of plain Greek yogurt only has about 6 grams of carbohydrates, flavored yogurt can have lots of added sugars. If plain yogurt isn’t your thing, look for no-sugar-added varieties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Greek yogurt is roughly 80% water. That’s not all, though. A 5.6-ounce container provides about 16 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s an added bonus, as protein slows digestion for steady blood sugar levels. Because protein also helps keep you full, it can help with weight loss if that’s part of your diabetes management plan. And if you need one more reason to toss a container in your shopping cart, Greek yogurt offers probiotics, promoting gut health, which is &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gut-health-and-diabetes-8584301" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;increasingly linked to better blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; management.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For a refreshing, hydrating snack, top plain Greek yogurt with a handful of fresh berries or a sprinkle of cinnamon. You can also try your hand at our&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252990/homemade-plain-greek-yogurt/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; DIY homemade Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt; if you enjoy making things from scratch!

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Staying hydrated and keeping your blood sugar steady are two key steps to feeling your best, especially if you’re living with type 2 diabetes. The good news? You can tackle both at once by adding delicious, nutrient-packed, hydrating foods to your meals. Think crisp cucumbers, tender okra, juicy apples, tangy grapefruit, refreshing watermelon and creamy plain Greek yogurt. These powerhouse foods will quench your thirst and help keep your blood sugar in check. Now that’s a win-win!&lt;br&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — As the weather warms and people start cleaning, the Utah Department of Health and Human Services issued a warning about hantavirus — a disease passed through droppings, urine and saliva of mice or other rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Stirring up dust where rodents have been can cause hantavirus to get into the air where the particles can be breathed in," the department said Monday in a prepared release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It urges Utahns to be cautious when cleaning out sheds, cabins or other buildings that have had rodents present. The health department said hantavirus is rare; there are typically one or two reported cases in Utah each year, but it is fatal in about 60% of reported cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of hantavirus include fatigue, fever and muscle aches and can include headaches, dizziness, chills or stomach issues. A second phase of the disease brings coughing and shortness of breath due to liquid in the lungs, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kacy Nowak, an epidemiologist with the health department, said anyone who comes into contact with rodents that carry the virus is at risk for contracting hantavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Make sure you take precautions when you work in areas with potential rodent droppings and nests. Use a disinfectant spray on areas with droppings and wait 15-20 minutes before you clean. This will kill the virus and decrease your risk," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/prevention/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;other steps&lt;/a&gt; people can take to prevent contracting hantavirus include airing out closed buildings before going in, not sweeping droppings up, trapping mice, keeping pet food covered to not attract mice, sealing holes in homes and removing piles of trash, wood or junk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When cleaning up after rodents, the health department encouraged wearing rubber or plastic gloves and washing hands afterwards; soaking urine, droppings and nests with bleach or disinfectant before cleaning; throwing away towels used to clean up in a covered can; and cleaning the area with a disinfectant again after removing the nest or droppings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Mexico authorities say actor Gene Hackman's wife, Betsy Arakawa, likely died Feb. 11 at their Santa Fe home from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Her autopsy report hasn't yet been released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Associated Press story published Monday said the leading cause of Hackman's death was heart disease. He was also in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease and likely had not eaten for a long time, according to a new autopsy report. He appeared to have outlived Arakawa at home by about a week, possibly unaware of his wife's death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AUSTIN, Texas — As health officials begin &lt;a href="/article/news/health/austin-measles-exposure-warning-contact-tracing/269-1142c886-b99c-47e6-8adf-973a14542a0a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;contact tracing a second measles case in Travis County&lt;/a&gt;, some businesses are taking extra precautions to deal with the exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austin Public Health identified nine locations across Austin where the infected person visited, including the South Austin Mexican restaurant, Curra's, which has been around for decades.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Julieta Rodriguez, the owner of Curra's, said she learned about the exposure at her establishment through news reports and had not heard from health officials.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My first thought was, it’s going to kill business,” Rodriguez said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately, Rodriguez said she hired a cleaning company to disinfect the restaurant over the weekend and has spoken to customers and staff since the case was reported.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Every day we clean," Rodriguez said. "We follow protocol with health codes, so that's pretty much what we can do as far as right now."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez added that she and her staff are vaccinated and have not felt any symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I can tell my customers is not to feel worried," Rodriguez said. “We're doing what we’re supposed to do."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health officials stressed there is still a risk of exposure despite the person who was infected being fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know that a person who has been vaccinated is going to have less viral load,” said Dr. Desmar Walkes, the medical director and health authority for Austin Public Health. "While the patient did catch the virus, they only have mild symptoms and are able to rest at home."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walkes also shared what health officials are doing in terms of outreach after Rodriguez said she wasn't aware of the exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been calling those businesses, and we'll continue to do so to work with them to provide the information they need,” Walkes said. "It may have been that they hadn't received that call as of yet.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walkes, along with Austin Mayor Kirk Watson and Travis County Judge Andy Brown, reiterated the importance of getting the MMR vaccine as they ensure it is the best protection against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The key message today is that while we've had this second case of measles ... the best defense is vaccination,” Watson said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for people who are unsure of their immunity status against the virus, they can speak with their health provider and take a test. For many who may be wondering whether they need a booster, Walkes said the two required doses should be sufficient unless one’s immune system is compromised.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

The above image shows hazmat-suited workers at a quarantine zone after an outbreak of bird flu in Victoria, Australia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A fellow GVN director and expert on animal viruses, Dr Ab Osterhaus, says that a potential vaccine could also help to solve the crisis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Given the growing circulation of H5N1 among mammals, the GVN calls for urgent efforts to understand and interrupt transmission in cattle through herd management and potential vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Strengthening surveillance at animal-human interfaces is crucial, as current monitoring efforts are insufficient to guide effective prevention strategies.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Biden Administration awarded Moderna a $590 million contract to develop a vaccine for H5N1 bird flu vaccine but there were reports earlier this year that the new administration could pull that funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response (OPPR), created after COVID-19 to coordinate rapid responses to outbreaks, has been left virtually unstaffed and unfunded since the Trump Administration came in, according to reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pandemic planning has also been moved inside the National Security Council, which critics fear limits transparency and public oversight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first US &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/bird-flu/index.html" id="mol-df4a7cb0-cc77-11ef-9df4-6dd46bea0ad2"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; death was reported in January, with a person in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/louisiana/index.html" id="mol-df550400-cc77-11ef-9df4-6dd46bea0ad2" class=""&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; passing away after being hospitalized with severe respiratory symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials said the person was older than 65, had underlying medical problems and had been in contact with sick and dead birds in a backyard flock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No other details were revealed. They also said a genetic analysis of the patient's infection suggested the bird &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html" id="mol-df4c9f90-cc77-11ef-9df4-6dd46bea0ad2" class=""&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; virus had mutated while inside their body, which could have caused a more severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since March 2024, 70 confirmed bird flu infections have been reported in the US, but most illnesses have been mild and most have been detected among farmworkers directly exposed to sick poultry or dairy cows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In two cases - an adult in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/missouri/index.html" id="mol-df555220-cc77-11ef-9df4-6dd46bea0ad2"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt; and a child in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-df53cb80-cc77-11ef-9df4-6dd46bea0ad2"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; - health officials have not determined how they contracted the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many experts put H5N1 at the top of their lists of pandemic threats, due to how widespread it is among animals and how rapidly it appears to be mutating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its growing presence in the environment increases the chances people will be exposed, and potentially catch it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Marc Johnson, a virologist at the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/missouri/index.html" id="mol-81777ee0-246e-11f0-b9de-a9e256473e2a" class=""&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, recently said on X: 'This virus might not go pandemic, but it is really trying hard, and it sure is getting a lot of opportunities.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Leading health experts are warning that the US could be on the brink of another pandemic, with bird flu now present in all 50 states and millions of poultry culled every week as a result&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The GVN is now calling on world governments to address the threat of H5N1 avian influenza by improving surveillance and implementing biosecurity measures &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, figures show since the virus was detected in the US in January 2022, more than 12,875 wild and domestic flocks have been infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After&lt;span&gt; the virus spread to cows this year, it was diagnosed in 1,031 herds across 17 states - with the majority in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-d808d6d0-be4a-11ef-b15c-3b2cf3c0c1bd"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/colorado/index.html" id="mol-d80924f0-be4a-11ef-b15c-3b2cf3c0c1bd"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And 70 cases have now been detected in humans across 14 states this year, the most cases reported in the US in at least two decades. Before the current outbreak, the last human case of bird flu was in 1997.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is no evidence any of the patients spread the disease to other patients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the virus has been detected in unpasteurized or 'raw' milks, leading the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to announce that all companies handling raw milk will be &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14166987/trendy-milk-tested-bird-flu-threat.html"&gt;required to share samples&lt;/a&gt; for testing upon request. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many experts, including officials at the World Health Organization, have criticized the US' response to the outbreak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts have described it as a pandemic 'unfolding in slow motion.' Until the end of 2024, nearly all testing of cattle and of people exposed to infected cows were voluntary. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even now, mandatory testing is limited only to cattle moving between state lines.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cases have also been sporadically recorded in pigs, which has concerned researchers because these animals can catch both human and bird strains of flu - and could be 'mixing vessels' for a new strain of bird flu virus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;This map shows cases of the virus detected in wild mammals, such as red foxes and seals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And infections have been recorded among more than 400 non-bird wild animals in the US since May 2022, including red foxes, skunks, seals and raccoons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts warned these animals may pick up the virus after eating from carcasses of birds that had died from the bird flu.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wastewater surveillance for the virus has also picked up traces in 60 of the more than 250 sites monitored across the US. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In California and Iowa, more than 80 percent of samples have tested positive. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US already has a stockpile of about 20million bird &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html" id="mol-b24635c0-bef7-11ef-b93e-fd05780f214b"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; vaccines in its national stockpile, officials say, which are 'well matched' to the H5N1 virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also has the capacity to quickly make 100million more if necessary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are also supplies of antivirals such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) - which used to treat the latest US bird flu patient in Louisiana - available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still ongoing, is work to develop a bird flu vaccine for poultry and tests showing that human antivirals would work just as well on sick cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Some people lose part or all of their esophagus or stomach, making it hard or impossible to eat normally. Others may need a bag to collect stool or lose the ability to get pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;All 49 patients with early-stage rectal cancer who received six months of immunotherapy were able to avoid surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"And it's after six months of treatment, their tumors were completely gone," said another one of the study's authors, Dr. Andrea Cercek, head of the Colorectal Section at MSK. "They didn't need any other treatment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Two years later, 92% remained cancer-free. Among the first group to reach the five-year mark, all four patients were still disease-free — and two of them had gone on to have two children each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The amazing thing is they would not have been able to conceive or carry children had they gone through standard therapy," Diaz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As for patients with other early-stage cancers, 35 of 54 were cancer-free after undergoing immunotherapy and were able to avoid surgery. However, two patients still chose to proceed with surgery — one for peace of mind and the other to remove medical hardware related to the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Of the five patients whose cancers came back, most were successfully treated again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Cercek explained that, while immunotherapy alone may not yet help most cancer patients avoid surgery, their work opens the door for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Just close your eyes and just imagine that one day you're diagnosed with cancer and you don't have your esophagus or your stomach or your rectum or your bladder, and you can avoid that," Diaz said. "For these 3% we can completely eliminate the need for surgery. It's quite transformational."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;By combining different approaches with this type of immunotherapy, Cercek hoped they can replicate their success in more types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"So, we are continuing this trial and we are working on expanding the study outside of Memorial with more patients so that we can offer this therapy as a standard of care," Cercek said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Luis Gasca -- an internal medicine resident at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Michigan, and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit -- contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 23:07:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxPRVM1Wl81VHQxTFh3ZXV6RTgySFgzeVZXX3JmNWY5eUJGVnIwOVlDZndReVlraTF5V1BhcnExVkFWek51OFppdXpZLS1aRGttNi1HMktFT0d2cF9haTlUeVVvczdLZFp0S0lBbnhVQklHWWtOVXNqV1RxeF81bDRFQ25zRXA5b21aWGxyUFctVWlhakNUY0dIcE5nWm9ycTZzUXd6SkxWQ0FORm5zVzNz0gG0AUFVX3lxTE5YdnJhU0J1dWtVZGpDQWo0ZGVIRy1TbmJaTUgzd0hFYVZvR3B6WXVIV1pQYkFleDBJNU15c1lRRm16M0VYNXJRd0wzbEVUS2hUUlFlMWw4TXVZQUhoaUVpdXJSREN3eUFDNjdReGdXaHA4R1FTUGtGWXZmLVdXOXlhazFSbEFneHZaTFlmWklDai1qaTlJcGxKenZwUTFRRTVFbENTVmhtbXVEd3lqYUdvcjZ5SQ</guid></item><item><title>为什么男同性恋者更容易患上ED ？他们能做些什么？ - Queerty | Why are gay men more likely to experience ED &amp; what can they do about it? - Queerty</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxPeEdxSUxrVlZDcXlvYTItYkRGWTdKT3Q1UUhNSThTTzRDREhSbW80OFpoZlg3ZTRTYWZUZDFDUnJ5OUVJWUNhUGZnZ1BZNUR6bDZHblBNZEJoeEY4M0VGcFNSUWk4ZF8wZk9MYTlyUGhDNlBMbV9XUGw3VlEyY1lHR2gzV2RuU3cwSkhnM1lwREI5QUVWWi1aODJvNUpzRWxXTFBoeGgtOA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="cf-column"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Press release from the Humboldt-Del Norte Veterinary Medical Association&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Humboldt-Del Norte Veterinary Medical Association is sponsoring a county-wide low-cost
canine rabies vaccination clinic. The Humboldt-Del Norte Veterinary Medical Association offers
these low-cost canine rabies clinics as a public service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important that all dogs and cats be
vaccinated, as we have had several cases of rabies in wildlife and pets in Humboldt County as
recently as the last few months. Foxes, skunks, and bats are a few examples of rabies carriers.
We will be vaccinating dogs at the cost of $10.00 per rabies vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other canine and feline vaccinations will be available. The costs of these vaccines will vary with
the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, please contact the animal hospital you would be interested in taking
your pet(s) to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinic Schedule:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thursday, May 1, 8 a.m.-5 p.m.:&lt;/b&gt; Sunny Brae Animal Clinic
Saturday&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Saturday, June 7, 8 a.m.-1 p.m.: &lt;/b&gt;Myrtle Ave Veterinary Clinic &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thursday, July 17,  8 a.m.-noon:&lt;/b&gt; Arcata Animal Hospital&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional clinics are available in Trinity County. Please call for dates and times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie Lisignoli, RVT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the shadow cast over cancer research by recent actions in the Trump administration, cancer scientists and oncologists told STAT that they’re as excited as ever about advances and innovation in their field. Indeed, this year’s conference features notable findings, some of which could transform cancer prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more than 21,000 people here at McCormick Place Convention Center in Chicago, AACR attendance still feels very strong. On a large poster outside the main exhibition hall, attendees have been pinning their home city on a world map. By the end of Day 2, that map bristles with multicolored clusters of pins stuck all around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
