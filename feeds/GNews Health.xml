We quickly understood how deadly an infection could be, especially for those with underlying conditions like diabetes and heart disease. But it has taken years of research to start making sense of how a bout of Covid can lead to lasting, sometimes invisible changes in different parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Some of these effects, such as chronic fatigue and brain fog, are considered long Covid, defined as symptoms from an infection that persist for at least three months. By some estimates, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/health/long-covid-world.html" title=""&gt;400 million people worldwide&lt;/a&gt; have been diagnosed with some form of long Covid. But an infection can also lead to other issues, including lung and heart damage and microbiome changes in the gut, that may not always be recognized as long Covid but can still have a lasting effect on our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;We now have a better sense of what might be behind those changes, including the role of the widespread inflammation that Covid can cause. For most people, inflammation will subside once the virus clears. But for some, if it “rages” too intensely or persists as a “slow burn” for too long, it can wreak havoc around the body, said Dr. Braden Kuo, a neurogastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Here’s what scientists have learned so far about inflammation and the other factors driving these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-tosae5 eoo0vm40" id="link-300a4cd4"&gt;The Lungs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 09:00:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE9mV0VVUkE1dHI1UEQtRC1EMHBPUXFLb2FRc0F5Q0lMYjVnRGkxNGRSR2ZTS2xYYWRBZ1dTZXNpU0NBTEhNdE5JOTBRcVpuZ1VtOHhnTU9rZjZLZjl1V2I0bUZkaHFuVkM1bkJFc084RUx4ZEw3TVVmOHAyVGJ4eDg</guid></item><item><title>A Hidden Awakening in The Brain May Explain Why Females Age Slower - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxOUzRfdVdNX2FHbDMyMFJ6TlE0c2ZqTjQ3N2JKRTVmUG1RaFhQUEJXc0dTdWlQeWJPNDkyTTNtWlRadUQ1NHRlNjBzM0l0YkZzTEpsaXdiSnBESnVSWjZ0Sk9uRWczTXlaWi02ajg0aUJiNFJIazNMZi1DcE5BdWpwMElmMGZKTnB2Y0JtWkVFd1dmOUFaV3pFLWk0QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The 'silent' X chromosome within female brains may not be so silent after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study has found evidence in both mice and humans that as we age, 'sleeping' X chromosomes can be 'awakened' in brain cells critical to learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overlooked influence of this genetic library could be a key reason why &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/it-s-not-just-humans-females-outlive-males-in-other-mammals-too"&gt;females live longer than males&lt;/a&gt; and exhibit slower cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In typical aging, women have a brain that looks younger, with fewer cognitive deficits compared to men," &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/03/429571/silent-x-chromosome-gives-aging-female-brain-boost"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Dena Dubal from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results show that the silent X in females actually reawakens late in life, probably helping to slow cognitive decline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154260" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154260" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-in-hippocampus-642x406.jpg" alt="Brain Cells Hippocampus" class="size-medium wp-image-154260" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-in-hippocampus-642x406.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-in-hippocampus-657x415.jpg 657w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-in-hippocampus-768x485.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-in-hippocampus-600x379.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-in-hippocampus.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154260" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Oligodendrocytes (green), in the hippocampus of the mouse brain. These cells often deteriorate during aging. (Gadek et al., &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The X chromosome harbors about 5 percent of the human genome, and it is largely understudied in the aging brain, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ads8169"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; Dubal and her co-authors from UCSF, led by neurologist Margaret Gadek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Female mammals possess two X chromosomes - one from each parent – but in each cell of the body, a random one of those chromosomes is silenced and the other is activated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some select genes from the X chromosome, however, can escape inactivation, and evidence suggests that as we grow older, more X chromosomes are not held down by genetic 'gag orders'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that the expression of both X chromosomes could potentially drive the different ways that male and female brains age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test that idea, researchers investigated brain cells in the female hippocampus, which is a brain region strongly involved in learning, memory, and emotional processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the team studied mice with X chromosomes from two different rodent 'strains', &lt;i&gt;Mus musculus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;M. castaneus. &lt;/i&gt;In their models, the X chromosome in &lt;i&gt;M. musculus&lt;/i&gt; is missing an important gene, called Xist, which means it cannot be silenced like usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means in some of their offspring the &lt;i&gt;M. castaneus&lt;/i&gt; X chromosome is always the one getting deactivated, so if its genetic effects show up in brain cells, then it is considered an "escapee".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154262" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154262" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MouseGeneticX-642x587.png" alt="Mouse X Chromosomes" class="size-medium wp-image-154262" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MouseGeneticX-642x587.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MouseGeneticX-454x415.png 454w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MouseGeneticX-768x702.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MouseGeneticX-600x548.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MouseGeneticX.png 952w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154262" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;em&gt;M. musculus&lt;/em&gt; XX mice with an Xist deletion were crossed with XY &lt;em&gt;M. castaneus&lt;/em&gt; mice. XX progeny without an Xist deletion (left) underwent random X chromosome inactivation. XX progeny with an Xist deletion (right) harbor an active X chromosome strictly from the &lt;em&gt;M. musculus&lt;/em&gt; strain and an inactive X chromosome from the &lt;em&gt;M. castaneus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using RNA sequencing, researchers looked at the nuclei of 40,000 hippocampal cells in four young and four old female mice to figure out which X chromosome is active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readings that rose from the X were 91.7 percent &lt;em&gt;M. musculus&lt;/em&gt; and 8.3 percent&lt;em&gt; M. castaneus&lt;/em&gt;. Because the &lt;em&gt;M. castaneus&lt;/em&gt; X chromosome was supposed to be silenced, this suggests between 3 and 7 percent of its genes somehow escaped inactivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was true of most cell types in the mouse hippocampus, and more so in older brains. The cells most likely to express genes of the inactive X include &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentate_gyrus"&gt;dentate gyrus&lt;/a&gt; neurons, which play a critical role in memory, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprise-alzheimers-finding-brains-support-cells-may-be-fueling-disease"&gt;oligodendrocytes&lt;/a&gt;, which support the formation of neural connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see if these findings extend to human brains, researchers at UCSF looked through previously published data on inactive X genes that change with age in at least one or more types of brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around half of the aging-induced targets identified on the inactivated X chromosome caused human intellectual disability if mutated. This suggests that the inactivated X chromosome carries genes enriched for cognition-related factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these genes, called &lt;em&gt;PLP1&lt;/em&gt;, particularly increases its expression with age in the neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes of the dentate gyrus. The &lt;em&gt;PLP1 &lt;/em&gt;gene expresses &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_proteolipid_protein"&gt;a protein involved in the formation of myelin sheaths&lt;/a&gt; that surround neurons and allow them to send messages more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In parallel to mice, older women showed increased &lt;em&gt;PLP1&lt;/em&gt; expression in the parahippocampus, compared to older men," the authors &lt;a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ads8169"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154428" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154428" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-mouse-brain-square-642x642.jpg" alt="Female Sex Chromosomes May Explain Why Some Brains Age Slower" class="size-medium wp-image-154428" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-mouse-brain-square-642x642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-mouse-brain-square-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-mouse-brain-square-600x600.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-mouse-brain-square.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154428" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Oligodendrocytes in the mouse brain are shown in yellow. When expressed in oligodendrocytes in the hippocampus, &lt;em&gt;PLP1&lt;/em&gt; improved cognition in aging mice. (Gadek et al., &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasing the expression of the &lt;em&gt;PLP1&lt;/em&gt; gene in male and female mice improved cognition in the aging brain, enhancing learning and memory in the animal models. This could be a possible target for future treatments of brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The study of female-specific biology is historically underrepresented in science and medicine but is essential and expanding fervently," the team &lt;a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ads8169"&gt;concludes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What X activation broadly means for women's brain health – or for other systems of the body – is now a critical area of investigation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ads8169"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;An outbreak of tuberculosis, or TB – a lung disease that is often accompanied by a hacking cough – began in January 2024 in Kansas City, Kansas, and two nearby counties and &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2242/Tuberculosis-Outbreaks"&gt;continues as of early March 2025&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, 147 people have been reportedly diagnosed with TB in the outbreak, with 67 becoming ill. The remaining 80 people diagnosed with TB in Kansas contracted the illness but showed no symptoms, which is called a latent infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TB is the leading infectious cause of death around the world, outpaced only by &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis"&gt;COVID-19 during the first three years of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q0nZ6HV5VA8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Conversation asked microbiologists &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zEgCkh0AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Karen Dobos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7ZdujPQAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Marcela Henao-Tamayo&lt;/a&gt;, both from Colorado State University, to explain why this ancient disease seems to be making a comeback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's the history of TB?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt; is the organism that causes the disease &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/index.html"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt; in humans. The disease has been infecting humans for thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found evidence of the disease &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0003426"&gt;9,000 years ago&lt;/a&gt; in the excavated remains of people who lived in the Eastern Mediterranean region during that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports of TB date back to around 410-400 B.C.E., when the physician Hippocrates termed the disease phthisis, an archaic word that means a progressive "wasting away," due to the way &lt;a href="https://jmvh.org/article/history-of-tuberculosis-part-1-phthisis-consumption-and-the-white-plague/"&gt;people with the disease become emaciated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TB was also known as consumption for the same reason. Similarly, it was called the white plague or white death – due to anemia from the disease, with people appearing pallid or chalky – leading to near-certain death. Untreated active TB, meaning cases that are symptomatic, is highly lethal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wA_fObLY6GE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half of all people with untreated active TB &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2022/tb-disease-burden/2-2-tb-mortality"&gt;die from the disease&lt;/a&gt;, whereas treatment &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2024/tb-diagnosis-and-treatment/2-3-tb-treatment--coverage-and-outcomes#"&gt;reduces the death rate to 12%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more colorful phrases describing TB is "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.318.7199.1705"&gt;the king's evil&lt;/a&gt;." This is a form of TB that also causes neck swelling and lesions, a condition called scrofula. During the Middle Ages, people believed that the &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/28/3/AC-2803_article"&gt;touch of a king&lt;/a&gt; could cure a person from this form of TB through miraculous intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, TB was most ominously called the "robber of youth" due to its historical propensity to &lt;a href="https://doi-ds.org/doilink/11.2021-59178487/JMVH%20Vol%2022%20No%202"&gt;afflict people 15 to 30 years old&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1865, Jean Antoine Villemin, an army physician in Paris, demonstrated that TB could be transmitted from infected animals to healthy ones through inoculation. Before these studies, the cause of TB was &lt;a href="https://jmvh.org/article/history-of-tuberculosis-part-1-phthisis-consumption-and-the-white-plague/"&gt;presumed to be primarily constitutional&lt;/a&gt;, by either an inherent predisposition or from unhealthy or immoral lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microorganism causing TB was ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000222.htm#"&gt;discovered in 1882&lt;/a&gt; by the German physician Robert Koch. Koch announced his findings on March 24, 1882, a day globally recognized as &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-tb-day"&gt;World TB Day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does TB spread?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis is spread by small infectious droplets in the air. A TB patient may emit these droplets by coughing, singing and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.202110-2378OC"&gt;potentially from regular breathing that occurs during sleep or resting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One form of TB can be spread through &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.02.091"&gt;unpasteurized dairy products&lt;/a&gt;. While rare, there have been reports of TB &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/pdfs/mm725253-H.pdf"&gt;transmission through bone graphs&lt;/a&gt;, in which healthy, donated bone material is used to replace damaged bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The origin of the TB outbreak in Kansas remains unknown as of early March 2025. The outbreak has disproportionately affected those in low-income communities, and two people have died from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, a patient with untreated TB &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis"&gt;can infect 10 to 15 others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Could the COVID-19 pandemic be a factor?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="154446" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="154446" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt; has played a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2022/covid-19-and-tb?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;pivotal role in the resurgence of TB&lt;/a&gt;. Cases &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/global-tuberculosis-report-2024/global-tb-report-2024_factsheet.pdf?"&gt;increased globally by 4.6% from 2020 to 2023&lt;/a&gt;, reversing decades of steady declines in the disease. In the U.S. alone, TB cases rose by &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb-surveillance-report-2023/summary/index.html"&gt;more than 15% from 2022 to 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During mandatory shutdowns, people were &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMp2118145"&gt;less able to access health care centers&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2022.891711"&gt;early diagnosis of TB&lt;/a&gt; or to fill prescriptions for treatment, perhaps due to the fear of contracting COVID-19 while visiting a medical care facility. COVID-19-related disruptions in care &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2024"&gt;resulted in nearly 700,000 excess deaths from TB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access to health care may not be the only factor behind this uptick. Medical supply shortages and delays in shipment may have also played a role. For example, the U.S. experienced &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/php/dear-colleague-letters/2023-tb-drug-shortages.html"&gt;shortages of one of the primary TB drugs&lt;/a&gt; between 2021 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the main treatments?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multidrug treatment is currently the only way to cure TB and stop its spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the late 1930s, when the first antibiotic for TB treatment was developed, TB treatments included bloodletting and consumption of cod liver oil. The most popular treatment involved isolated sanatoriums in high-altitude areas such as the Adirondacks and the Rocky Mountains, where the cold, dry air was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/4574446"&gt;believed to be a cure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars at the time suggested that the potential for cure was due to these environments being more &lt;a href="https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;amp;httpsredir=1&amp;amp;article=1017&amp;amp;context=unm_bulletin"&gt;invigorating for the body and providing more restful sleep&lt;/a&gt;. There is no evidence to support these beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streptomycin was the first antibiotic treatment to become available for TB, in the 1940s. However, the microorganism quickly became drug resistant. A second antibiotic, called isoniazid, was developed as a first-line treatment &lt;a href="https://doi-ds.org/doilink/11.2021-98726273/JMVH"&gt;against TB in the 1950s&lt;/a&gt;. Again, the microorganism became drug resistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two- and four-drug combinations are now used to treat both latent infections and active disease. Treatment of active TB requires at least six months of uninterrupted therapy. Disruptions in treatment result in further spread of TB and the emergence of multidrug resistant TB, which requires additional drugs and more than &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2024/tb-diagnosis-and-treatment"&gt;nine months of treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All TB drugs are toxic; the quality of life for TB patients &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5588/ijtld.22.0514"&gt;deteriorates during treatment&lt;/a&gt; and remains so throughout their lives. Finding cases and treating TB illness early, before symptoms begin, is important because it not only reduces the spread of disease but also greatly reduces drug toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What should people be aware of?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People should be aware that TB is still a public health problem across the globe. Education on the transmission, treatment and need for active work to eradicate TB is the best defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why education and awareness about TB are so important is that a person with latent TB may be unknowingly harboring the microorganism for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the absence of symptoms, these people are unlikely to seek care and will &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(24)00028-6"&gt;not be diagnosed and treated&lt;/a&gt; unless identified as part of an outbreak, as was the case for more than half of the patients in Kansas.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/249450/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

It affects about 100,000 people in the U.S., with most patients either dying or requiring a lung transplant within three to five years of diagnosis. Despite its severity, the disease has no known cause or cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study has the potential to be a game changer,” said Dr. Paul Noble, chair of the Department of Medicine and co-senior author of the study. “We identified a root cause of IPF-related lung damage and a potential therapeutic target that might restore the lungs’ ability to heal themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Graphical abstract on how zinc works in the lungs.

These stem cells, known as type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2s), play a key role in repairing &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-study-reveals-why-most-life-long-smokers-never-develop-lung-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lung tissue&lt;/a&gt;. Without sufficient zinc, their ability to regenerate is impaired, leading to worsening fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By tracing the molecular pathway responsible for this dysfunction, the team identified a potential method to restore lung healing.

This model allows them to test potential therapies in a controlled environment, providing a crucial step toward developing new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also studied &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/cutting-edge-ai-platform-significantly-improves-lung-cancer-diagnosis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lung organoids&lt;/a&gt;—miniature, simplified versions of organs grown from patient tissues. They found that cells missing the ZIP8 protein, which helps transport zinc into the cell, failed to regenerate and form colonies as healthy cells should. This highlighted ZIP8’s essential role in lung repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The organoids with AEC2 cells that had the ZIP8 transporter were able to draw zinc into the cells, and then were able to regenerate and form more colonies,” said Carol Liang, MD, MBA, associate professor of Medicine and first author of the study. “The cells without ZIP8 didn’t have a way to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/zinc-can-improve-crop-yields-and-climate-resilience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;draw zinc in&lt;/a&gt;, so they formed fewer colonies.

When they fed these mice a diet that included zinc supplements, their fibrosis improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There have been few detailed studies of how &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-reveal-significant-link-between-zinc-levels-and-type-2-diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;zinc works in the lungs&lt;/a&gt;,” said Dianhua Jiang, MD, PhD, professor of Medicine at Cedars-Sinai and co-senior author of the study. “Ours is the first to identify the detailed function of zinc in lung biology, specifically in IPF. It was particularly exciting to discover that zinc regulates the production of two other key molecules that promote tissue regeneration, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and Sirtuin1.

			&lt;p&gt;The hypertension drug &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilmenidine"&gt;rilmenidine&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to slow down aging in worms, an effect that in humans could hypothetically help us live longer and keep us healthier in our latter years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has shown rilmenidine mimics the effects of caloric restriction on a cellular level. Reducing available energy while maintaining nutrition within the body has been shown to extend lifespans &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24146-z"&gt;in several animal models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether this translates to human biology, or is a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/skipping-meals-could-be-much-worse-for-you-than-we-realized"&gt;potential risk to our health&lt;/a&gt;, is a topic of &lt;a href="https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2020/can-calorie-restriction-extend-your-lifespan/"&gt;ongoing debate&lt;/a&gt;. Finding ways to achieve the same benefits without the costs of extreme calorie cutting could lead to new ways to improve health in old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a study published in 2023, young and old &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; worms treated with the drug – which is normally used to treat high blood pressure – lived longer and presented higher measures in a variety of health markers in the same way as restricting calories, as the scientists had hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For the first time, we have been able to show in animals that rilmenidine can increase lifespan," &lt;a href="https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2023/01/23/hypertension-drug-could-be-repurposed-to-delay-ageing-study-finds/"&gt;said molecular biogerontologist João Pedro Magalhães&lt;/a&gt;, from the University of Birmingham in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are now keen to explore if rilmenidine may have other clinical applications."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; worm is a favorite for studies, because many of its genes have similarities to counterparts in our genome. Yet in spite of these similarities, it is still a rather distant relation to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144581" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144581" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/SizeAndMorphologyCElegansCellsComparedToHumanCells642.jpg" alt="Various cell types illustrated in shades of pink" class="size-full wp-image-144581" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/SizeAndMorphologyCElegansCellsComparedToHumanCells642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/SizeAndMorphologyCElegansCellsComparedToHumanCells642-600x334.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144581" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Some human cell types and their nuclei on the left, compared to cells from &lt;em&gt;C. elegans &lt;/em&gt;on the right. (&lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:C_elegans_cell_and_nucleus_sizes.svg"&gt;J.J.Froehlich/CC BY-SA 4.0/Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further tests showed that gene activity associated with caloric restriction could be seen in the kidney and liver tissues of mice treated with rilmenidine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, some of the changes that caloric restriction gives in animals and thought to confer certain health benefits also appear with a hypertension drug that many people already take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another discovery was that a biological signaling receptor called nish-1 was crucial in the effectiveness of rilmenidine. This particular chemical structure could be targeted in future attempts to improve lifespan and slow down aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found that the lifespan-extending effects of rilmenidine were abolished when nish-1 was deleted," the researchers explained in their &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.13774"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Critically, rescuing the nish-1 receptor reinstated the increase in lifespan upon treatment with rilmenidine."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-calorie diets are hard to follow and come with a variety of side effects, such as hair thinning, dizziness, and brittle bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's early days still, but the thinking is that this hypertension drug could confer the same benefits as a low-calorie diet while being easier on the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141684" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141684" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642.jpg" alt="A man sitting on a couch taking his blood pressure" class="size-full wp-image-141684" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141684" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Rilmenidine is normally used to treat high blood pressure. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEwj7ICt3Y/"&gt;Prostock-studio/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes rilmenidine a promising candidate as an anti-aging drug is that it can be taken orally, it's already widely prescribed, and its side effects are rare and relatively mild (they include palpitations, insomnia, and drowsiness in a few cases).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a long way to go yet in figuring out if rilmenidine would work as an anti-aging drug for actual humans, but the early signs in these worm and mice tests are promising. We now know much more about what rilmenidine can do, and how it operates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With a global aging population, the benefits of delaying aging, even if slightly, are immense," &lt;a href="https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2023/01/23/hypertension-drug-could-be-repurposed-to-delay-ageing-study-finds/"&gt;said Magalhães&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.13774"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aging Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i data-stringify-type="italic"&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in January 2023.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A component found in all fungi may provide a shield that prevents flu-related lung damage, according to a new Canadian study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preclinical trial uncovered how beta-glucan—which is found in all mushrooms, and also yeast, oats, and barley—can ‘reprogram’ immune cells to prevent lung inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team of scientists at the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, demonstrated that administering the compound to mice before their exposure to influenza, reduced lung damage, improve lung function and lowered the risk of illness and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists led by Professor Maziar Divangahi discovered that a unique structure of this component can boost defenses against pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most research focuses on stopping the virus from replicating, this study explored how to regulate the body’s immunity to infection, a concept known as “disease tolerance.” The researchers discovered that beta-glucan significantly enhanced flu survival rates by modulating immune responses and preventing severe lung inflammation, a common cause of fatality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-024-02041-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published in Nature Immunology&lt;/a&gt;, highlight beta-glucan as a promising therapy for influenza, as well as other emerging viral pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is remarkable how beta-glucan can reprogram certain immune cells, such as neutrophils, to control excessive inflammation in the lung,” &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/new-discovery-could-help-protect-against-influenza-363625" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said first author&lt;/a&gt; Nargis Khan, who conducted this research at McGill and is now an Assistant Professor at the University of Calgary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Neutrophils are traditionally known for causing inflammation, but beta-glucan has the ability to shift their role to reduce it,” added co-first author Kim Tran, who recently completed her Ph.D. at McGill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHECK OUT&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="The Medicinal Value of Chaga Mushrooms as a Nutraceutical for Good Health" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/the-medicinal-value-of-chaga-mushrooms-as-a-nutraceutical-for-good-health/" rel="bookmark"&gt;The Medicinal Value of Chaga Mushrooms as a Nutraceutical for Good Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rebalancing the immune system&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most flu-related deaths aren’t caused by the virus itself, but by an overreaction of the immune system, said the researchers. This suggests the true danger lies in the host’s own immune response. However, how the immune system becomes so imbalanced remains poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Beta-glucan is found in the cell walls of all fungi, including some that live in and on our bodies as part of the human microbiome,” explained Divangahi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is tempting to hypothesize that the levels and composition of fungi in an individual could influence how their immune system responds to infections, in part because of beta-glucan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With flu season underway and the looming threat of bird flu (H5N1), developing effective therapeutic strategies for respiratory diseases is more critical than ever, he added.&lt;/p&gt;

It refers to the fat stored deep within your abdominal cavity, surrounding essential organs like the liver, pancreas and intestines. And when it comes to visceral fat, it’s not about appearance; reducing it is truly about protecting your well-being. That’s where your diet comes into play. Some foods may make a huge difference when it comes to managing visceral fat and supporting overall health. Among the many nutritional powerhouses out there, one protein-rich food stands out for its unique benefits—&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-pistachios-regularly-8687923" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pistachios&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unlike the fat just beneath your skin, visceral fat isn’t visible, making it tricky to detect. And not because you can’t see it means it doesn’t affect you. In fact, this type of fat can significantly impact your health. Excess visceral fat has been linked to a higher risk of several serious health conditions, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes and even certain types of cancers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Data supports the notion that eating pistachios might be linked to reduced visceral fat. One study published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; showed that when people with at least one risk factor for metabolic syndrome snacked on tree nuts (like pistachios) instead of typical carbohydrate-heavy snacks (like chips or cookies) for 16 weeks, improvements in measures of visceral fat were observed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But what makes them one of the best choices for reducing visceral fat?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-pistachios-support-visceral-fat-reduction"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Pistachios Support Visceral Fat Reduction &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Let’s be clear—no single food will reduce visceral fat, especially if you are not making appropriate overall dietary and lifestyle changes that support this outcome. But if you are taking steps to minimize this dangerous type of abdominal fat, including pistachios in the mix may help you see the results you want to see. Here are four reasons why dietitians recommend pistachios as a top pick for a visceral fat-reducing diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Rich in Healthy Fats &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Pistachios are one of the best foods for reducing visceral fat, partly thanks to their rich content of healthy fats. “Pistachios are a good source of healthy fat, namely unsaturated fatty acids, which are considered cardioprotective. Saturated fats, on the other hand, are implicated in increasing the risk of cardiovascular problems and potentially additional visceral fat buildup,” shares &lt;a href="https://www.amandagodmannutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amanda Godman, M.S., RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats found in pistachios play a crucial role in combating unhealthy fat accumulation. Monounsaturated fats, for instance, help improve lipid profiles by lowering LDL (known as “bad”) cholesterol while increasing HDL (known as “good”) cholesterol levels. This enhances overall cardiovascular health, which is closely linked to maintaining a healthy body weight and reducing abdominal fat. Additionally, these fats help regulate insulin sensitivity, a key factor in preventing visceral fat storage, as unchecked insulin resistance can lead to fat buildup around the abdomen.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Data shows that consuming monounsaturated fat instead of saturated fat is linked to not only a reduction in body fat but also a difference in where fat is stored. In a 2022 study, when people ate a diet rich in saturated fat, most of the fat they gained was deposited in the abdomen as visceral fat. Those who followed a monounsaturated fat-rich diet lost weight and did not accumulate fat as visceral fat in the same way.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Packed With Protein &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A single ounce of pistachios provides roughly 6 grams of protein, making them one of the most &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/nuts-and-seeds-ranked-by-protein-8423784" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein-rich nuts&lt;/a&gt;. Protein plays a role in fat loss as it boosts energy expenditure through the thermic effect of food (TEF), meaning your body burns more calories digesting and metabolizing protein than fats or carbohydrates.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Additionally, consuming high-protein foods like pistachios helps preserve lean muscle mass during weight loss, ensuring that the body prioritizes burning visceral fat rather than muscle tissue.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Data published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Gerontology&lt;/em&gt; showed that, among older men, consuming more protein may be linked to decreased visceral abdominal fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Abundant in Antioxidants &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Antioxidants play a role in combating oxidative stress and inflammation, which are both linked to visceral fat accumulation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Among the powerful antioxidants in pistachios are lutein, beta-carotene and polyphenols. These compounds help neutralize free radicals in the body, reducing cellular damage and promoting overall metabolic health. Studies have shown that diets rich in antioxidants can support better fat metabolism and improve insulin sensitivity, both of which are essential for minimizing visceral fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Data published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrition Research&lt;/em&gt; suggest the possible benefit of an antioxidant diet in relieving visceral obesity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Low In Calories &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Pistachios can support fat loss and metabolic health due to their lower calorie density (160 calories per ounce versus 180–200 in other nuts),” shares &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johannahkatz/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Johannah Katz, M.A., RD&lt;/a&gt;, an Orlando-based registered dietitian.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This balance of high-protein and low-calorie density makes pistachios an ideal choice for those seeking to reduce visceral fat while enjoying a tasty and convenient snack.

It involves replacing the cloudy lens inside the eye with an artificial one to improve vision. One in three people over 65 have cataracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;More than half of NHS cataract procedures in England are outsourced to private providers as part of a collaboration between the NHS and the ­private sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="5.4"&gt;&lt;div id="acf5bfcf-91df-4d16-b79d-ddfb9596d7ee"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Cataract surgery is the most common operation in the NHS, with more than 400,000 people having procedures each year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GOC/GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Optegra, which runs 17 NHS hospitals and clinics, conducted 50,000 NHS cataract operations last year. Alastair Stuart, the Optegra medical director and a consultant ophthalmic surgeon, said: “Normally after a cataract removal procedure, patients leave with a rather intense drop regime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“They have four different types of drops which they need to take three or four times a day, for up to four weeks. This is quite a commitment and hassle for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Due to medical advances we are now able to apply a steroid injection as part of the surgical procedure, which eliminates the need for any drops whatsoever. This is revolutionary for patients’ post-operative care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“On top of this, we provide treatment for both eyes on the same day. While we do this regularly for private patients, the normal pathway for NHS patients is to have one eye treated and then return several weeks later for the second eye.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/nhs-waiting-list-pilot-ai-patient-risk-score-mw2v0pc76" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;App spots patients at risk and moves them up the NHS waiting list&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Stuart explained that the imbalance between the eyes in the weeks between surgeries can “be quite uncomfortable and make people feel unsteady”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He added: “By treating both eyes on one day the patient leaves with excellent vision in both eyes, which immediately decreases the risk of falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“By completing the pre-operative ­diagnostic tests and consultation on the day of treatment, patients have been delighted to reduce the number of visits to the hospital, especially if they have a distance to travel and are relying on friends or family to be available — also as the patient cannot drive themselves home.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;While each of these elements have been successfully carried out before, this is the first time all three have been offered to patients at once. Five patients were treated at the Hampshire clinic last week as part of the trial, with hundreds more due to participate this month. Drop-free surgery will also be rolled out to all NHS patients at ­Optegra clinics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Those benefiting include Jim Hayles, 70, from Southampton, who said: “Two eyes at the same time means I do not have to worry about having two ops and two lots of everything, so yes, that’s great. I’ve also been told that normally you would have drops for four weeks, at different times of day, so you have to remember to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“This procedure means you don’t have to have drops at all, which is going to be brilliant because I can just walk out of here and within a day or two, take the covers off and that’s it. I don’t have to worry about anything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Maria Walmsey, 78, from Waterlooville, Hampshire, has struggled with reading and cooking because of her ­cataracts. She said: “It’s got progressively worse and impacts on everyday life, in everything you are doing — whether hobbies or just in general. My &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/health-jvqwk3rgd" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;sight&lt;/a&gt; became blurry and it’s there all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“The thought of coming in one day and having everything done in both eyes is obviously beneficial. Not backwards and forwards to the hospital, it saves time, it’s more convenient, and in the space of one day I get my sight back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Peter Boyle, 73, from Fareham, said. “To have all the measurements and test on the same day as the surgery is an absolute bonus for me — initially I thought I was going to have one eye done and come back for the other three months later. This is a brilliant method of having cataract surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 20:10:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNM096V09HQmhXUnUxRmxTaUtzY19xZWkwZFVmQmVka0dHQ1J6dUlxVTA5TFlkRWRGU2xkeUlDX2NhM2F1SVRRamFCZlUxNE1WLVdiRS14VU5ncWh0MTluOEs3M3V3bjU0aWF4eUZUWjlmUEE2MUVNcDNrMmFONTZuRXNFVHFZa2VKTlpkSi1Ja21DWUpTQ2JwX2ZNUUZIaHhpQmlQdmhJbXhldW1UN3VF</guid></item><item><title>Your Wife Is Most Likely To Cheat With This Out Of Left-Field Person, According To Research - YourTango</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTFB4NWEyajAyY0FVcTVXelZROXFOYnI3X3hsVmVHeFhlaEs0YWFtN3phTlRwUWVfOUNkdFNESEwwejJKZ3paQkNOZF94RWdxb2pVUDRBQ3A4SDVEanZpbUV0UTVTbjBnNnYtQkVjendIMFRkSGN6dUZUNQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;According to research, your wife is mostly likely to cheat with a same-sex partner.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women are more likely than men to cheat on their spouses with a same-sex partner, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10002055/#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20research%20has%20shown,past%20few%20decades%20%5B18%5D." rel="nofollow"&gt;studies suggest&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not that women are more likely to be homosexual or bisexual — it’s that women appear more willing than men to change their minds about what turns them on, throughout their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men tend to choose a sexuality and stick with it, experts agree. Women are wildcards. And it's this fluidity that can sometimes complicate relationships, &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/heartbreak/behaviors-that-cause-divorces"&gt;contributing to divorce&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-03/women-cheat-on-you-this-person.png" alt="Your Wife Is Most Likely To Cheat With This Out Of Left-Field Person, According To Research" title="Your Wife Is Most Likely To Cheat With This Out Of Left-Field Person, According To Research" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;bbernard / Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think data are sufficient to suggest that more women are likely to change their reported sexual orientation depending on their circumstance, whereas men are more resistant to changing their identity from intimate behavior alone,” &lt;a href="https://sprweb.org/nicole-prause/" rel="nofollow"&gt;psychophysiologist and neuroscientist Nicole Prause&lt;/a&gt; explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phrase “&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/sex/sexuality-fluid-embrace"&gt;sexual fluidity&lt;/a&gt;” was originally coined by &lt;a href="https://psych.utah.edu/people/faculty/diamond-lisa.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;psychologist Lisa Diamond&lt;/a&gt; in 2008. After following the same 100 women for a decade, she found that there were crucial differences between bisexuality and the sexual fluidity that otherwise heterosexual women experienced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/heartbreak/sad-but-common-signs-your-marriage-already-over"&gt;12 Sad But Common Signs Your Marriage Is Already Over&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/experts/dr-lori-bisbey/am-i-bisexual-what-being-bisexual-really-means-to-me-at-least"&gt;Bisexuality is defined as&lt;/a&gt; being attracted to men and women. Many women, Diamond found, identified as gay or straight, but accepted the fact that they might change their minds at some point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When experts say that women are more likely to be fluid, they mean that they’re more likely to make an exception to, or even update, their identities. &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this does not mean that women are more likely than men to cheat on their spouses and fluidity is seldom the main cause of a relationship souring. As with any relationship problem, there are usually other, &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/signs-someone-problem-relationship-even-though-they-pretend-not-to-be"&gt;deeper relationship issues&lt;/a&gt; at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="player-wrapper-outer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, more than ever, married women are stepping away from problem heterosexual marriages, and into same-sex ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have seen a mild increase in my practice of women in their 30s over the last decade,” &lt;a href="https://www.uhhospitals.org/doctors/Kingsberg-Sheryl-1861418675" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sheryl Kingsberg&lt;/a&gt;, a professor and division chief of behavioral medicine in the OB/GYN unit at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center told In Style. “Maybe it’s hormonal, maybe it’s neuroendocrine — an epigenetic shift in brain chemistry that is hormone-based. But it’s certainly a shift.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hormonal explanation may be that women’s testosterone levels increase with age, and higher testosterone levels &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3138231/#:~:text=Exposure%20to%20a%20high%20concentration%20of%20testosterone,to%20a%20female%2Dtypical%20orientation%20(attraction%20to%20men)." rel="nofollow"&gt;have also been linked&lt;/a&gt; with an increased incidence of homosexuality and bisexuality in women. &lt;a href="https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/87097/13/Kanazawa_Possible_evolutionary_origins_of_human_female_sexual_fluidity_AAM.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;According to psychological theories,&lt;/a&gt; this might help explain why women may be more fluid in their thirties and forties, after having kids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/2024377641/when-shes-about-cheat-she-does-these-things"&gt;The 4 Silent 'Tells' A Woman Is About To Cheat And Blow Up Her Marriage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Evolutionary psychologists have offered several theories as to why women may be more fluid as well, such as an adaptive way to decrease conflict in polygamous cultures.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10825779/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Another popular explanation&lt;/a&gt; is that, because saying yes to intimacy comes at a higher risk and reproductive cost to women, they tend to make decisions more cautiously on a case-by-case basis, which could potentially allow for more deviation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, likely, increased rates of fluidity among women are primarily a social (rather than biological) phenomenon. Indeed, there is emerging evidence that men have the same potential as women to be fluid, but that stigma prevents them from acting upon it. In most Western societies, women still face fewer social costs for same-sex relationships than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know if one gender is more fluid than the other,” clinical social worker Alisha Powell Powell explained. “But I think that one is much more widely accepted than the other.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="player-wrapper-outer-mobile"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/heartbreak/bizarre-way-discovered-wife-having-affair-inside-home"&gt;The Bizarre Way I Discovered My Wife Was Having An Affair Inside Our Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lauren Vinopal is a freelance journalist who writes about health and science.

&lt;p&gt;A Howard County resident tested positive for measles after returning from international travel, according to the Maryland Department of Health and Howard County health officials. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officials say the measles case is not associated with the measles outbreak in Texas and New Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyone who visited the following locations during the following hours may have been exposed: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Washington Dulles International Airport: The international arrivals area&lt;br&gt;March 5th: 4 p.m. - 9 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Johns Hopkins Howard County Medical Center Pediatric Emergency Department&lt;br&gt;March 7th: 3:30 p.m. - 7:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Virginia Department of Health, the Maryland Department of Health and Howard County health officials are looking to identify people who might have been exposed, including contacting potentially exposed passengers on specific flights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who may have been exposed should contact their healthcare provider for additional guidance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also call Howard County Health Department’s Infectious Disease Surveillance and Response Program at 410-313-6284 or the Virginia Department Health at (804) 363-2704 or email epi_response@vdh.virginia.gov.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once you have your plump, firm, unwilted, and vibrant asparagus washed and ready to go, let’s study up on some of the most common stalk mistakes so you can steer clear of them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block allrecipes-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme figure-landscape figure-high-res"&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to the chefs we spoke with, try to avoid the following common faux pas:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Letting it get parched.&lt;/strong&gt; For maximum flavor and the best texture, it’s ideal to cook your asparagus as soon as possible after you pick it from the garden or the supermarket. If you plan to cook it later, don’t &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-store-asparagus/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;store&lt;/a&gt; it dry. Instead, keep it like you would with flowers. Trim the ends and place the asparagus, spears up, in a jar that has about half an inch of water. Cover loosely with a plastic bag, and change the water daily. Alternatively, wrap the trimmed ends in a damp paper towel, tuck the asparagus in a plastic bag, and store them in your refrigerator’s &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/what-is-a-crisper-drawer/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;crisper drawer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skipping the trim.&lt;/strong&gt; The most common mistake home cooks make related to asparagus is forgetting to trim the stems, says Chef Mary Payne Moran of Los Angeles. The stem can be extremely tough, woody, and not very tasty, adds cookbook author Yumna Jawad of Grand Rapids. Plan on cutting off about 1 to 2 inches from the bottom of the spears or at the point where stalks change from green to pale green or white. If the stalks are extremely thick at the ends, consider using a vegetable peeler to shave off the outermost layer or two, says Chef Adam Fiscus of New York City. Save any trimmed pieces for &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-make-vegetable-stock-out-of-kitchen-scraps/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;vegetable stock&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooking low and slow.&lt;/strong&gt; Asparagus can handle the heat, Jawad confirms. Don’t be afraid to crank things up to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) when roasting or grilling, or even 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) if you like charred edges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepping it wet.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re cooking asparagus in any other way besides steaming or blanching, it's crucial to dry the asparagus well after washing. “If it has too much moisture on it, it will likely steam instead of cooking as you intended, so make sure to pat it dry well to get the best texture,” Jawad explains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-best-way-to-cook-asparagus-according-to-chefs"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block allrecipes-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Best Way to Cook Asparagus, According to Chefs &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You have quite a few choices when it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipes/1079/fruits-and-vegetables/vegetables/asparagus/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cooking asparagus&lt;/a&gt;, so it can be challenging to choose. Should you &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/49439/the-best-steamed-asparagus/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;steam in the microwave&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/266394/air-fryer-asparagus-fries/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;air-fry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/223427/parmesan-asparagus/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;bake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/214931/oven-roasted-asparagus/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;roast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/18318/pan-fried-asparagus/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="6"&gt;pan-fry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/220715/deep-fried-asparagus/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="7"&gt;deep-fry&lt;/a&gt;, or try another technique? We polled the pros, and one method blew the competition out of the water. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If they were forced to choose just one way to ensure asparagus doesn't become soggy, the chefs recommend &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/how-to-make-best-roasted-asparagus-8621524" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;roasting&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block allrecipes-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme figure-landscape figure-high-res"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block allrecipes-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Roasting &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even though asparagus is a vegetable, it contains some natural sugars, which caramelize when roasted, Jawad notes. This lends nuttiness and slightly sweeter flavor, plus each stalk can cook evenly—and with very little fuss. If you allow enough space between the stalks, “there is no watery residue, and the bite is crunchy with a hint of chew,” Moran explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Roasting deepens the flavor so the tips get a bit crispy, plus it’s also easy,” says cookbook author Peter Som of New York City.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Heat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Toss washed and trimmed asparagus with 1 tablespoon oil per pound, season with salt and black pepper, then evenly space out the stalks in a single layer on a parchment paper-lined sheet pan. Moran suggests avoiding pans that are very dark in color, as this can lead to uneven cooking. Roast for 10 to 12 minutes, or until slightly golden brown and the thickest part of the asparagus is fork-tender.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Grilling, blanching, and steaming in the microwave all deserve honorable mentions and will certainly satisfy depending on your goals and personal preferences.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block allrecipes-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Grilling &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For results similar to roasting but achievable al fresco, Fiscus is fond of grilling. “Asparagus cooked this way looks great and tastes amazing, adding elegance to any plated protein dish,” he explains. It’s also versatile. As a tip, Fiscus likes to &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/19620/easy-and-tasty-all-purpose-marinade/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;marinate&lt;/a&gt; his vegetables for 30 minutes to a few hours to infuse each bite with extra flavor. Still, grilling didn’t get quite as many upvotes because it requires more gear and optimal weather…or a really warm coat and some thick skin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Heat your grill to high, or around 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Toss washed and trimmed asparagus with 1 tablespoon oil or vinaigrette per pound, season with salt and black pepper, then add the asparagus in a single layer on the grill grates. Cook, turning often with tongs, until lightly charred and fork-tender (about 3 to 5 minutes).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block allrecipes-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme figure-landscape figure-high-res"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block allrecipes-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Blanching &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It might be a bit ho-hum to enjoy on its own as a side dish. However, if you plan to put your cooked asparagus to use in salads or crudité platters, blanching is a brilliant option, Som says. “You’ll get the bright green color with that tender crisp texture,” he explains, which pairs perfectly with a &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8391899/apple-cider-vinaigrette/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bright vinaigrette&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/286167/instant-pot-jammy-eggs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;jammy egg&lt;/a&gt;, or your favorite &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/most-saved-dip-recipe-8775965" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;dip recipe&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To blanch asparagus, bring a pot of water to a boil. Add washed and trimmed asparagus stalks to the water and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, erring on the longer side for thicker asparagus. Once the color appears even more vibrant, use tongs or a slotted spoon to transfer the blanched asparagus to a bowl of ice water. Chill for 2 minutes, then remove, pat dry, and enjoy as desired.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block allrecipes-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Steaming in the Microwave &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Director of Culinary Matt Larkin of New York City admits, “My secret asparagus tip is to microwave it.” True, it might sound like a humble shortcut, but steaming gives the spears a crisp-tender quality similar to blanching—but without waiting for a pot of water to boil and preparing an ice bath. It leaps and bounds above boiling, according to Moran, since you don’t end up with the wet residue that tends to occur post-boil. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Wash and trim the asparagus, then place it in a single layer on a plate. Cover the stalks with a damp paper towel, then microwave for about 3 minutes, or until the center is tender when you pierce it with a knife.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With all these methods, you're now equipped for a season full of delicious asparagus.&lt;br&gt;

She then met with Dr. Mark Lewis, director of gastrointestinal oncology at Intermountain Health, and told him she was concerned about the side effects of chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, she was eligible for another type of treatment: immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of patients, understandably, when you tell them they require chemotherapy, will refuse it, so it is incredibly appealing to patients that we now have another option to treat cancer, and that's immunotherapy," Lewis said. "The entire point is to turn on the immune system and allow the patient's own body to destroy the cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone is a candidate for immunotherapy, and Lewis noted with this kind of treatment, there is a risk of developing an autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not going to pretend that these treatments have absolutely no side effects, but for the most part, these treatments are far more tolerable than chemotherapy," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brinley went in for an IV every three weeks for two years. She experienced nausea at first but said she had no other side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was very successful, and I'm in remission," she said. "I feel great. I feel really good. Strong and healthy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her cancer journey hasn't been easy, but she has remained positive, focusing on her family and her religion. She's now encouraging others to make their health a priority, especially since she didn't experience any signs or symptoms before being diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Eva Brinley rings a bell signifying she has finished her cancer treatment. (Photo: Eva Brinley)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just can't stress enough how important it is to do those checkups," she said. "Stay healthy. Eat right. Have your checkups, and be aware."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths and the third most commonly diagnosed cancer. While some people may not have any symptoms, like Eva, warning signs of colon cancer may include persistent or progressive abdominal pain, changes in bowel movements, such as constipation or diarrhea, blood in the stool and unintentional weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts recommend people at average risk of colon cancer begin screening at age 45.

    &lt;p&gt;There have never been more supplements on the supermarket shelves, or in our kitchen cupboards, as millions of us strive for better health and hope to achieve it through consuming a pill or powder. Around two-thirds of adults in the UK &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/supplements/supplements-worth-taking1/"&gt;take some form of supplement&lt;/a&gt; – that’s the equivalent of 81 million supplements a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Made by isolating nutrients from plants and animals, whether we’re looking for improved immunity, increased energy or better sleep, it’s easy to treat supplements as medicines. But they’re not, and they’re not regulated like medicines either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, food supplements are regulated under the Food Supplements (England) Regulations 2003, which align with EU and UK food laws. They must comply with general food safety legislation and cannot make misleading health claims. But, unlike medicines, supplements are not as strictly regulated and do not undergo the same rigorous testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while most supplements should be safe, whether or not they do what they say on the tin is another question. The fact that what’s available online might be from abroad and outside UK and EU rules, alongside the statistic that four in five consumers never check the ingredients label anyway, and you might be wondering just how to tell if that pricey supplement you picked up is going to do you any good at all…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First things first – are pricey supplements the answer? The marketing of some luxury supplements – think Lyma, where a 30-day supply of their signature supplement aimed at improving sleep, lowering stress and increasing skin and hair health costs £199 – suggests more money spent means a more effective supplement. But prices for what seem to be the same product can vary wildly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/supplements/magnesium-health-benefits-body-supplements-immunity/"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; as an example. At Holland &amp;amp; Barrett, a bottle of 30 tablets containing 375mg per tablet costs £3.99, or 13p per tablet. If you choose Inessa Magnesium, you’ll get 60 capsules containing 153mg per capsule for £24.99 – working out at around 42p per tablet, for less than half the dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These pills both contain slightly different combinations of types and sources of magnesium, so it depends on what you’re looking for, and while sometimes, price point does indicate a better product, this is not always the case, insist the experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Marketing plays a massive role in supplement pricing,” says Nichola Ludlam-Raine a registered specialist dietitian. “This can create a perception that they are far superior to cheaper alternatives, even if the core ingredients are the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In many cases, high street own-brand supplements can be just as effective as premium supplement brands. The key factors to consider are the ingredients, dosages, and third-party testing rather than branding alone. I often suggest my patients choose supermarket own brand supplements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What are you paying for when you buy more expensive supplements?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you buy premium supplements, you’re often paying for branding and marketing. “Luxury supplement brands invest heavily in high-end packaging, influencer partnerships, and advertising.” These, of course, make no difference to how good the product is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are other reasons too. “Some premium brands use patented or trademarked versions of vitamins and minerals,” explains Ludlam-Raine, which may have enhanced bioavailability (better absorption) or research backing, and are therefore worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“High-end brands may combine multiple beneficial ingredients into one formula, such as added adaptogens, nootropics, or probiotics, which could be worth paying extra for, if you want them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She explains: “Some premium brands undergo more rigorous third-party testing to ensure purity, potency, and absence of contaminants.” But as with any supplement, you must check if this is the case – don’t assume that the price point means these tests have been done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If a high-street supplement has the same form and dosage of an active ingredient as a luxury brand, it can be just as effective,” says Ludlam-Raine. “Ultimately, it’s important to read labels, check dosages, and choose reputable brands rather than relying solely on price as an indicator of quality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The NHS recommends most people should get their nutrients from food, but some groups may need supplements, including those where a health care professional has said that there is a deficiency – which can be determined via a blood test,’”explains Ludlam-Raine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ludlam-Raine recommends following the NHS advice on vitamin D, folic acid, calcium, vitamin B12, iodine, iron, and &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/cheap-vital-why-omega-3-helps-you-live-longer/"&gt;omega-3&lt;/a&gt; in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone should &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/vitamin-d-deficiency-signs-symptoms/"&gt;supplement with vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; daily during the winter months (taking 10mcg/400IU from October to March), or all year round if you are: pregnant or breastfeeding, over 65, have darker skin or spend very little time outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Folic acid&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are pregnant, have diabetes, a &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/weight-loss/bmi-calculator/"&gt;BMI&lt;/a&gt; over 30, or take certain epilepsy medications, you should supplement with folic acid. Take 5mg daily at least three months before pregnancy and for the first 12 weeks to prevent neural tube defects, or take 5mg daily if you belong to any of the other groups mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Vitamin B12, calcium, iron, iodine, and omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vegans and those who avoid animal products may want to consider taking a supplement that provides these nutrients, which are not available from non-animal products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re unsure, speak to a GP, pharmacist, or registered dietitian before taking supplements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;1. Look for a clear ingredient list&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ingredients list should be transparent and detailed,” says Dr Amos Ogunkoya, a GP and sports and exercise medic. It should include the specific form of the vitamins and minerals included, as well as the amount. (For example, if your supplement contains vitamin A as beta-carotene, that is safe in pregnancy – whereas vitamin A in the form of retinol is not, points out Ludlam-Raine.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;2. Check the dose is correct&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Staying with the NHS guidance on upper limits is key,’ says Ludlam-Raine. The recommended limits are listed on their &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. Equally, check if there is actually a reasonable amount of your recommended daily allowance in the supplement, says Dr Ogunkoya – something might highlight a certain popular vitamin or mineral on the front of the packet but contain a relatively small amount, he warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;3. Choose an evidence-based formulation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means its claims have been third-party tested or the dosage matches what’s proven in clinical studies, advises Dr Ogunkoya, as well as that the nutrients are present in their most bioavailable form, says Ludlam-Raine. “For example, there are two forms of vitamin D available in supplements: D3 and D2. Both can help correct vitamin D deficiency, but most doctors recommend D3 because it is slightly more active and therefore slightly more effective,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;4. Check the certificate of analysis of the products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means it has been lab-tested to prove that it meets the criteria advertised on the ingredients list. It should be on the supplement website – if not, email and ask about it, says Dr Ogunkoya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;5. Look for a mark of regulation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, look for products registered with the Food Standard Agency, says Ludlam-Raine, or the very few registered with the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another worthwhile thing to look at is whether it has an Informed Sport logo, which assures professional athletes that the product is regularly tested for banned substances as well as meeting top-quality standards, says Dr Ogunkoya, who also works with an app called SafeSupp which allows consumers to scan supplement labels to assess the quality of their ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Also look for:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;6. Absorption-enhancing combinations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some vitamins and minerals enhance each other, while others reduce absorption, says Ludlam-Raine. So good combined products to look for include &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/vitamin-d-deficiency-signs-symptoms/"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; and calcium (vitamin D aids calcium absorption); vitamin C and iron (vitamin C boosts iron absorption, especially if the iron is from a plant-based source); and magnesium and vitamin D (magnesium helps activate vitamin D in the body).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;7. Money-back guarantees&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’ll find trustworthy brands stand behind their products,” says Dr Ogunkoya. “They don’t want to lose money, so offering a guarantee on a supplement should show they are confident it will be effective, and safe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as a huge variety of supplements on the market, there is an ever-widening and increasingly inventive array of forms they come in. Whether you prefer to take them as pills, capsules, sprays, or gummies – all can be effective, but some are better absorbed than others, says Ludlam-Raine:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sprays are good for vitamin D (absorbed via the mouth).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gummies may contain added sugars and fewer active ingredients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Capsules can be easier to swallow than tablets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Patches and skin creams are generally less reliable for nutrient absorption.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;1. Avoid ‘megadoses’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can have too much of a good thing.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Some vitamins (A, D, E, K) are fat-soluble and can build up in the body, leading to toxicity,” says Ludlam-Raine. “Excess iron should also be avoided unless prescribed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;2. Watch out for proprietary blends&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are combined supplements where the exact nutrient amounts aren’t listed. It’s a bit like KFC’s secret blend of herbs and spices, but what the colonel does to stop competitors copying his flavour may, when it comes to supplements, be done to ‘hide’ what’s actually in the supplement and use cheaper ingredients and less beneficial doses, says Dr Ogunkoya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;3. Poor bioavailability&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some cheap brands use forms of vitamins that aren’t well absorbed, because it costs less,” says Ludlam-Raine. See vitamin D, above. Or in the case of calcium: “Calcium citrate is better absorbed than calcium carbonate by approximately 22 to 27 per cent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;4. Combinations that cancel each other out&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/best-foods-iron-levels/"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; and calcium. Calcium blocks iron absorption, so take them separately at different times, says Ludlam-Raine. ‘If taking multiple supplements, space them out throughout the day to increase absorption or check with a healthcare professional.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;5. Avoid ‘filler’ ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are often found in cheaper supplements to pad out to mix. Examples include maltodextrin, a type of artificial sugar, and guar gum, a thickening agent made from guar beans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fillers are added to supplements to help with stability, absorption, or to bulk out the tablet. In general, small amounts of additives are not harmful to health in the context of a healthy diet,’ says Ludlam-Raine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, they don’t add anything beneficial – and in some cases, taken in excess, can cause side effects, says Dr Ogunkoya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how do you recognise a filler? Look out for names such as magnesium stearate (a salt which in high amounts can have laxative effects and impact nutrient absorption), silicon dioxide (a compound of silicon and oxygen, little crystals of which are used as an anti-caking agent), maltodextrin (a binder and artificial sugar which can have a negative influence on the gut microbiome), guar gum (a thickener made from gel-forming fibres within guar beans) and more.&lt;/p&gt;

After all, recent studies show that major shifts like &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39797935/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:switching to a Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;switching to a Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.26804" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:engaging in regular brain training to improve memory and attention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;engaging in regular brain training to improve memory and attention&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047847/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:slashing stress;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;slashing stress&lt;/a&gt; are all excellent ways to boost cognitive health. In addition to these great options, &lt;strong&gt;there's another simple trick to protect your brain: move your body for just five minutes a day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jamda.com/article/S1525-8610(24)00879-X/abstract" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:New research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;New research&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt; found that &lt;strong&gt;as little as 35 minutes total of exercise per week can reduce the chance of dementia over a subsequent four-year timespan by an amazing 41%.&lt;/strong&gt; Even people who aren’t used to any physical exertion at all can gain this benefit with a small amount of movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even better, the researchers found that the more exercise you do, the more your dementia risk drops. For example, out of the 90,000 adults from the United Kingdom who participated in the study, those who did 25 to 60 minutes of exercise a week saw a 60% reduction in risk. The participants who did 70 to 130.9 minutes of exercise a week achieved a 63% lower risk and those who did 140 minutes or more of exercise in seven days accomplished a 69% lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Of course, doing more is better, but the point of the study was to show that any extra movement counts,” says the study's lead author &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3809/amal-asiri-wanigatunga" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amal Wanigatunga, PhD, MPH,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amal Wanigatunga, PhD, MPH,&lt;/a&gt; assistant professor of epidemiology in the Bloomberg School’s department of epidemiology with a joint appointment at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and core faculty member at the Johns Hopkins Center on Aging and Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, nearly 7 million adults in the US have dementia, &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures#:~:text=An%20estimated%206.9%20million%20Americans,prevent%20or%20cure%20Alzheimer's%20disease." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the Alzheimer’s Association reports;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the Alzheimer’s Association reports&lt;/a&gt;.

Additionally, “there is other published evidence showing that exercise is associated with &lt;a href="https://qbi.uq.edu.au/brain-basics/brain-physiology/what-neurogenesis#:~:text=Neurogenesis%20is%20the%20process%20by,birth%20and%20throughout%20our%20lifespan." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neurogenesis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;neurogenesis&lt;/a&gt; and increased brain volume,” says Wanigatunga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What kind of activity works to cut your dementia risk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news: whatever activity you enjoy that raises your heart rate will do the trick. “Our findings suggest anything counts!” says Wanigatunga. “The way we measured moderate to vigorous physical activity was through a wrist-worn electronic monitor that captures all activity types — not just structured exercise. Therefore, the results suggest &lt;strong&gt;any extra movement – which can also include structured exercise – beyond one's usual daily routine that is at a moderate intensity or higher could be beneficial to reduce dementia risk.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means you can fit in your daily movement in short bursts – taking the stairs instead of the elevator, briskly walking the dog, you name it. In the most recent &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (published in 2018), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends that adults get at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per week — an average of a little more than 20 minutes a day. However, this can be tough for some people to manage. “The point of the study was to show any extra movement counts,” assures Wanigatunga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How else can physical activity benefit your brain?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise can help you think better, remember more, have an easier time solving problems and achieve emotional balance, which can help with depression and anxiety, according to information &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity/features/boost-brain-health.html#:~:text=Physical%20activity%20can%20help%20you,of%20cognitive%20decline%2C%20including%20dementia." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:published by the CDC on January 31, 2025;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;published by the CDC on January 31, 2025&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, physical activity also improves the brain functions that affect your hearing. “The brain does not just receive sound; it actively interprets and organizes it, allowing us to focus on conversations, filter out background noise and make sense of complex sounds,” says &lt;a href="https://spauldingrehab.org/physician/1052/daniel-daneshvar" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Daniel Daneshvar, MD, PhD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Daniel Daneshvar, MD, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, co-chair of sports concussion at &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mass General Brigham;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mass General Brigham&lt;/a&gt; and chief of the division of brain injury at &lt;a href="https://spauldingrehab.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Spaulding Rehabilitation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Spaulding Rehabilitation&lt;/a&gt; in Boston and assistant professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is pretty significant, because if you develop hearing trouble between the ages of 40 and 65, &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2023/new-study-links-hearing-loss-with-dementia-in-older-adults" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research shows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; your dementia risk increases. “As we age, changes in brain health can make it harder to process what we hear, even if our ears are still working well,” explains Dr. Daneshvar. &lt;strong&gt;“Regular exercise supports brain function by improving blood flow, strengthening neural connections and reducing inflammation, all of which help maintain cognitive abilities.&lt;/strong&gt; This means that staying physically active may not only protect hearing, but also help preserve the ability to understand speech in noisy environments, react quickly to sounds, and stay engaged in conversations, which are all important for long-term cognitive and social well-being.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;T&lt;strong&gt;he bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working more physical activity in your life can pay off for your brain now and later. “Move as much as possible throughout the day, and add regular exercise sessions for even stronger protection,” Dr. Danesgvar suggests. &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/anatomy-of-the-brain" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Your brain isn’t a muscle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Your brain isn’t a muscle&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s nearly impossible to avoid &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a42790639/what-are-ultra-processed-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ultra-processed foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, given that they make up &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs43016-024-01095-7.epdf&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffood-nutrition%2Fhealthy-eating%2Fa64074545%2Fhow-to-stop-eating-ultra-processed-foods-study%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:70 percent;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of our food supply in America. But these foods have been &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-077310" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:linked;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to serious health problems, from type 2 diabetes to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20065762/obesity-metabolic-syndrome-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:obesity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a61766184/vegan-diet-may-reduce-biological-age-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:faster biological aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;faster biological aging&lt;/a&gt;, so it might be smart to start reassessing your relationship with some of these products. Plus, cutting back on your ultra-processed food intake could help some folks reach a healthier weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While scaling back on all-things ultra-processed is easier said than done, a new scientific study just found that there's actually a pretty simple trick that can help you avoid these foods that works in just eight weeks. Doctors are calling the intervention “effective” and “smart.” Here’s what it involves, plus why it’s worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mir Ali,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mir Ali,&lt;/a&gt; MD, medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA; &lt;a href="https://publichealth.gwu.edu/departments/health-policy-and-management/y-tony-yang" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tony Yang,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tony Yang,&lt;/a&gt; DSc, MPH, professor in the Milken Institute School of Public Health in the Department of Health Policy and Management and associate dean for Health Policy and Population Science at George Washington University; &lt;a href="https://njms-web.njms.rutgers.edu/profile/myProfile.php?mbmid=dhk84" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Danbee Kim;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Danbee Kim&lt;/a&gt;, MD, weight loss surgeon, nutrition expert, and assistant professor at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/osp4.70029" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Obesity Science and Practice;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Obesity Science and Practice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, followed 14 adults with obesity or overweight who usually ate at least two ultra-processed foods a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers had participants follow an eight-week plan that involved weekly educational group sessions and individual meal planning sessions. Those sessions also included information on how to identify ultra-processed foods, why they can be harmful, and strategies for dealing with cravings (which can sometimes occur when cutting back on ultra-processed foods). The participants received financial support in the form of a $100 grocery store gift card, too—all with the goal of helping them identify ultra-processed foods and consume less of them in their diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers had participants complete questionnaires on their diets at the start of the study and again at the end, and they found that participants reduced their ultra-processed foods intake by nearly half. This also led to a reduction in caloric intake from these foods by nearly 49 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, the participants consumed 612 less calories a day, 37 percent less sodium, and 50 percent less sugar. (They didn’t make any big changes to how much fruits or vegetables they ate.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another big stat to keep in mind: The participants lost an average of 7.7 pounds during the eight-week trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why was the program so successful?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have a few theories. Instead of just telling people to "eat healthier," this educational method "provides structured support to navigate a food environment where ultra-processed foods dominate,” says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.gwu.edu/departments/health-policy-and-management/y-tony-yang" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tony Yang,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tony Yang,&lt;/a&gt; DSc, MPH, professor in the Milken Institute School of Public Health in the Department of Health Policy and Management and associate dean for Health Policy and Population Science at George Washington University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mix of education, personalized meal planning, financial assistance, and advice on coping with cravings is a solid combination, Yang says. “In essence, when individuals are equipped with knowledge, practical tools, and support, they are more likely to make sustainable dietary changes,” he says. “It turns out that when ultra-processed foods stop competing for attention, nutrient-dense foods can take center stage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the weight-loss front, ultra-processed foods tend to be high in calories and are really tasty, making them tough to resist, says &lt;a href="https://njms-web.njms.rutgers.edu/profile/myProfile.php?mbmid=dhk84" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Danbee Kim;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Danbee Kim&lt;/a&gt;, MD, weight loss surgeon, nutrition expert, and assistant professor at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. “They encourage overeating and weight gain,” she adds. As a result, it just makes sense that people would lose weight when they cut back on how much of these foods they have, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can I apply these findings to my own life?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, educating yourself about processed foods doesn't always require spending boatloads of cash. Just make sure you stick to vetted sources that rely on trained medical experts. &lt;em&gt;Women's Health &lt;/em&gt;also has its own &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a63592662/ultraprocessed-foods-list/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ultra-processed foods guide;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ultra-processed foods guide&lt;/a&gt; that breaks down the big points, if you're looking for a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to drill down a little more, researchers from Harvard University and Brigham and Women's Hospital just released a website called &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.truefood.tech/__;!!Ivohdkk!nft9loFpT2vkoAso3_kZS0uwva7vdEqWGRic1LHaEPWgvVlKKy1g9622R42IWpY7U9hGp7K0U4zW7qKQYtWESQ$" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TrueFood;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;TrueFood&lt;/a&gt; that allows you to search for the level of processing involved in products sold at popular grocery chains. If you're still having a tough time weeding out ultra-processed foods from their less-processed counterparts, it might be worth having a chat with a registered dietitian, if your budget allows for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes food ultra-processed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All foods are classified by something called the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924224421004970" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NOVA scale;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NOVA scale&lt;/a&gt;, which puts foods into four different categories that denote different levels of processing based on certain features. Here’s a breakdown:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unprocessed and minimally processed foods &lt;/strong&gt;are in their natural state or are barely altered. That includes foods like fresh produce and milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processed culinary ingredients&lt;/strong&gt; are products made through minimal processing, including pressing, grinding, refining, or milling. Olive oil and almond flour fall into this camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processed foods&lt;/strong&gt; are changed from their natural state. They usually have things like sugar, oil, salt, or other ingredients added. Bagged frozen vegetables and canned fish fall are considered processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultra-processed foods&lt;/strong&gt; are processed, with additional ingredients like artificial colors, flavors, additives, and preservatives to add texture and extend the products’ shelf life. These foods are usually packaged, and include things like potato chips, sweetened cereals, and energy drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be tricky to know at first glance which foods are ultra-processed and which aren't. But often, these foods come in a package (instead of say, sitting in the fresh air in the produce aisle). Beyond that, some of the biggest ultra-processed foods include things like sausages, deli meats, salty snacks, packaged cookies, and sodas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is ultra-processed food bad for us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's been a lot of media coverage of the harms of consuming a ton of ultra-processed foods lately. Dr. Kim points out that they have been “linked to serious health risks.” Those &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-077310" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:include;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;include&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the short term, you should also know that these foods are generally not very nutritious and contain higher levels of simple carbohydrates and sugars, says &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mir Ali,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mir Ali,&lt;/a&gt; MD, medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA. That can crowd out more nutritious foods and raise the risk of weight gain, he says. “Carbohydrates and sugars are what we advise that our patients &lt;em&gt;avoid&lt;/em&gt; to help them lose weight,” Dr. Ali adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much ultra-processed food is safe to consume?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no scientifically established consumption limit for these foods at the moment, Yang says. But “research consistently suggests that limiting ultra-processed food intake is beneficial for overall health,” he adds. Said another way: Less is best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why Dr. Kim recommends focusing on whole foods like fruits, vegetables, and nuts, over ultra-processed foods. Dr. Ali also suggests trying to fill your plate with protein sources and vegetables first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not all ultra-processed foods are bad for you. Take, unsweetened almond milk. It's an ultra-processed food, but Dr. Ali says it can be a good cow’s milk substitute for people who are sensitive to dairy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Yang just recommends doing your best to learn more about ultra-processed foods, and limit how much of them you have. “A reasonable goal would be to shift toward a diet where whole or minimally-processed foods are the foundation, with ultra-processed foods as the occasional indulgence rather than a dietary staple,” he says. “Much like screen time or dessert, moderation is key.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 16:01:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE9kTGJHdVdXX0tpOTZaYTQ0WWVORmJGVFFaSUlRblJQektTcktKdW1YNU5vZzNpRHhVbGlrdnJMTVpKXzRJMkxQcjlBUGtDMi1MWW9hTGhSVDVsY3M4Sk5Oc1B2WHMydEtqWkpIS2haRUJ6Zw</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Have Discovered Shocking Amounts of Microplastics in the Brain – And It Could Be Increasing Our Risk of Dementia - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi4AFBVV95cUxQMzBvTkV2XzFoYkNaUUVRUW5yNkVIUUhPUXFES0hJemN6YmxPcThvYnZaY2tnbXhGR0tmcWZfTjFLdDVpVWtFenBoN2Zfd09IV2g5V1htdEFsOElaZkpfNjlTT0tUekRVQ2pqMm42d0dDdUFWamhjdzdDTjRqWHhIODdJbmtKbkhoOGloenlnTGZkUTZ0NUhzYzJFU3hma3VVTlA3TldmSkkwXzZVbU02c2JRZWxFck9PWlNoY04yeVVXMzcwVFltckk3ZjhDSm5YeHAySHpjRHBVREU0aFo4SA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 15:17:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4AFBVV95cUxQMzBvTkV2XzFoYkNaUUVRUW5yNkVIUUhPUXFES0hJemN6YmxPcThvYnZaY2tnbXhGR0tmcWZfTjFLdDVpVWtFenBoN2Zfd09IV2g5V1htdEFsOElaZkpfNjlTT0tUekRVQ2pqMm42d0dDdUFWamhjdzdDTjRqWHhIODdJbmtKbkhoOGloenlnTGZkUTZ0NUhzYzJFU3hma3VVTlA3TldmSkkwXzZVbU02c2JRZWxFck9PWlNoY04yeVVXMzcwVFltckk3ZjhDSm5YeHAySHpjRHBVREU0aFo4SA</guid></item><item><title>Bacterial infection common in women may actually be an STI: Study - NewsNation Now</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE9tRDRsWEtlRzZuZUg4MU5pRGNFQmU2LVd5eEpyMS1IRmcwU0ZpWHRuSDdZODM3N1Ryb194S2tsSUUweG9QM19qU0hVY2h4dkctVm1Gb0ltZVZNZ3BySHpGWmExRVpMdEJqNnU0amFKdFlzOHRsT1dVUERSMXJZaWvSAYQBQVVfeXFMTXZ1Q0I4MXdwMS1tZWZJMExuSXpGcG12Vk9LNFM3bTVOZEV6M3VEcENmd1VkVHNteC1ZQzRBbEZWZTRORV9IUjNGZHAtdUhaa3BYdnFGV2FEclpDeWJTYlVTMmMxMzhNRXhOVE5Ga1N0WWstdWlJM1lxSHRvc2xSSG9CelFC?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

More recently, however, research has revealed that microplastics infiltrate human bodies, particularly the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As studies reveal new details about the accumulation of plastic particles in our bodies, scientists are delving deeper into their potential impacts and ways to prevent exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39901044/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that our brains house around a spoonful of these tiny plastic fragments, which is alarming, to say the least. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers analyzed the brains of deceased people who had been diagnosed with dementia, their levels of microplastics were 3-5 times higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to these and other relevant findings, researchers from the &lt;a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; and the University of Toronto published a review of the current state of knowledge on the accumulation of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/micro-nanoplastics-mnps-help-cancer-cells-spread/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;micro and nanoplastics&lt;/a&gt; (MNPs) in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-microplastics-in-the-brain"&gt;Microplastics in the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis showed that microplastics are pervasive in the water we drink, the food we eat, and the air we breathe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The dramatic increase in brain microplastic concentrations over just eight years, from 2016 to 2024, is particularly alarming. This rise mirrors the exponential increase we’re seeing in environmental microplastic levels,&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt; said Dr. Nicholas Fabiano from the University of Ottawa’s Department of Psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that concentrations of MNPs were 7-30 times higher in brain tissue than in other vital organs, such as the liver or kidneys. It seems that our &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/our-brains-are-constantly-working-to-predict-what-comes-next/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brains&lt;/a&gt; are favored by these miniscule shards of plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mostly less than 200 nanometers in length and primarily composed of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/disposable-coffee-cups-release-trillions-of-plastic-particles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;polyethylene&lt;/a&gt;, these tiny invaders were found in the cerebrovascular walls and immune cells of the brain. The particles are small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to speculations about their role in neurological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not certain whether patients with dementia had high levels of MNPs due to the neurological condition, or whether the particles promoted the development of dementia. Future studies will investigate this relationship further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tackling-the-microplastic-menace"&gt;Tackling the microplastic menace&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving beyond the danger they pose, the research highlights useful practices that we can employ in our daily lives to reduce MNP exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An action as simple as opting for filtered tap water instead of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/hundreds-of-thousands-of-nanoplastics-found-in-bottled-water/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bottled water&lt;/a&gt; could lower microplastic intake from a staggering 90,000 to 4,000 particles per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bottled water alone can expose people to nearly as many microplastic particles annually as all ingested and inhaled sources combined. Switching to tap water could reduce this exposure by almost 90%, making it one of the simplest ways to cut down on microplastic intake,” said Dr. Brandon Luu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other significant sources of MNPs include plastic seals in tea bags, which could release millions of tiny particles per brewing session, noted Dr. Luu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Heating food in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plastic-containers-may-release-forever-chemicals-into-food/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;plastic containers&lt;/a&gt; – especially in the microwave – can release substantial amounts of microplastics. Avoiding plastic food storage and using glass or stainless steel alternatives is a small but meaningful step in limiting exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-possible-elimination-pathways"&gt;Possible elimination pathways&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team also reported on studies about potential elimination pathways. For instance, sweating may aid in the removal of certain plastic-derived compounds from the body. However, the researchers caution that more studies are needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need more research to wrap our heads around microplastics – rather than wrapping our brains in them – since this could be one of the biggest environmental storms most people never saw coming,&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt; said Dr. David Puder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commentary emphasizes the need for research priorities, including establishing clear exposure limits and evaluating long-term health repercussions of microplastic bioaccumulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also an urgent need for extensive human studies to uncover relationships between microplastic exposure and chronic health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-microplastics-and-neurological-health"&gt;Microplastics and neurological health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As researchers continue to uncover the extent of microplastic accumulation in the human brain, concerns are mounting about its potential impact on neurological health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of these particles in cerebrovascular walls and immune cells in the brain suggests they may contribute to inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation in the brain has been associated with conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and other cognitive impairments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher concentrations of microplastics in individuals with dementia raise concerns about their role in accelerating neuroinflammation and neurological decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding how these particles interact with brain cells, disrupt neural pathways, and influence cognitive decline is essential for assessing long-term health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full review article was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://genomicpress.kglmeridian.com/view/journals/brainmed/aop/article-10.61373-bm025c.0020/article-10.61373-bm025c.0020.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brain Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 14:30:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxORjE1Qy0wTjladmJxQjZ5NmJlQUtyYkUxQWpwSkI1SVRzYlJscHZOWWxIdEpQZ0I1RjZMaDIxNkVLb1dIR3BoZ0ZiRkIzbkQzRU05cDV5bWcta191VDF1Sk9aVG0xY1poelYtLWlrbFpfRkVYT19mTmhYRXhtNjJfZHZ3MmJSVlhIanFaYw</guid></item><item><title>Getting more of some vitamins during pregnancy may lower future risk of high blood pressure - KSL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixwFBVV95cUxNR3UxTmZQNUctb2Rib1Z3U0tUZlZSNXE4TVZwSlVMRGlYVUFaRm5sMEtwM2tneE1oRTJJZXNKTzdOUjktZVo0d19CQ3lBbE1UeUlnNFgweC1sN250X0NVSUx4WlgtVDRHUzFIcEJRTUQ4M3dGNGdXYUszcHVTVUJwaWNPMFotOVlCTHNwdDdHQnRLeGtaQ29iTUVrUTRJYVduakVPUzBXVjY2SkhZOEVYSEF5RjJQcFpLbkJrN3RLWGVIclFZS1Fj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW ORLEANS — Pregnant women whose blood contains higher levels of essential vitamins and minerals – such as B12, copper and manganese – may face a lower risk for high blood pressure two decades later, new research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, published Thursday in the journal Hypertension, also will be presented Saturday at the American Heart Association's Epidemiology and Prevention/Lifestyle and Cardiometabolic Health Scientific Sessions in New Orleans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manganese, selenium, magnesium and copper are essential metals whose anti-oxidation and anti-inflammatory properties have been shown to help protect against cardiovascular disease. Prior research has linked higher levels of manganese to a lower risk for preeclampsia, or high blood pressure during pregnancy. In the new study, researchers wanted to learn if higher levels of these metals circulating in a woman's blood during pregnancy might influence the risk of developing high blood pressure later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are constantly exposed to heavy metals and trace elements, and much research has shown that exposure to those metals and elements may have an impact on cardiovascular health, especially hypertension," lead study author Dr. Mingyu Zhang said in a news release. Zhang is an epidemiologist and instructor in medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, both in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zhang and his colleagues analyzed data for 493 women enrolled in Project Viva, an ongoing study of women and children in eastern Massachusetts that launched in 1999. Using blood samples collected between 1999 and 2002 during the early stages of the women's pregnancies, the researchers measured concentrations of nonessential metals, including arsenic, barium, cadmium, cesium, mercury and lead, and essential metals, including copper, magnesium, manganese, selenium and zinc. They also measured folate and vitamin B12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 20 years later, between 2017 and 2021, the researchers measured blood pressure for the participants, who were then an average of 51 years old. Participants were considered to have high blood pressure if their measurements were 130/80 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) or above, or if they reported taking medication to control their blood pressure. According to the AHA and American College of Cardiology, blood pressure is considered normal if the systolic reading (the top number) is below 120 mmHg and the diastolic (the bottom number) is under 80 mmHg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For women whose blood levels of copper doubled during pregnancy, the risk of having high blood pressure in midlife was 25% lower. A doubling of manganese during pregnancy resulted in a 20% lower risk. When looking at the combination of copper, manganese, selenium and zinc, the higher the levels found during pregnancy, the lower the risk for high blood pressure in midlife. There was no link between nonessential metals and blood pressure risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher vitamin B12 levels during pregnancy were also associated with a lower midlife risk for high blood pressure. Women with double the amount of B12 during pregnancy had systolic blood pressure measurements that were an average 3.64 mmHg lower and diastolic measurements an average 2.52 mmHg lower than their peers with lower levels of B12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because researchers did not analyze where the women were getting their vitamins and minerals, such as foods or dietary supplements, they cautioned that their findings should not be interpreted as recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, Zhang said, "optimizing these essential metals, minerals and vitamins, particularly copper, manganese and vitamin B12, during pregnancy may offer protective benefits against hypertension in midlife, an especially critical time period for women's future cardiovascular risk in later life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research, including clinical trials, he said, is needed to determine the optimal dietary intake of these minerals and micronutrients. The researchers hope to ultimately identify women at high risk for developing high blood pressure later in life and intervene during pregnancy, either with enhanced nutrition or supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Heart Association News covers heart and brain health.

Additionally, this research is still in its early stages, and it is not yet clear which cancer patients might benefit from taking the drug. The study, recently published in the journal Nature, examined how the immune system responds to cancer metastasis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="ec41n-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="ec41n-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="ec41n-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;It found that platelets, which are responsible for blood clotting, interfere with T cells’ ability to destroy cancer cells. Researchers discovered that aspirin, which inhibits platelet activity, helps the immune system detect and eliminate cancer cells before they form metastases. This discovery was made by chance. The Cambridge research team was not initially studying aspirin but rather how the immune system responds to cancer spread. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="9qofg-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="9qofg-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="9qofg-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Using genetically engineered mice, they found that animals lacking certain genetic instructions were at a lower risk of developing metastases. Further investigation into the body’s processes revealed that T-cells were affected in a manner similar to the known effects of aspirin. This unexpected finding redirected the researchers’ focus entirely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="1t02g-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="1t02g-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="1t02g-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Although the findings are primarily based on animal experiments, they provide important insights that could eventually lead to human clinical trials and improvements in current treatment options. Professor Gil Bar-Sela, director of the Beit Shulamit Cancer Center at the Emek Medical Center in northern Israel, commented on the clinical implications of the new research on aspirin and cancer treatment. "It is still too early to determine the clinical significance of these findings," he said.

This makes it relatively easy to study its effects on cancer patients, particularly those undergoing immunotherapy — a treatment that activates the immune system against cancer cells. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="citph-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="citph-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="citph-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;"Aspirin may serve as a complementary treatment that enhances the effectiveness of immunotherapy, much like other attempts to combine drugs, viruses, or vaccines that stimulate the immune system," Bar-Sela explained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="csdtt-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="csdtt-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="csdtt-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;He noted that a significant advantage is the ability to investigate aspirin’s potential using existing extensive data sets in Israel and globally. A comparison between cancer patients taking aspirin for unrelated reasons and those who do not could provide initial clues about its effectiveness as a complementary treatment. While this is a promising area of research, additional clinical trials are needed before definitive recommendations can be made. Over a decade ago, intriguing data suggested that people who took daily aspirin had a higher chance of survival following a cancer diagnosis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="7bhll-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="7bhll-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="7bhll-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The key to this lies in the moment when a single cancer cell detaches from the primary tumor and attempts to spread through the body — a process known as metastasis, which is responsible for most cancer-related deaths. At this point, the immune system — particularly T cells, a type of white blood cell — can destroy the cancer cell before it establishes itself in a new location. However, researchers found that platelets, the blood cells responsible for clotting, interfere with T-cell activity, preventing them from destroying cancer cells. Aspirin works by inhibiting platelets, thereby removing the obstacle to T-cell function and enabling them to detect and eliminate cancer cells. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="3sqh2-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="3sqh2-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="3sqh2-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;According to the researchers, using aspirin could be most effective for patients diagnosed early, following treatments such as surgery, to help the immune system eliminate remaining cancer cells. However, they emphasize that cancer patients should not rush to purchase aspirin on their own, as much more research is needed in this area. Currently, certain patients with Lynch syndrome — a genetic mutation that increases cancer risk — already take aspirin as part of their preventive treatment. However, to determine whether more cancer patients could benefit from the drug, further clinical trials are required. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul class="public-DraftStyleDefault-ul" data-offset-key="1cum1-0-0"&gt;&lt;li class="public-DraftStyleDefault-unorderedListItem public-DraftStyleDefault-reset public-DraftStyleDefault-depth0 public-DraftStyleDefault-listLTR" data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="1cum1-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="1cum1-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="1cum1-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Increased risk of bleeding:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="1cum1-0-1"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt; Aspirin acts as an antiplatelet agent, preventing blood clotting, which can raise the risk of internal bleeding, especially in the gastrointestinal tract and brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="public-DraftStyleDefault-unorderedListItem public-DraftStyleDefault-depth0 public-DraftStyleDefault-listLTR" data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="l3nv-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="l3nv-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="l3nv-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Gastrointestinal side effects:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="l3nv-0-1"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt; Prolonged aspirin use can lead to stomach ulcers, gastritis and bleeding in the digestive tract, particularly in patients with a history of stomach issues or those taking medications that damage the stomach lining.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="public-DraftStyleDefault-unorderedListItem public-DraftStyleDefault-depth0 public-DraftStyleDefault-listLTR" data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="boe1p-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="boe1p-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="boe1p-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Variable effects depending on cancer type and patient profile:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="boe1p-0-1"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt; There are differences between cancer types and patients’ genetic profiles, meaning not all patients may benefit from the treatment, and some may face higher risks of severe side effects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="public-DraftStyleDefault-unorderedListItem public-DraftStyleDefault-depth0 public-DraftStyleDefault-listLTR" data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="eukuc-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="eukuc-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="eukuc-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Interactions with other treatments:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="eukuc-0-1"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt; Aspirin can affect the efficacy of other medications, including chemotherapy and anticoagulants, increasing the risk of adverse reactions or reducing the effectiveness of certain treatments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="cmc01-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta wrapped"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleWrappedImageComponenta"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleWrappedImageData.SJg0ovxsskg" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/06/HJ11JSMDs1x/HJ11JSMDs1x_697_0_802_1068_0_medium.jpg" alt="פרופ' גיל בר סלע" title="Prof. Gil Bar-Sela  (Photo: Emek Medical Center) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="caption" contenteditable="false"&gt;Prof. Gil Bar-Sela &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span disabled class="credit" contenteditable="false"&gt;Photo: Emek Medical Center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="5c7ng-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="5c7ng-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5c7ng-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Could aspirin have a greater impact on specific types of cancer?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5c7ng-0-1"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;"Based on available data, aspirin’s effect was more pronounced in breast, stomach and prostate cancers,"  Bar-Sela said.

However, as a supplement to other treatments, particularly immunotherapy, it may offer some benefits — a topic that warrants further exploration. For now, as studies remain in various stages of investigation, the use of aspirin as a complementary treatment is not recommended for all patients. Instead, it should only be considered within clinical trials or under strict medical supervision.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Ynetnews</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 12:53:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE0yNTFDaFFkMGY0ZmQ4TGI5aXZZMWU0am1kRVp3aWtoZ1lGOWFTWmxPQmRkRjgwb3BURXR1YmJCXzFYd0ZOejNZV05pTW1sS2xIcHlPcHVfWVg1VkZwaUxzZWwyU2pzb1I5aVE</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Just Discovered a Huge Health Benefit of Coffee - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE55VGxmdE5XbHRaa1p1N0xaN1hDb1lQSEZEaG1fZzFTR09wLTdMWnB3dXA4ZzFJVGl3cUtONi1OZlRoM2hoZHdNemJpV0hiN2tkV05mUXJocGJCc3M3YlF1d1N1R09XUFhLZGJRS3dZSENlY1FTRmZYd0Jrc3VoQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food &amp;amp; Wine / Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As if coffee drinkers needed another excuse to keep brewing their favorite cup, new research suggests that coffee is beneficial for gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, coffee has long been touted for its many health benefits. In fact, thousands of compounds are packed into every cup, helping to improve mental alertness, reduce inflammation, support heart health, and even ease post-workout pain. A recent study published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01858-9" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nature Microbiology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Microbiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reveals a new benefit of coffee: It supports the growth of beneficial gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did researchers discover?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, researchers analyzed stool samples from 22,867 participants to understand the impact of coffee on gut bacteria. They categorized participants into three groups: the “never” group (those who drink fewer than three cups per month), “moderate” coffee drinkers (those who consumed at least three cups per month up to three cups a day), and “heavy” coffee drinkers (those who drink three or more cups per day).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/is-airplane-tap-water-safe-8658075" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Real Reason You Shouldn’t Order Coffee or Tea on an Airplane;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Real Reason You Shouldn’t Order Coffee or Tea on an Airplane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that coffee drinkers had high levels of one specific bacteria strain, &lt;em&gt;L. asaccharolyticus&lt;/em&gt;. The results suggest that drinking coffee can have a positive effect on your gut by helping the growth of good bacteria — an exciting win for coffee drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How important is it to have a healthy gut in the first place?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It turns out that the microbiome in the gut is probably way more important than we even ever expected,” says &lt;a href="https://www.northshore.org/research-institute/investigators/michael-s-caplan-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Michael Caplan, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Michael Caplan, MD&lt;/a&gt;, clinical professor at the University of Chicago and chief scientific officer at Endeavor Health. He explains that the beneficial bacteria in our gut are essential to our overall health, and having a diverse microbiome is crucial. A healthy gut can help prevent traveler’s diarrhea, antibiotic-induced diarrhea, and may even play a role in managing obesity, heart disease, and chemotherapy outcomes, according to Caplan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our gut also houses the majority of our immune cells, making it vital to protect and maintain its strength. A healthy gut also supports digestion, reduces inflammation, and influences our thoughts. Have you ever felt nervous and noticed your gut starting to feel uneasy? Our gut and brain are closely intertwined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How exactly does coffee boost beneficial bacteria?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Chaplan points out that it’s actually not only the caffeine that boosts the beneficial bacteria, as even drinking decaf coffee has a positive effect on our gut. The key contributors are likely the polyphenols, including chlorogenic acid and quinic acid, found in coffee, which help boost the growth of this beneficial bacteria. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8747136/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Science;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt; suggests that polyphenols act like prebiotics. They feed and encourage the growth of beneficial gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are there limitations to the study findings?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with any new discovery, further research is needed, especially when it comes to the potential of &lt;em&gt;L. saccharolytic&lt;/em&gt;. Dr. Chaplan explains that this bacteria strain has only been identified in the past five years, so we don’t yet fully understand how it contributes to health benefits. Could it help reduce mortality or improve outcomes in heart disease or cancer? More research is needed to understand how this bacteria could contribute to reducing disease and improving health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much coffee does one need to drink to gain these benefits?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s very safe to have one or two cups of coffee a day, and that would be enough to stimulate your intestinal flora to be poised to help you improve your long-term health,” says Dr. Caplan. This aligns with &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:FDA recommendations;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;FDA recommendations&lt;/a&gt;, which keep caffeine intake to no more than 400 milligrams a day or about four cups of brewed coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/morning-coffee-health-benefits-study-8772574" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:A New Study Says Morning Coffee Drinkers May Get More Benefits Than Those Who Sip It All Day;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;A New Study Says Morning Coffee Drinkers May Get More Benefits Than Those Who Sip It All Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And good news for those who love a little splash of milk or sprinkle of sugar in their coffee, the study showed that these additions don’t affect the gut health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new research is exciting news for coffee drinkers, as coffee has yet to be linked to improved gut health. But don’t forget about other foods and drinks that can also support a healthy gut, such as yogurt, kefir, fermented foods like kefir, kimchi and sauerkraut, and kombucha.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/coffee-gut-health-benefits-11693595" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Food &amp;amp; Wine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Food &amp;amp; Wine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 12:39:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE55VGxmdE5XbHRaa1p1N0xaN1hDb1lQSEZEaG1fZzFTR09wLTdMWnB3dXA4ZzFJVGl3cUtONi1OZlRoM2hoZHdNemJpV0hiN2tkV05mUXJocGJCc3M3YlF1d1N1R09XUFhLZGJRS3dZSENlY1FTRmZYd0Jrc3VoQQ</guid></item><item><title>Shocking stories of people who went blind after taking Ozempic and Mounjaro - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billed by many as miracle drugs for its instant results in weight loss, the 'silver bullet' Ozempic and its cousins have now been linked to vision impairment and blindness, in a growing number of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight loss drugs like Ozempic, Mounjaro, and Zepbound have changed millions of lives by helping people shed extra pounds and reach a healthy weight bracket, thus reversing many chronic diseases. While this seems almost magical and holds a great promise for reducing alarming levels of obesity worldwide, some of the scary and irreversible side effects of the drugs have come under the scanner. One of them is sudden and permanent vision loss, which can have a life-altering consequence for people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/ozempic-blindness-new-study-flags-unexpected-side-effect-of-weight-loss-drugs/articleshow/118148954.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; two months back published in JAMA Ophthalmology talks about nine patients who developed serious optic nerve-related conditions after taking semaglutide or tirzepatide, which is the active ingredient in most weight loss drugs available today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent report in the New York Post talks about the devastating vision loss of James Norris, a 56-year-old mechanic from Roxbury, New Jersey. Always struggling with weight loss, Norris decided to try obesity drug Mounjaro in March 2023, inspired by his wife’s remarkable 60-pound transformation on the same medication. His earlier attempts at losing weight through diet and exercise didn't translate in results, and weighing 289 pounds, Norris really thought that the drug was an easy alternative to shed some quick pounds. Within a year, Norris lost 89 pounds and was able to stop taking medication for high blood pressure and cholesterol, which seemed to be an encouraging progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While initially he was on 1.5 milligrams dose - a relatively low dose - things changed rapidly for him when the dose was increased to 2.5 milligrams. To his surprise, he woke up with a clouded vision in his left eye one morning. Two weeks later, his right eye became blurry too. At first, he dismissed it as a possible sinus infection, but after a series of medical tests, a neuro-ophthalmologist diagnosed him with non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) — a condition in which a sudden loss of blood flow to the optic nerve causes irreversible vision damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was devastated,” he said. “It’s extremely rare to get NAION in both eyes.” While Norris discontinued Mounjaro, he now struggles with daily tasks. Not able to do hands-on-work, he is now forced to do administrative work. He believes the risks associated with these medications, particularly at higher doses, are not worth the potential benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What studies say about Ozempic blindness&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in JAMA Ophthalmology on January 30, 2025, by physician-scientists from the University of Utah’s John A. Moran Eye Center reviewed nine patients who developed serious optic nerve-related conditions after taking semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy) or tirzepatide (used in Mounjaro and Zepbound).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven of the patients reported symptoms consistent with NAION, while others experienced optic nerve inflammation (papillitis) or a condition known as paracentral acute middle maculopathy, which can cause blind spots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research follows a July 2024 study from Harvard’s Mass Eye and Ear hospital, which found that diabetics taking these drugs had a fourfold increased risk of developing NAION, while overweight or obese individuals taking them solely for weight loss faced a sevenfold risk increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/can-ozempic-cause-sudden-vision-loss-a-study-uncovers-the-link/articleshow/116339266.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; diabetes patients using Ozempic were found to be over twice as likely to develop a rare eye condition known as NAION compared to those taking other diabetes medications, according to researchers who analyzed years of patient data from Denmark and Norway. If the risk remains consistent over time, a type 2 diabetes patient taking Ozempic for 20 years would face a 0.3% to 0.5% likelihood of developing NAION, according to a non-peer reviewed study published Thursday on medRxiv.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More horror stories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Post report mentions more cases of weight loss drugs causing vision loss in people. Michael Sabellico, 1 60-year-old took Ozempic in March 2024 to manage his Type 2 diabetes and lose weight. Weighing 185 pounds at the time, he initially lost weight successfully. But after eight weeks on a 1.5 mg dose, he woke up one morning unable to see clearly. He was diagnosed with NAION. At that time, there was no proper research around the link between NAION and Ozempic, so doctors actually increased his Ozempic dose to better manage his blood sugar. He finally stopped taking Ozempic in May 2024, but by then, the damage was done. He now has 20/70 vision in his left eye and 20/30 in his right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheryl Bovee, a 56-year-old from Winston-Salem, North Carolina, has already filed a lawsuit against Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of Ozempic, for what she calls “deceptive and misleading” marketing that downplayed the risks of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bovee, who used Ozempic as prescribed for diabetes management, is now legally blind after developing NAION. “I can no longer work. I can no longer drive. I have to be careful just walking around my block. I can’t see at night,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A widow, she had envisioned a retirement spent traveling and enjoying time with her family. Now, she worries about losing her independence entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All of my hopes and dreams have been dashed,” she said. “I no longer have the hope of seeing my grandchildren’s faces clearly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the growing number of cases, the official websites for Ozempic and Mounjaro list “changes in vision” as a potential side effect, but none explicitly mention NAION.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Inside Ozempic: Does the drug really help in weight loss and what are its possible side effects?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 12:20:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Squats or walking?

It is the most common type of dementia, affecting two-thirds of those diagnosed with the condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recent studies have suggested that diet could play a crucial role in preventing Alzheimer's, sparking interest in the scientific community. The idea that our food intake can impact cognitive abilities in an ageing brain has led to further research into dietary patterns and their potential influence on the development of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Healthy eating habits have been linked to cognitive benefits in various studies, but more research is needed to determine if diet can prevent or delay Alzheimer's or age-related cognitive decline. Certain diets are thought to enhance specific nutrients that protect the brain through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; READ MORE - &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/yorkshire-farms-reuben-owen-confirms-31161342" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Our Yorkshire Farm's Reuben Owen 'confirms' new series in exciting announcement&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; READ MORE - &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/donald-trumps-petty-reaction-king-31161453" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Donald Trump's 'petty' reaction to King Charles meeting Volodymyr Zelensky&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One diet that has shown promise in the prevention of Alzheimer's is the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative delay diet, also known as the MIND diet. While it shares some similarities with the holistic approach of the Mediterranean diet, the MIND diet includes additional food items and restricts others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Although this research is still in its early stages, the initial findings offer a ray of hope as scientists continue to investigate, reports &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/alzheimers-risk-reduced-53-people-31134615" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;Surrey Live&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The MIND diet is a fusion of the Mediterranean and DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diets. The research on this diet, officially known as the Mediterranean-DASH Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, was led by Dr. Martha Clare Morris and her team at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Their study, published in 2015 in Alzheimer's and Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association, found that following the MIND diet could significantly reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, even if it's not strictly adhered to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After analysing dietary habits and other factors over an average period of 4.5 years, they discovered that those who stuck closely to the MIND diet had a 53% lower rate of Alzheimer's compared to those who didn't follow the diet as closely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, what does the MIND diet entail?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Much like its Mediterranean cousin, it encourages the consumption of vegetables, especially leafy greens, and prioritises berries over other fruits. Whole grains, beans, and nuts are also recommended, along with weekly servings of fish and olive oil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The diet suggests limiting intake of red meat, sweets, cheese, butter/margarine, and fast/fried food. While the Mediterranean diet is more relaxed about cheese consumption, it also places a broader emphasis on vegetables beyond the MIND diet's focus on leafy varieties and berries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a related study, adhering to the MIND diet was linked with a significant deceleration of cognitive decline over an average span of nearly five years. These encouraging results call for further investigation.As scientists persist in their quest to stave off this incapacitating illness, additional research is underway.In a similar study, following the MIND diet was associated with a substantial slowing of cognitive decline during an average of almost five years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While these findings are promising, more research is necessary. More studies are being conducted by scientists as they continue to make inroads into preventing the debilitating disease.While it is early days for this research, findings so far are cause for cautious optimism as further investigation is undertaken by the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;section data-embed-group="picture" data-embed-items="2" data-ad-dockable="true" data-redesign-embed="true" data-istail="true" data-orientation="landscape"&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31161511" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The idea that having kids can keep you young might have some scientific basis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A study of more than 37,000 adults has found that parenting can help keep the human brain fit as it ages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For each additional child that a mother or father has, scientists found a boost in brain connectivity that runs counter to what is typically seen in middle- or late-life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This was especially true in regions of the central nervous system associated with movement and sensation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the study, led by &lt;span&gt;cognitive neuroscientist Edwina Orchard at Yale University, claim their research is the largest investigation of parental brain function to date, and the first to show differences in males beyond early fatherhood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153611" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153611" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/AgeParenthoodBrain-642x282.png" alt="Age Parenthood Brain" class="size-medium wp-image-153611" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/AgeParenthoodBrain-642x282.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/AgeParenthoodBrain-944x415.png 944w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/AgeParenthoodBrain-768x337.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/AgeParenthoodBrain-1536x675.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/AgeParenthoodBrain-600x264.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/AgeParenthoodBrain.png 1848w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153611" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Scatter plots examining the association between connectivity and parenthood (left) and&lt;br&gt;connectivity and age (right). Results are present at both edge (top row) and network (bottom row) levels. (Ochard et al., &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2411245122"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The findings, which come from the United Kingdom Biobank, suggest that despite the exhaustion, stresses, and challenges of parenting, having kids may enrich a person's life in the long run, providing much-needed cognitive stimulation, physical activity, and social interaction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The caregiving environment, rather than pregnancy alone, appears important since we see these effects in both mothers and fathers," &lt;a href="https://www.rutgers.edu/news/how-parenthood-may-help-keep-your-brain-young"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; psychiatrist Avram Holmes from Rutgers University.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that's true, it's possible that the direct impact of caregiving could bestow similar benefits to grandparents, childcare workers, or any other person with a strong responsibility for children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fathers are often excluded from studies on parenthood because they don't physically carry a pregnancy, give birth, or breastfeed, but that doesn't mean they aren't profoundly affected by their new household role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having children has a life-changing impact on both the body and mind, and yet neuroscientists know little about the&lt;span&gt; long-term brain effects of parenthood in either sex.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only recently have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/profound-brain-changes-of-pregnancy-revealed-in-scientific-first"&gt;studies shown&lt;/a&gt; the profound brain changes that occur during pregnancy. After a baby is born,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="153572" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; scans reveal the brain architecture of mothers changes in areas involved in contemplation and daydreaming, possibly explaining the symptom of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/baby-brain-is-real-scientists-confirm-and-we-may-finally-know-why"&gt;'baby brain'.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153604" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153604" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/GrayMatterMothers-642x241.png" alt="Gray Matter Mothers" class="size-medium wp-image-153604" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/GrayMatterMothers-642x241.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/GrayMatterMothers-1024x384.png 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/GrayMatterMothers-768x288.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/GrayMatterMothers-1536x576.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/GrayMatterMothers-2048x768.png 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/GrayMatterMothers-600x225.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153604" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Widespread cortical gray matter volume change occurred in step with advancing gestational week. Darker colors indicate regions most affected by the pregnancy transition. (Laura Pritschet)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among first-time fathers, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/first-time-dads-may-experience-brain-shrinkage-scientists-find"&gt;initial research&lt;/a&gt; suggests having a child can lead to a loss of one or two percent of cortical volume. Because this shrinkage occurs in a region associated with parental acceptance and warmth, researchers suspect it is the brain's way of refining this network for a new role in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But what about after a baby has grown up?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To explore the later impacts of parenthood, cognitive neuroscientist Edwina Orchard led a study at Yale University, combed through the brain scans of nearly 20,000 females and more than 17,600 males in the UK Biobank over the age of 40.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For both sexes, parenthood was positively correlated with functional connectivity, which refers to neural activation patterns within and between brain networks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, an aging brain shows lower functional connectivity across the somato/motor network and higher connectivity within cortico-subcortical systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opposite patterns were seen among parents between 40 and 69 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The regions that decrease in functional connectivity as individuals age are the regions associated with increased connectivity when individuals have had children," &lt;a href="https://www.rutgers.edu/news/how-parenthood-may-help-keep-your-brain-young"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Holmes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These younger-looking brain structures are intriguing, but Holmes, Orchard, and their colleagues say larger and more diverse long-term brain studies are needed to tease apart all the various contributing factors that could be impacting how we age.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2411245122"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;PNAS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The scientists found that it increased the development of &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322428" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:polyps;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;polyps&lt;/a&gt;. Some polyps have the potential to develop into colorectal cancer. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-025-01938-4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nature Microbiology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Microbiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How might certain bacteria lead to cancer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer, which occurs in the colon and rectum, is one of the most &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:frequently diagnosed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;frequently diagnosed&lt;/a&gt; cancers in the United States. This cancer occurs in one out of 24 men and one out of 26 women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Recent data has shown that colorectal cancer cases in adults ages 30 to 34 saw an &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/colorectal-cancer-rising-children-teens-170247331.html" data-ylk="slk:increase of 71%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;increase of 71%&lt;/a&gt;, and in adults ages 35 to 39, this number saw a 58% increas&lt;/span&gt;e from 1999 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/united-states-cancer-statistics/publications/colorectal-cancer-stat-bite.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&lt;/a&gt;, colorectal cancer has a 5-year survival rate of 64.4%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is no way to guarantee that one can prevent colorectal cancer, there are some ways people can &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/causes-risks-prevention/prevention.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lower their risk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lower their risk&lt;/a&gt;. A few of these include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ceasing smoking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;limiting alcohol intake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;eating a diet that is high in vegetables, fruits, and whole grains&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;limiting processed foods and red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since researchers suspect that dietary choices may be connected to the development of colorectal cancer, the new study aimed to determine whether there was a connection between specific diet types combined with certain types of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They focused on three bacteria: &lt;em&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;fragilis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Helicobacter hepaticus&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; coli&lt;/em&gt;, which they used to colonize the mice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These microorganisms cause DNA damage in intestinal epithelial cells either directly through the production of genotoxins or indirectly through the induction of DNA-damaging inflammatory mediators,” the authors explained in the study paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study focused on mice that were fed low-carb and low-fiber diets, normal chow diets, and Western-style diets, which were high in fat and sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; and low carb diets increase cancer risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After feeding the mice their specific diet types for nine weeks, the scientists checked for polyp development and then measured any polyp development again at 16 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Of the bacteria and diets tested, only the combination of the low carb diet and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; showed the potential to increase the risk of colorectal cancer. This is significant since, according to the study authors, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is present in 60% of colorectal cancer cases.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice in this combination had a higher number of polyps and tumors, which can increase the risk of developing colorectal cancer. Additionally, these mice also showed DNA damage and other markers that lead to a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The low carb diet thinned the mucus layer in the colon that protects against microbes.

It was the excellence of Sullivan’s left frontal cortex that had helped her excel not only in matters of civil law, but also in criminal cases and as presiding judge of the El Dorado County Juvenile Court from 2015 to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was also the part of her brain that gave her language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clelland diagnosed Sullivan in April 2023 with “primary progressive aphasia.” It meant that her  impaired ability to communicate and to understand written and verbal language — aphasia — would only get worse over the next several years. PPA, it turns out, is a form of early dementia. There was no way to stop the fatal disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT1" data-large-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eldorado.courts.ca.gov/system/files/general/el-dorado-county-superior-court-announces-retirement-judge-dylan-sullivan.pdf" data-link="native" class=""&gt;Sullivan retired&lt;/a&gt; within days of the diagnosis.

Adams, who died in 2007, had never been much of a painter before her PPA diagnosis, according to the play by Jake Broder, a visiting artist at UCSF. But as her left brain function declined, other areas of her brain grew stronger — and with those changes emerged an extraordinary artistic talent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her defining work was an array of colorful geometric shapes that precisely matched the musical elements of “&lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://youtube.com/watch?v=E9PiL5icwic&amp;amp;si=TArulY9K3LyyvQXo__;!!Ivohdkk!h85zRantrmlqgfQGfOCurk9J8EdNliZQGYsffk30kO6rnIf0A0LStNDBNyudHzwCGwKL3ng2SVKbNfEuiihF0g%24" data-link="native" class=""&gt;Bolero&lt;/a&gt;,” a spellbinding composition by the French pianist Maurice Ravel. His death in 1937 at age 62, after experiencing language loss and dementia, has been attributed to PPA.

A day later, Sullivan created a pinecone, bathed in shadow and light, nestled within graceful, green pine needles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, her drawings grew more complex: Among some 30 works so far, she has drawn an owl in flight, an abstract rendering of her own creativity and a detailed re-creation of her brain scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most extraordinary, Sullivan produced an intricate line drawing of two seated figures, back to back, their heads bowed. Within the figures stand their childhood selves, fleshed out and embracing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sullivan drew “Connection Dylan and Sean” as a gift for her brother in April 2024. Her written description reflects her evolving use of language: “We connected Dylan and Sean on infants and adults. Sean loves me. Dylan loves Sean. The parents are the father’s abandonment and the mother’s neglect and abuse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sullivan described her Aug. 14, 2023, drawing, “Life Cycle” — of a butterfly in stages of development — this way: “The butterfly is energetic and powerful. I’m happy and curious. My FTD (frontotemporal dementia) death is acceptance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 ya block"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Storm,” a drawing of Dylan’s Sullivan’s dog, was completed in colored pencil on Aug. 29, 2023, and shows the fast evolution of her nascent artistic skill. Afflicted with aphasia, she described the work: “My buddy is the dog hugging, supporting, food cooking, walking, treats, toys, Veterinary, and my love Storm.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Provided by Dylan Sullivan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;‘Stunning’ transformation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly two years after her diagnosis, Sullivan still drives and lives alone near Sacramento with her pitbull, Storm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My buddy is the dog hugging, supporting, food cooking, walking, treats, toys, Veterinary, and my love Storm,” is how Sullivan captioned her Aug. 29, 2023, drawing of her brown and white companion sitting on a sidewalk. Storm’s propeller-shaped ears and hanging tongue direct the viewer’s eye with splashes of vivid pink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve known her for a long time, and she could not draw” before her diagnosis, said Khymberli Apaloo, a Superior Court judge in San Bernardino County and president of the California Judges Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two have been close since meeting at an orientation for new judges in 2012, and Apaloo knew that the best her friend could muster in the drawing department was an occasional stick figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet one of Apaloo’s treasures is “Peonies,” a drawing Sullivan made for her in 2023 showing a pair of flowers so alive you could almost smell them. Awash in pinks and greens, the undulating petals encircle yellow pistils and sit atop green, leafy stalks with every vein and shadow visible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To see that transformation is stunning. Absolutely stunning,” said Apaloo, who described her friend as a “super smart” judge. “She was one of the people I could confer with confidently. She either knew the answer or would walk through it with me logically. She seemed to always know something about what you were talking about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Sullivan uses a tablet to ask questions and express basic information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To hear her voice and to talk when I’m calling, it’s something you don’t know you’re going to miss,” Apaloo said, her voice trailing off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born to very young parents, Sullivan has described her childhood — in San Francisco, up near the Oregon border and eventually in Davis — as neglectful, with a father who abandoned the family early. But with Sullivan unable to tell her story, friends and family were also reluctant to offer details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sullivan graduated from UC Davis in 1988, then spent eight years in sales. But at night she went to school, and in 1997, she graduated from the University of the Pacific, McGeorge School of Law. Sullivan received a law student’s highest honor when she was invited into the Order of the Coif.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has said that her painful experiences in childhood influenced her decision to become a Juvenile Court judge. In a four-page memoir she wrote as her language skills began to fade, Sullivan described her job as the “rehabilitation and encourage of children” and said that in her role she “reduced juvenile incarceration from 40-45% to 10-13%.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retired judge recently greeted a reporter who came to her home to watch her work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How are you?” Sullivan wrote on her communication tablet, flipping it so the reporter could see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sullivan herself appeared well. Tall and slender, she wore wire-framed glasses and had dark brown hair cut in a bob.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still athletic despite two knee replacements, Sullivan had excelled on her college basketball team, and the reporter asked what position she had played. Sullivan wrote: “physiology #3 small forward,” indicating her major, her position’s numerical designation, and the position itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also wrote: “I’m in the UCD Basketball Dani, Diz, Ellie, Cathy, Pat, Laurie.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 ya block"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Peonies,” completed on Sept. 23, 2023, is another early drawing. Sullivan created it for a friend, San Bernardino County Superior Court Judge Khymberli Apaloo, who was astonished because Sullivan “could not draw.” Sullivan’s description: “The pink and red peonies, and green leaves and stems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Provided by Dylan Sullivan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A supportive circle of friends&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These were the lifelong friends she made on the team. Today they constitute a different team as her devoted support system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, “Diz” is Elizabeth Disbrow, director of the Center for Brain Health at Louisiana State University Health, who never imagined during those days on the court, or when Sullivan stood as her maid of honor, that her career and her friend’s survival would become so entwined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disbrow took action when Sullivan phoned her to say a doctor had said she had Alzheimer’s disease. Disbrow assured her that she did not have Alzheimer’s. Yet having worked at UCSF, Disbrow knew her way around the San Francisco medical center and didn’t let up until she had secured an appointment with Clelland, who would provide the correct, still devastating, diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, Sullivan and Disbrow have crisscrossed the country to see each other — not as neurologist and patient, but as dear friends, going to dinner, hiking and taking spa treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Getting massages and going to the hot springs — it’s just really fun,” Disbrow said. “But I think she’s sad. She’s had to give up so much. But she’s a bulldozer. She’s tough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Apaloo, Disbrow is certain that Sullivan was never artistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not at all. I don’t think I ever saw her doodle,” she said. “That part of her brain was not engaged. My childhood was different. My mom took me to art class. I’m sure she had none of that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Sullivan’s communication skills deteriorate, “her art becomes much richer in detail,” said Clelland, her neurologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain’s ability to adapt and change is called “neuroplasticity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, 2024, 13 months after her diagnosis, Sullivan drew two pieces that invited viewers directly into her brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first, “Creativity,” features a brain complete with folds and wrinkles set vertically in the center of the canvas. Its gray left side connects to a black-and-white grid of symbols that suggest logic and analysis: a clock, a rocket ship to Saturn, a beehive pattern, a bus with road signs and more. The right side of the brain glows in a rainbow of colors connected to an abstract whirlpool of vibrant hues that morph into butterflies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m logical and intelligent in the UCD physiology, McGeorge Law, Attorney, and Superior Court Judge,” she wrote about the work. “I’m not communicating. The hemisphere of the right brain is creative and curious. I’m happy!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Days later, studying her MRI, she drew a cross section of her own brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clelland was astonished at its accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I see an incredibly, accurately detailed drawing of her MRI,” she said. “And I see the pain she’s experiencing. The left side of her brain is starting to thin out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For me, it’s a very emotional piece.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sulllivan described the drawing, in part: “My frontal lobe is the MRI, and I do not talk, write or read. My right hemisphere of the brain is neuroplasticity, which is curious, creative and present.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 p1h5oaun mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 ya block"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),” which Sullivan completed on May 22, 2024, depicts the imaging of her own brain. Her description: “I’m MRI drawing in grey, black, and white. My small frontal lobe is left side-up front in the frontal lobe, and the left bottom is black. My frontal lobe is the MRI, and I do not talk, write, or read. My right hemisphere of the brain is neuroplasticity, which is curious, creative, and present.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Provided by Dylan Sullivan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The artistic process&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day the reporter visited, Sullivan showed drawing after drawing hanging from the walls of her two-story condo. These were among more than 30 works in colored pencil that Sullivan has created in the last year and a half, some of which she has given as gifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she settled at the kitchen bar to draw, she did not merely put pencil to paper. Instead, to recreate the photo of a bald eagle gripping a branch that she had called up on a tablet to her left, Sullivan used a ruler to precisely measure every element of her subject, from the width of its folded wing to the distance between its feathers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These she meticulously recorded on a pad to her right, and with a calculator made unspecified computations. The result was four long, neat columns of numbers, cross-outs and circled figures that filled the page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sullivan had begun the eagle drawing sometime before. But her canvas did not feature the typical broad outlines of an unfinished work, in which an artist adds increasing levels of detail until satisfied the piece is done. Instead, Sullivan had drawn her subject with extraordinary precision — the bird’s piercing eye, its hooked yellow beak and majestic feathers and claws — everywhere except its right wing and a patch of breast. These swaths remained virgin canvas, white and untouched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chronicle showed a few of Sullivan’s pieces to Bay Area artist Robin Bordow, who has had pieces exhibited in the de Young Museum in San Francisco and elsewhere, and works in paint and colored pencil. Bordow knew nothing of Sullivan’s diagnosis when she commented on the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I quite liked it and thought it showed a skill level usually gained after years of prior work,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The variation in subject matter and style seemed remarkable as well, considering it’s coming from a relative beginner,” said Bordow, who owns the City Art Cooperative Gallery in San Francisco, which exhibits the work of emerging artists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The work is solid enough to be accepted by our gallery,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 p1h5oaun mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 ya block"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eagle” was completed on Feb. 16 but was still a work in progress on Feb. 3 and shows the ruler Sullivan used to measure her subject, a close-up photo of a bald eagle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nanette Asimov / Chronicle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Planning for the future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that Sullivan could offer her work for exhibition, or authorize her friends to pursue the possibility. She is also planning for a future she never wanted, and has signed herself up to move into a memory-care facility next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although primary progressive aphasia is often a genetic disease, Sullivan’s doctors say that hers was spontaneous. Yet they believe that even when PPA emerges seemingly from nowhere, it could also — someday — be cured by the tools of genetic engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clelland is pursuing such a cure for neurodegenerative diseases, including PPA and other types of fronto-temporal dementia, as well as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re working as fast as we can,” said Clelland, whose lab at UCSF has already figured out how to repair the mutations in a petri dish using CRISPR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to that gene editing tool, sickle-cell disease has become treatable, and fixes for liver diseases are in clinical trials.

Kennedy Jr. speaks in the Oval Office of the White House, on the day he is sworn in as secretary of Health and Human Service in Washington, D.C., U.S., Feb. 13, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Nathan Howard | Reuters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nation's &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/19/rfk-jr-is-trump-pick-for-hhs-secretary-heres-what-he-could-do.html"&gt;new top health official&lt;/a&gt; could further erode &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline-as-trump-heads-for-a-second-term/" target="_blank"&gt;already falling U.S. vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; against once-common childhood diseases, a development that comes as &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/26/a-child-dies-of-measles-in-west-texas-outbreak.html"&gt;a growing measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; has led to the first U.S. death from the disease in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/25/healthy-returns-hhs-secretary-rfk-jrs-efforts-could-affect-vaccines.html"&gt;prominent vaccine skeptic&lt;/a&gt;, now leads the Department of Health and Human Services and wields enormous power over the federal agencies that regulate vaccines and set shot recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy tried to distance himself from his previous views during his &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/watch-rfk-jr-senate-confirmation-hearing-for-hhs-secretary.html"&gt;Senate confirmation hearings&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that he isn't "anti-vaccine" and would not make it "difficult or discourage people from taking" routine shots for measles and polio. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some health policy experts said his early moves as HHS Secretary are concerning and suggest that he could undermine immunizations in other, less direct ways, which could increase the risk of children catching preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The steps that he's taken so far seem to be in line with his views of skepticism about vaccines and their safety, of wanting to allow for parents to not get their children vaccinated. It's all things he's championed," said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF. "There might be more dominoes to fall coming."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has said he will review the childhood vaccination schedule, and is &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/kennedy-prepares-shakeup-of-vaccine-advisers-00205223" target="_blank"&gt;reportedly preparing&lt;/a&gt; to remove and replace members of external committees that advise the government on vaccine approvals and other key public health decisions, among other efforts. Some experts said he could also amplify data highlighting the risks of vaccines, promote unfounded claims about shots and undermine legal protections for vaccine makers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If rates drop even more, there could be major consequences, such as renewed outbreaks of vaccine-preventable illnesses in certain communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Within the next couple of years, we could see major drops in childhood vaccination rates," Lawrence Gostin, professor of public health law at Georgetown University, told CNBC. "He has all the powers he needs to sow public distrust in vaccines. He has a history of doing that and he has a desire to do it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This could lead to significant outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases throughout America, with the disproportionate impact on red states that President Trump carried in the 2024 election," Gostin added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has a long track record of making misleading and false statements about the safety of shots. He has claimed they are linked to autism despite decades of studies that debunk that association. Kennedy is also the founder of the nonprofit Children's Health Defense, the most well-funded anti-vaccine organization in the U.S. In a &lt;a href="https://extapps2.oge.gov/201/Presiden.nsf/PAS+Index/F3C8425ED335BB5685258C1A00565D57/%24FILE/Kennedy%2C%20Jr.%2C%20Robert%20F.%20%20finalEA.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;government ethics agreement&lt;/a&gt; in January, he said he stopped serving as chairman or chief legal counsel for the organization as of December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But vaccines have saved the lives of more than 1.1 million children in the U.S. and saved Americans &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/childhood-vaccines-have-prevented-half-billion-illnesses-saved-us-27-trillion-3#:~:text=The%20investigators%20found%20that%2C%20among,%242.7%20trillion%20in%20societal%20costs." target="_blank"&gt;$540 billion in direct health-care costs&lt;/a&gt; over the last three decades, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7331a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention research released&lt;/a&gt; in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;States and local jurisdictions set vaccine requirements for school children, but the federal government has a longstanding system for approving and recommending shots for the public. That includes creating the childhood vaccination schedule, which recommends when children should receive certain shots. It's used by states, pediatricians and parents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Why have childhood vaccination rates fallen?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childhood vaccinations and the state requirements in place for them have been "one of the greatest public health success stories" in the U.S., allowing the country to eliminate many diseases that people once feared, such as polio, according to William Moss, professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rates stayed relatively steady for nearly a decade before the Covid pandemic, as about 95% of kindergarten children were up to date with all state required vaccines, Moss said. That includes separate shots for polio and varicella, a vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella – called MMR – as well as a jab that protects against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the share of kindergarten children who are up to date on their vaccinations has dipped since the pandemic, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;data collected and aggregated annually&lt;/a&gt; by the CDC from state and local immunization programs. Less than 93% of kindergarteners had received all state required vaccines in the 2023-2024 school year, data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Exemptions&lt;/a&gt; from school vaccination requirements, particularly non-medical exemptions, have also increased, according to the CDC. The share of U.S. children claiming an exemption from one or more shots rose from 2.5% in the 2019-2020 school year to 3.3% in the 2023-2024 school year, the highest national exemption rate to date. Nearly all of that increase was driven by non-medical exemptions, such as religious or personal belief reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That decrease appears consistent with the public's perception of childhood immunizations. A Gallup &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648308/far-fewer-regard-childhood-vaccinations-important.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;survey released&lt;/a&gt; in August found only 40% of Americans said they considered childhood vaccines extremely important, down from 58% in 2019 and 64% in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall decline is fueled in part by vaccine skepticism, a trend that "certainly existed far before the pandemic," KFF's Michaud said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine hesitancy and the anti-vaccine movement have been around globally for decades. They are often intertwined with political, moral and spiritual ideas around the rights of an individual versus the community, the limits of government power over bodily autonomy, mistrust of medical institutions and misinformation about shot safety and efficacy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The politicization of the pandemic only fueled more doubts about vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It created a partisan divide on the public's acceptance of the Covid vaccine, according to Sean O'Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on infectious diseases. Social media and public figures amplified misinformation about Covid jabs, and some of those "falsehoods about Covid shots spilled over to an extent to other types of vaccinations," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was a very precipitous drop [in vaccination rates] right when the pandemic hit, in those first few months afterwards," O'Leary said. "And we never really completely caught up." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Leary noted that the vast majority of parents on both sides of the political spectrum continue to vaccinate their kids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, surveys suggest that the partisan division on immunizations has deepened in recent years. In 2024, 63% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters said childhood vaccinations were "extremely important," compared to just 26% of Republicans and GOP leaners, according to the August Gallup &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648308/far-fewer-regard-childhood-vaccinations-important.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years earlier, enthusiasm was just slightly higher among the Democratic group at 67%, and double among Republican respondents at 52%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are "certainly political ideologies that are driving vaccine policy in certain areas of the country," which has a "clear downstream impact on vaccination levels," said Dr. Neil Maniar, a public health professor at Northeastern University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over three-quarters of U.S. states, or 39, had vaccination rates for the MMR shot below the "Healthy People 2030" target rate of 95% during the 2023-2024 school year. That refers to the level needed to prevent community transmission of measles, a highly contagious and deadly virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data means that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;roughly 280,000 school children&lt;/a&gt; were unvaccinated and unprotected against measles during that school year, according to the CDC. MMR vaccination rates among kindergarteners vary across states, ranging from a low of around 80% in Idaho to a high of more than 98% in West Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moss noted that clusters of unvaccinated people within a specific community increase the risk of disease outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's where you're going to get these larger outbreaks like we're seeing in Texas right now with measles," Moss said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A child who wasn't vaccinated died in the outbreak in rural West Texas, state officials said in late February, the first U.S. death from the disease since 2015. The childhood vaccination rate for measles in Gaines County, the epicenter of the current outbreak in Texas, is just below 82%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second patient, an unvaccinated adult in New Mexico, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-new-mexico-resident-tests-positive-death-rcna195231" target="_blank"&gt;tested positive for measles after death&lt;/a&gt;, state officials said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy last week said shots protect communities from measles, but emphasized that the decision to vaccinate "is a personal one." He also &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/health/kennedy-measles-texas-doctor-treatment/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;pushed unconventional treatment regimens&lt;/a&gt; for measles, including cod liver oil, which is rich in vitamin A. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Kennedy could target vaccine advisory panels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy's HHS already appears to be targeting a key part of U.S. vaccine policy: external advisors to the government health agencies that approve shots and set recommendations for them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government postponed a meeting of vaccine advisors to the CDC and&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-cancels-meeting-select-flu-strains-seasons-shots-rcna193931" target="_blank"&gt; a separate meeting of advisors&lt;/a&gt; to the Food and Drug Administration, the latter of which is crucial to determining the flu strains in next season's shots. It is unclear why the meetings were canceled or when they will be rescheduled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108087127" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"&gt;FILE PHOTO: The headquarters of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seen in Silver Spring, Maryland November 4, 2009. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Jason Reed | Reuters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One "clear step" Kennedy can also take to undermine vaccinations is removing members of those advisory panels that shape the government's shot recommendations, including which jabs are covered at no cost by different types of insurance, according to Georgetown's Gostin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several reports have said Kennedy plans to replace members whom he perceives to have "conflicts of interest," though it is unclear how many people will be outed or when. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gostin called conflicts of interest one of Kennedy's "code words" for "simply purging hard working, experienced scientists from advisory committees and replacing them with those that are more skeptical of shots." All HHS agencies and their advisory panels have rigorous policies for conflicts of interest, and there have been no related issues for years, he noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy's shake-up of advisory committees could produce "bogus recommendations" that highlight the harms rather than the benefits of shots, according to Gostin. He said those recommendations could influence governors, legislatures and school boards in red states, which could adopt policies that reduce childhood immunizations and "create wide-open opt outs of shots." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those recommendations could also create greater distrust in the CDC and Trump administration among scientists and public health experts, including Gostin himself, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108108637" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"&gt;Sherry Andrews prepares a MMR vaccine at the City of Lubbock Heath Department in Lubbock, Texas, U.S. Feb. 27, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Annie Rice | Reuters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will have a longer-term corrosive effect on the value of science in America, which is already under severe attack," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy is also reviewing the childhood immunization schedule. Experts said that could lead to removing recommendations for certain vaccines or changing their suggested use from "routine" – when the default approach is to vaccinate – to more of an individual choice guided by discussions with a health-care provider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hope is that officials on the state and local level influence policy or implement practices to drive higher vaccination rates, said Northeastern's Maniar. State and local governments may need to "expand the work they do" in some cases to "make up lost ground" and advocate for vaccinations, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Cherry-picking data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy could also cherry-pick data, studies and any other information about vaccines that "create the misleading impression that shots aren't safe and cause severe side effects," according to Gostin. He said Kennedy could include them in official government announcements to undermine the public's faith in shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the campaign trail, Kennedy said he wanted to "restore the transparency" around vaccine safety data and records that he accused HHS officials of hiding. Gostin called transparency another "code word" for "highlighting dubious scientific studies." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that Kennedy's wording suggests that the government's existing vaccine information is not transparent, when databases recording adverse events and immunization rates have long been fully open to the public. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-106686395" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Antonio Perez | Chicago Tribune | Tribune News Service | Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy is reportedly shelving promotions for a variety of shots, including a campaign touting seasonal flu jabs. He wanted the CDC's advertisements to promote the idea of "informed consent" in vaccine decision-making instead, STAT News &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-promotions-rfk-jr-informed-consent/#:~:text=Kennedy%20Jr.,any%20drug%20they%20are%20prescribed." target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in February.

Kennedy Jr., a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/25/healthy-returns-hhs-secretary-rfk-jrs-efforts-could-affect-vaccines.html"&gt;prominent vaccine skeptic&lt;/a&gt;, now leads the Department of Health and Human Services and wields enormous power over the federal agencies that regulate vaccines and set shot recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy tried to distance himself from his previous views during his &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/watch-rfk-jr-senate-confirmation-hearing-for-hhs-secretary.html"&gt;Senate confirmation hearings&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that he isn't "anti-vaccine" and would not make it "difficult or discourage people from taking" routine shots for measles and polio. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some health policy experts said his early moves as HHS Secretary are concerning and suggest that he could undermine immunizations in other, less direct ways, which could increase the risk of children catching preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The steps that he's taken so far seem to be in line with his views of skepticism about vaccines and their safety, of wanting to allow for parents to not get their children vaccinated. It's all things he's championed," said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF. "There might be more dominoes to fall coming."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has said he will review the childhood vaccination schedule, and is &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/kennedy-prepares-shakeup-of-vaccine-advisers-00205223" target="_blank"&gt;reportedly preparing&lt;/a&gt; to remove and replace members of external committees that advise the government on vaccine approvals and other key public health decisions, among other efforts. Some experts said he could also amplify data highlighting the risks of vaccines, promote unfounded claims about shots and undermine legal protections for vaccine makers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If rates drop even more, there could be major consequences, such as renewed outbreaks of vaccine-preventable illnesses in certain communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Within the next couple of years, we could see major drops in childhood vaccination rates," Lawrence Gostin, professor of public health law at Georgetown University, told CNBC. "He has all the powers he needs to sow public distrust in vaccines. He has a history of doing that and he has a desire to do it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This could lead to significant outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases throughout America, with the disproportionate impact on red states that President Trump carried in the 2024 election," Gostin added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has a long track record of making misleading and false statements about the safety of shots. He has claimed they are linked to autism despite decades of studies that debunk that association. Kennedy is also the founder of the nonprofit Children's Health Defense, the most well-funded anti-vaccine organization in the U.S. In a &lt;a href="https://extapps2.oge.gov/201/Presiden.nsf/PAS+Index/F3C8425ED335BB5685258C1A00565D57/%24FILE/Kennedy%2C%20Jr.%2C%20Robert%20F.%20%20finalEA.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;government ethics agreement&lt;/a&gt; in January, he said he stopped serving as chairman or chief legal counsel for the organization as of December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But vaccines have saved the lives of more than 1.1 million children in the U.S. and saved Americans &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/childhood-vaccines-have-prevented-half-billion-illnesses-saved-us-27-trillion-3#:~:text=The%20investigators%20found%20that%2C%20among,%242.7%20trillion%20in%20societal%20costs." target="_blank"&gt;$540 billion in direct health-care costs&lt;/a&gt; over the last three decades, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7331a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention research released&lt;/a&gt; in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;States and local jurisdictions set vaccine requirements for school children, but the federal government has a longstanding system for approving and recommending shots for the public. That includes creating the childhood vaccination schedule, which recommends when children should receive certain shots. It's used by states, pediatricians and parents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Why have childhood vaccination rates fallen?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childhood vaccinations and the state requirements in place for them have been "one of the greatest public health success stories" in the U.S., allowing the country to eliminate many diseases that people once feared, such as polio, according to William Moss, professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rates stayed relatively steady for nearly a decade before the Covid pandemic, as about 95% of kindergarten children were up to date with all state required vaccines, Moss said. That includes separate shots for polio and varicella, a vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella – called MMR – as well as a jab that protects against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the share of kindergarten children who are up to date on their vaccinations has dipped since the pandemic, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;data collected and aggregated annually&lt;/a&gt; by the CDC from state and local immunization programs. Less than 93% of kindergarteners had received all state required vaccines in the 2023-2024 school year, data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Exemptions&lt;/a&gt; from school vaccination requirements, particularly non-medical exemptions, have also increased, according to the CDC. The share of U.S. children claiming an exemption from one or more shots rose from 2.5% in the 2019-2020 school year to 3.3% in the 2023-2024 school year, the highest national exemption rate to date. Nearly all of that increase was driven by non-medical exemptions, such as religious or personal belief reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That decrease appears consistent with the public's perception of childhood immunizations. A Gallup &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648308/far-fewer-regard-childhood-vaccinations-important.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;survey released&lt;/a&gt; in August found only 40% of Americans said they considered childhood vaccines extremely important, down from 58% in 2019 and 64% in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall decline is fueled in part by vaccine skepticism, a trend that "certainly existed far before the pandemic," KFF's Michaud said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine hesitancy and the anti-vaccine movement have been around globally for decades. They are often intertwined with political, moral and spiritual ideas around the rights of an individual versus the community, the limits of government power over bodily autonomy, mistrust of medical institutions and misinformation about shot safety and efficacy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The politicization of the pandemic only fueled more doubts about vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It created a partisan divide on the public's acceptance of the Covid vaccine, according to Sean O'Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on infectious diseases. Social media and public figures amplified misinformation about Covid jabs, and some of those "falsehoods about Covid shots spilled over to an extent to other types of vaccinations," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was a very precipitous drop [in vaccination rates] right when the pandemic hit, in those first few months afterwards," O'Leary said. "And we never really completely caught up." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Leary noted that the vast majority of parents on both sides of the political spectrum continue to vaccinate their kids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, surveys suggest that the partisan division on immunizations has deepened in recent years. In 2024, 63% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters said childhood vaccinations were "extremely important," compared to just 26% of Republicans and GOP leaners, according to the August Gallup &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648308/far-fewer-regard-childhood-vaccinations-important.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years earlier, enthusiasm was just slightly higher among the Democratic group at 67%, and double among Republican respondents at 52%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are "certainly political ideologies that are driving vaccine policy in certain areas of the country," which has a "clear downstream impact on vaccination levels," said Dr. Neil Maniar, a public health professor at Northeastern University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over three-quarters of U.S. states, or 39, had vaccination rates for the MMR shot below the "Healthy People 2030" target rate of 95% during the 2023-2024 school year. That refers to the level needed to prevent community transmission of measles, a highly contagious and deadly virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data means that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;roughly 280,000 school children&lt;/a&gt; were unvaccinated and unprotected against measles during that school year, according to the CDC. MMR vaccination rates among kindergarteners vary across states, ranging from a low of around 80% in Idaho to a high of more than 98% in West Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moss noted that clusters of unvaccinated people within a specific community increase the risk of disease outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's where you're going to get these larger outbreaks like we're seeing in Texas right now with measles," Moss said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A child who wasn't vaccinated died in the outbreak in rural West Texas, state officials said in late February, the first U.S. death from the disease since 2015. The childhood vaccination rate for measles in Gaines County, the epicenter of the current outbreak in Texas, is just below 82%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second patient, an unvaccinated adult in New Mexico, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-new-mexico-resident-tests-positive-death-rcna195231" target="_blank"&gt;tested positive for measles after death&lt;/a&gt;, state officials said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy last week said shots protect communities from measles, but emphasized that the decision to vaccinate "is a personal one." He also &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/health/kennedy-measles-texas-doctor-treatment/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;pushed unconventional treatment regimens&lt;/a&gt; for measles, including cod liver oil, which is rich in vitamin A. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Kennedy could target vaccine advisory panels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy's HHS already appears to be targeting a key part of U.S. vaccine policy: external advisors to the government health agencies that approve shots and set recommendations for them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government postponed a meeting of vaccine advisors to the CDC and&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-cancels-meeting-select-flu-strains-seasons-shots-rcna193931" target="_blank"&gt; a separate meeting of advisors&lt;/a&gt; to the Food and Drug Administration, the latter of which is crucial to determining the flu strains in next season's shots. It is unclear why the meetings were canceled or when they will be rescheduled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108087127" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"&gt;FILE PHOTO: The headquarters of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seen in Silver Spring, Maryland November 4, 2009. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Jason Reed | Reuters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One "clear step" Kennedy can also take to undermine vaccinations is removing members of those advisory panels that shape the government's shot recommendations, including which jabs are covered at no cost by different types of insurance, according to Georgetown's Gostin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several reports have said Kennedy plans to replace members whom he perceives to have "conflicts of interest," though it is unclear how many people will be outed or when. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gostin called conflicts of interest one of Kennedy's "code words" for "simply purging hard working, experienced scientists from advisory committees and replacing them with those that are more skeptical of shots." All HHS agencies and their advisory panels have rigorous policies for conflicts of interest, and there have been no related issues for years, he noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy's shake-up of advisory committees could produce "bogus recommendations" that highlight the harms rather than the benefits of shots, according to Gostin. He said those recommendations could influence governors, legislatures and school boards in red states, which could adopt policies that reduce childhood immunizations and "create wide-open opt outs of shots." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those recommendations could also create greater distrust in the CDC and Trump administration among scientists and public health experts, including Gostin himself, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108108637" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"&gt;Sherry Andrews prepares a MMR vaccine at the City of Lubbock Heath Department in Lubbock, Texas, U.S. Feb. 27, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Annie Rice | Reuters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will have a longer-term corrosive effect on the value of science in America, which is already under severe attack," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy is also reviewing the childhood immunization schedule. Experts said that could lead to removing recommendations for certain vaccines or changing their suggested use from "routine" – when the default approach is to vaccinate – to more of an individual choice guided by discussions with a health-care provider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hope is that officials on the state and local level influence policy or implement practices to drive higher vaccination rates, said Northeastern's Maniar. State and local governments may need to "expand the work they do" in some cases to "make up lost ground" and advocate for vaccinations, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Cherry-picking data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy could also cherry-pick data, studies and any other information about vaccines that "create the misleading impression that shots aren't safe and cause severe side effects," according to Gostin. He said Kennedy could include them in official government announcements to undermine the public's faith in shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the campaign trail, Kennedy said he wanted to "restore the transparency" around vaccine safety data and records that he accused HHS officials of hiding. Gostin called transparency another "code word" for "highlighting dubious scientific studies." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that Kennedy's wording suggests that the government's existing vaccine information is not transparent, when databases recording adverse events and immunization rates have long been fully open to the public. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-106686395" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Antonio Perez | Chicago Tribune | Tribune News Service | Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy is reportedly shelving promotions for a variety of shots, including a campaign touting seasonal flu jabs. He wanted the CDC's advertisements to promote the idea of "informed consent" in vaccine decision-making instead, STAT News &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-promotions-rfk-jr-informed-consent/#:~:text=Kennedy%20Jr.,any%20drug%20they%20are%20prescribed." target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in February. That refers to giving patients important information, including possible risks or benefits of a medical treatment, such as adverse events associated with shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have said while informed consent is important, shifting the framing of advertisements for shots that the CDC has long recommended to focus more on the potential risks could undermine people's willingness to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When a parent exercises informed consent not to have their child immunized with measles, it certainly puts that child at risk, but it puts every child in that school with them at risk," Gostin said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy would need approval from Congress to change the existing legal liability protections in place for vaccine makers, but he could still undermine them in other ways, experts said.

Any changes to the list could change some liability protections for vaccine makers, potentially spurring a wave of litigation over alleged injuries from the shots, he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNBC</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 11:02:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNMllpZVJlZG5IbTFYMWtlTVlxbDRsRDczODRXYjhZa3FIQm5hU0FNdDFwOGpVT0EtVi02WUxBa3VoQnZPb0VIQ2RUN19WV09pTTJpQ3V2OEpPdTBma0hTdzlOQUFxVEJnV3N5TTZQTkM4eFp1ckk2X1VrVnBaMUhyZVVfUDhPUGVEQ3pDUmlGYWVKVXN2Q291STQ4VVFERjJYWHNoS1pB</guid></item><item><title>Coffee Drinkers Have a Secret Health Advantage — Here’s What Scientists Found - Food &amp; Wine</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTFBPa05FRmRRd0lUWmxtZklPUGdIc1R1S2w1X2FBT085S2E3ZXRyd0N5LVNST2pxcUJDbWsxVzFzYU11azRUVVp2bktRd0RkZHlUdDBYQ2hENUNqV3JENFcyX0pTbG95bnRGdG5WMnBKWUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As if coffee drinkers needed another excuse to keep brewing their favorite cup, new research suggests that coffee is beneficial for gut health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, coffee has long been touted for its many health benefits. In fact, thousands of compounds are packed into every cup, helping to improve mental alertness, reduce inflammation, support heart health, and even ease post-workout pain. A recent study published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01858-9" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Microbiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reveals a new benefit of coffee: It supports the growth of beneficial gut bacteria.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In this study, researchers analyzed stool samples from 22,867 participants to understand the impact of coffee on gut bacteria.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It turns out that the microbiome in the gut is probably way more important than we even ever expected,” says &lt;a href="https://www.northshore.org/research-institute/investigators/michael-s-caplan-md/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Michael Caplan, MD&lt;/a&gt;, clinical professor at the University of Chicago and chief scientific officer at Endeavor Health. He explains that the beneficial bacteria in our gut are essential to our overall health, and having a diverse microbiome is crucial. A healthy gut can help prevent traveler’s diarrhea, antibiotic-induced diarrhea, and may even play a role in managing obesity, heart disease, and chemotherapy outcomes, according to Caplan. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Our gut also houses the majority of our immune cells, making it vital to protect and maintain its strength. A healthy gut also supports digestion, reduces inflammation, and influences our thoughts. Have you ever felt nervous and noticed your gut starting to feel uneasy? Our gut and brain are closely intertwined. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-exactly-does-coffee-boost-beneficial-bacteria"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How exactly does coffee boost beneficial bacteria? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dr. Chaplan points out that it’s actually not only the caffeine that boosts the beneficial bacteria, as even drinking decaf coffee has a positive effect on our gut. The key contributors are likely the polyphenols, including chlorogenic acid and quinic acid, found in coffee, which help boost the growth of this beneficial bacteria. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8747136/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt; suggests that polyphenols act like prebiotics. They feed and encourage the growth of beneficial gut bacteria.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As with any new discovery, further research is needed, especially when it comes to the potential of &lt;em&gt;L. saccharolytic&lt;/em&gt;. Dr. Chaplan explains that this bacteria strain has only been identified in the past five years, so we don’t yet fully understand how it contributes to health benefits. Could it help reduce mortality or improve outcomes in heart disease or cancer? More research is needed to understand how this bacteria could contribute to reducing disease and improving health.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It’s very safe to have one or two cups of coffee a day, and that would be enough to stimulate your intestinal flora to be poised to help you improve your long-term health,” says Dr. Caplan. This aligns with &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;FDA recommendations&lt;/a&gt;, which keep caffeine intake to no more than 400 milligrams a day or about four cups of brewed coffee.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And good news for those who love a little splash of milk or sprinkle of sugar in their coffee, the study showed that these additions don’t affect the gut health benefits. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This new research is exciting news for coffee drinkers, as coffee has yet to be linked to improved gut health. But don’t forget about other foods and drinks that can also support a healthy gut, such as yogurt, kefir, fermented foods like kefir, kimchi and sauerkraut, and kombucha.&lt;br&gt;

Their findings also indicated that a low-carb diet in mice was correlated to a thinner mucus lining in the gut.

drug Ozempic, the injections have become an increasingly popular option for people needing, or wanting, to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-d6b8bae0-fb79-11ef-a070-1f9934b25383"&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At least half a million &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-5e5593b0-f855-11ef-8279-ffcfdae8d660" class=""&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; patients and some 15million in the US are now thought to be using the jabs, which can help patients shed up to 20 per cent of their body weight in just a handful of months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But family medic Dr Donald Grant, from The Independent Pharmacy, said there were a number of errors people could make when starting out on the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He warned that not only could these mistakes derail patients' weight-loss plans, some could even land them in A&amp;amp;E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the most common — and serious — mistakes slimmers make is taking too much too soon, Dr Grant said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both Wegovy and Mounjaro patients typically start on weekly 0.25mg jabs for four weeks, before increasing the dosage in stages from there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Dr Grant said patients may be tempted to up the dosage under the logic of 'more is better', this was false and potentially dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Semaglutide and tirzepatide — the powerful ingredients behind Wegovy, Ozempic and Mounjaro — have long been hailed a monumental breakthrough in the war on obesity and type 2 diabetes  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Contrary to popular belief, taking a higher dosage of the medication does not necessarily mean quicker results,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our bodies need time to adjust to the treatment, so beginning on a high dosage could greatly increase the intensity of symptoms such as headaches, fatigue and nausea.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It could also increase the risk of rarer but more serious side effects like pancreatitis, a serious inflammation of the pancreas, and hypoglycaemia, a medical term for potentially dangerous blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Grant added: 'I advise anyone on the treatment to discuss their dosage with a licensed health professional, rather than increasing the strength on their own accord.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another mistake was taking a weight-loss drug without actually acquiring it legitimately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have long warned they are seeing increasing numbers of slim women needing emergency treatment after obtaining the drug from chemists by lying about their weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was recently revealed that a 16-year-old girl &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14457245/high-street-Boots-selling-weight-loss-jabs-children-teens.html"&gt;was able to buy Wegovy&lt;/a&gt; at Boots as part of an undercover sting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Grant said patients obtaining the drug from unreliable sources were taking additional risks.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A common mistake that’s unfortunately being seen more and more is the amount of Brits obtaining these treatments through illegal measures - such as fraudulent sites or social media,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This can be an incredibly dangerous process as these organisations aren’t regulated with the same level of health safety protocols as proper healthcare establishments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As a result, they could have foreign ingredients that could impact well-being.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Under official guidelines, only patients who have a body mass index (BMI) of over 35, or between 30 to 34.9 and meet the criteria for referral to a specialist weight management service, should be prescribed Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mounjaro has similar restrictions under NHS guidelines, with patients needing a BMI of more than 35 and at least one obesity-related health problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ozempic, on the other hand, is a diabetes medication but has been prescribed for weight loss 'off label'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Grant said another mistake patients frequently make is feeling they can 'eat whatever they like' while on the medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sadly, this is simply not the case and eating too many processed or sugary foods could cause blood sugar spikes, leading to increased appetite, bloating and fatigue,' he added.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People should prioritise a well-balanced diet of proteins, fibre and other key nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Although these treatments impact appetite, it’s still important to draw up a dietary plan that includes all the key foods.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a similar vein, Dr Grant said patients should also ensure they stay hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Not doing so risks increasing the intensity of side effects, which can be difficult to manage - particularly for people still adjusting to the medication,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Water is also a key component for weight loss, not drinking enough can slow down progress and lead to dehydration.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On side effects in general, Dr Grant also said it was critical that patients don't ignore them and inform their medical team of any issues so they can help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By keeping your GP up to date with any symptoms, they can provide tailored advice and guidance to lessen side effects and restore a better quality of life,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Common side effects include diarrhoea, nausea and fatigue, while less common symptoms range from shortness of breath to abdominal pain.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Wegovy and Ozempic work by triggering the body to produce a hormone called GLP-1 that is released naturally from the intestines after meals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If any side effects persist, I strongly recommend seeking medical attention for further advice.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Grant's final tip was to ensure you don't skip doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This can halt progress, stopping people from reaching their weight loss goals, as it can increase appetite and reduce the overall effectiveness of the treatment,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Therefore, before beginning any weight loss medication, be sure to consider the long-term costs and reordering processes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weight loss jabs work by mimicking a natural hormone that makes people feel full, reducing their appetite and helping people lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While hailed as a breakthrough in tackling obesity, the drugs have also been shown to significantly reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, side effects are wide-ranging, from nausea and abdominal pain to severe digestive issues, bone pain and a potential higher risk of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14317293/ozempic-weight-jabs-skinny-deadly-cancer-diagnosis.html"&gt;thyroid cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A Mail on Sunday &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14300503/Hundreds-hospital-fat-jabs-numbers-surge.html"&gt;investigation &lt;/a&gt;earlier this year also revealed almost 400 patients had been hospitalised — some with life-threatening complications — since the rollout of the jabs in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 10:45:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxOWlNGMzRpZHRYZ3FCLUY5d2Jhb2Z1enFGWFpnU19VLTJ1Vm1iSVM5WFVUYV9TYnVtaFdtMVpJM2Q2VzJwRFJ0SDk3WFNFUE90T0d4TE5BVHJwakdBQUxpQk5rX0VIODNJd1dnY3BUMTNncjh0cnFCTDVPcE1md2t3RklMSUNHTWM0cm5LYkFxWktaaUc1aGhQVUp1OUpKa2JTdU9ueVFwaEZCNnFlaXfSAbMBQVVfeXFMTXg2aFdIdFFMQ29NSXpHYkFBemxXS3R2TkxVRHExRVVsaTdkN2lLRlNueHR5T2JSRVVUdFVuSVhDRjFHMUFZZmpDdUpudmpFcEh2QnpIODI4RlZyMmc2ZXVaV3EzT3dweTRubkwyZGo1WnlDNXRrRjMyY3hZSnlqWFk0WlRBODdURngydmdHWWlRRHJLQm9udjExODhhT2hpTkxkYnlQOUVoYW4wWXRYcnRMd1U</guid></item><item><title>China Urges Hotels to Install Scales to Tackle Rising Obesity - Bloomberg</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxOUHBqTnBodjFtakc1QTBVQWt3WEJFYzRuRDhTRG5VMnp4c29ZLXdqbmFYMVlHTWdMX3BUSkRMMDV3dXUwQVMxcU5GZVplVWx5d3g0VjBqUURJNEUxTDhJX0VER2xXZlVQYi1OZU0tWWJKT2VqZ1dmaFZPOHJwd3pBZUxONGtDRTRWaTQ5WDFuV2N5T2RnZTQ4cF9wbmZGWGh1UUlKcVVaUV9xaEVpVUROLWlR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content"&gt;&lt;p class="media-ui-Paragraph_text-SqIsdNjh0t0-" data-component="paragraph"&gt;China’s health ministry outlined a range of measures, including urging hotels to install scales, to address the country’s rising obesity rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="media-ui-Paragraph_text-SqIsdNjh0t0-" data-component="paragraph"&gt;The National Health Commission will guide medical institutions to establish clinics to provide professional consultation to help people better manage their weight, commission head Lei Haichao said at a press conference on the sidelines of the National People’s Congress on Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Bloomberg</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 10:43:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxOUHBqTnBodjFtakc1QTBVQWt3WEJFYzRuRDhTRG5VMnp4c29ZLXdqbmFYMVlHTWdMX3BUSkRMMDV3dXUwQVMxcU5GZVplVWx5d3g0VjBqUURJNEUxTDhJX0VER2xXZlVQYi1OZU0tWWJKT2VqZ1dmaFZPOHJwd3pBZUxONGtDRTRWaTQ5WDFuV2N5T2RnZTQ4cF9wbmZGWGh1UUlKcVVaUV9xaEVpVUROLWlR</guid></item></channel></rss>
