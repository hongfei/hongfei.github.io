But the label has been enthusiastically adopted by conservative, right-leaning women across the country. Crunchy content of today is more likely to feature calls to prayer, protecting arms and patriotism than to progressivism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class="gnt_em gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/news/2026/01/20/crunchy-moms-maha-photos/88266029007/" data-t-l="⚑g:l|l|c|view gallery:inline promo" aria-label="View Gallery - 'Crunchy moms' podcast hosts give an inside look at their life" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_gl_i" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/NABJ/86747800007-extremely-normal-episode-crunchy-maha-moms-20.jpg?crop=3599,2025,x0,y187&amp;amp;width=660&amp;amp;height=372&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/NABJ/86747800007-extremely-normal-episode-crunchy-maha-moms-20.jpg?crop=3599,2025,x0,y187&amp;amp;width=1320&amp;amp;height=744&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt=""&gt;&lt;svg class="gnt_em_gl_i_svg"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_camera"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_gl_vg" data-c-tc="18"&gt;&lt;svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_rightArrow"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb" data-c-et="'Crunchy moms' podcast hosts give an inside look at their life" aria-label="Business partners Brandy Bright and April LoConti run the podcast “Crunchy Moms Unfiltered” from their home and a local studio. See a day in their life."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;And one topic, more than any other, has come to define the new crunchy moms movement: vaccine skepticism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As the crunchy moms movement swells, it is emblematic of an increasingly mainstream embrace of vaccine skepticism and a broader lack of trust in established medical science that is alarming scientists and experts in public health.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Dr. Peter Hotez, director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children's Hospital and author of “The Deadly Rise of Anti Science,” decries what he calls a convergence of “snake oil salesmen” from the health and wellness industry with the Trump Administration and Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again movement. This alliance, Hotez says, is wreaking immeasurable damage to Americans’ trust in science and healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The rate of diseases once considered essentially under control, if not eradicated, has been climbing in recent years in the United States as vaccine rates have fallen. Measles, for example, has reached its &lt;a href="https://www.unmc.edu/healthsecurity/transmission/2026/01/07/us-sees-highest-measles-case-count-in-decades-as-outbreaks-grow/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;highest rate of infection in decades&lt;/a&gt;, as outbreaks sicken and kill children across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Anti-vaccine activism is now a leading lethal force in the United States,” Hotez said. “And now it’s spilling over into childhood immunizations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;A movement builds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Within the crunchy moms are women who say they or their children have suffered legitimate harm from vaccines. But also flocking to the movement, and in far greater numbers, are women who question everything from the established benefits of vaccines, to how they are approved and tested, to their reported side effects, without their own personal experiences of harm resulting from vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Business partners Brandy Bright and April LoConti run the podcast “Crunchy Moms Unfiltered” from their home and a local studio just outside Cleveland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/NABJ/86747807007-extremely-normal-episode-crunchy-maha-moms-35.jpg?width=980&amp;amp;height=654&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/NABJ/86747807007-extremely-normal-episode-crunchy-maha-moms-35.jpg?width=1960&amp;amp;height=1308&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Homeschool lessons are given at the LoConti residence, Oct. 14, 2025, in Westlake, Ohio.

Bright says childhood vaccines made her daughter sick, pushing her towards “alternative” research on the vaccine industry. LoConti’s children never suffered such a fate, but nevertheless she’s been pulled in by Bright’s experiences, and stories from moms like her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Over several interviews, Bright and LoConti spoke passionately about the research they have conducted into everything from seed oils to colloidal silver, to double-blind placebo-controlled trials for vaccines. They laid out their reasoning for not trusting vaccines specifically, and the medical and pharmaceutical industries more generally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“For us, it's hard to know who to trust because everything's so intertwined and there's so much money and there's so much behind-the-scenes stuff, and there's nobody asking these questions until now,” LoConti said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That's a sentiment echoed from the very top of the American government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Perhaps the most well-known critic of vaccines, &lt;a target="_blank" href="/news/politics/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" data-autotag="1eef402e-8d6b-4ca9-ae4b-46a1674522c3" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Robert F.

It started with carefully reading the labels on the products they had long enjoyed, from cereals, to cookies, to milk.

Today’s crunchy universe has its own lexicon, myriad complicated theories and counter-theories, and a legion of skeptics and soothsayers, many with scientific or pseudoscientific backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I look back at the food that I used to feed my teenagers and I'm like, ‘Oh my gosh, I would never feed that to my child now,’” Bright said. “And the amount of moms that reach out to us on social media when we talk about this that are like, ‘I had no clue those ingredients that were in this food I was buying for my kids.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As the moms investigated the products they and their children were putting in their bodies, their research quickly took them into the subculture of vaccine skepticism and anti-vaccine research and propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That world was primed to receive crunchy moms like Bright and LoConti. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;‘Just asking questions’ about vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For decades before Bright and LoConti found it, the anti-vaccine movement had been going from strength to strength, picking up millions of followers while developing its pitch and public relations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic supercharged the anti-vaccine rhetoric machine, pulling in millions more Americans angry about masking mandates and social distancing rules.

Concerns about their children’s food and other consumption led to concerns and skepticism about what had been injected into them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If the large corporations had lied to them about food and drink being healthy, they reasoned, the monolithic pharmaceutical companies were probably doing the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;'I've never been anti-vaccine'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In an attempt to understand what future changes may be coming to America's vaccine landscape, USA TODAY sat down for an exclusive interview with Kennedy at the Health and Human Services office in downtown Washington DC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In a wide-ranging conversation, Kennedy clarified his stance on vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I've never been anti-vaccine," Kennedy said. "I've said that thousands and thousands of times. "My concern is that we should set proper safety tests for vaccines so that people understand, and we are able to understand, the risk profile for these products."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Experts like Hotez consider statements like this misleading. Vaccines have already proven their worth because billions of people have taken them and side effects remain vanishingly rare, they argue. Vaccines that have been around for decades were tested originally, and have essentially been tested ever since, they say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That's not good enough for Kennedy and his followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Kennedy&lt;a href="/story/news/politics/2026/01/16/rfk-jr-flu-shot-vaccine/88220106007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt; told USA TODAY that he questions whether he, himself, was injured by annual flu shots&lt;/a&gt;, which he took until the mid 1990s and then later stopped entirely in 2005. The health secretary has spasmodic dysphonia, a neurological voice disorder, that he says may have resulted from his vaccines, although the &lt;a href="https://dystonia-foundation.org/what-is-dystonia/common-misunderstandings/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Dystonia Medical Research Foundation&lt;/a&gt; has said vaccines don't cause the condition and can actually protect against some forms of dystonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Do I know that it was caused by my annual flu shot? I have no idea," he said. "It's a potential culprit that I cannot rule out, but I can't prove it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Kennedy pledged to keep delving into the concerns of mothers like Bright and LoConti, who have lost their faith in the government to tell the truth about complicated medical issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"My job as HHS secretary is to tell the truth to people and then to let them to make up their own minds," he said. "And so we've implemented new policies here where we don't tell 'noble lies.' We tell the truth, whatever the impacts are."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Trusting science, but only &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; science&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There is a fundamental contradiction in the logic employed by crunchy moms like Bright and LoConti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When it comes to established science, and what the experts believe, the scientific community largely has their back when it comes to their views on &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/seed-oils-are-they-actually-toxic" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;seed oils&lt;/a&gt;, or trans fats, or how much screen time their kids should have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But when it comes to vaccines, that support from the established scientific community all but evaporates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Bright and Lo Conti like to say they are simply asking questions – questions they need to ask about everything from the nutritional benefits of Oreos to the value of the measles vaccine – because nobody has ever really questioned these things before, at least not with real, honest American skepticism, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But that’s not really true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Select a few “Crunchy Moms Unfiltered” videos about nutrition – whether raising concerns about heavy metals in foods, or questioning the value of food dyes that are legal in the United States but banned in Europe – and it soon becomes clear that there are actually legitimate scientific concerns underpinning those claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Bright and LoConti question these things precisely &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; they can quickly and easily look up research from large, established scientific institutions that have also asked the same questions many times before. There are dozens of published scientific papers digging into the same concerns the crunchy moms have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When it comes to vaccines, however, the body of research is more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Jonathan Howard, an associate professor of neurology and psychiatry at New York University who has written two books on the anti-vaccine movement, summed up one inherent challenge in researching vaccines:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“One problem with vaccines is the good that they do is invisible, right?” Howard told USA TODAY. “No one ever comes home and says, ‘Boy, my kid didn't get measles today because of the vaccine,’ or ‘My kid didn't get polio today because of the vaccine.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There exist vast troves of data showing how many lives vaccines have saved across the world, Howard said. Study after study has concluded that vaccines have helped eradicate certain diseases while controlling and mitigating others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/NABJ/86747822007-extremely-normal-episode-crunchy-maha-moms-41.jpg?width=980&amp;amp;height=654&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/NABJ/86747822007-extremely-normal-episode-crunchy-maha-moms-41.jpg?width=1960&amp;amp;height=1308&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="April LoConti butters a fresh sourdough tortilla during taco Tuesday night, Oct. 14, 2025, at the LoConti household in Westlake, Ohio."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="April LoConti butters a fresh sourdough tortilla during taco Tuesday night, Oct. 14, 2025, at the LoConti household in Westlake, Ohio." data-c-credit="Andrew Dolph, Akron Beacon Journal"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But for almost every legitimate study that concludes vaccines are beneficial, there are now counterparts that concerned mothers like Bright and LoConti can find online that raise concerns and fear about vaccines, Howard said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The key difference, however, is that the vaccine-skeptical studies Bright and LoConti and other crunchy moms point to do not come from the same established sources that provide much of the fear and skepticism that drive their concerns about food and nutrition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Traditionally, scientists and doctors who have questioned vaccine safety, and even the benefits of vaccines, have quickly become pariahs. Their studies, documentaries and papers are often debunked, ridiculed and dismissed by experts on vaccines and immunology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ultimately, Howard said, to become an anti-vaxxer, or even a vaccine-skeptic, one has to tangibly choose to believe a largely discredited subset of research that is not academically or scientifically sound, over what the vast majority of scientists have long established. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That’s more than just skepticism, Howard said, it’s a form of wilful denial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Nothing is wrong with being skeptical and there's nothing wrong with asking questions; the problem is when you don't accept the answers,” Howard said. “Anyone who now says that they are just asking questions about this sort of thing is not doing that. They are not willing to hear the answer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="/staff/6140582002/will-carless/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Will Carless&lt;/a&gt; covers extremism and emerging issues for USA TODAY.

                                        &lt;p&gt;It’s been a year since a measles outbreak began in West Texas, and international health authorities say they will meet in April to determine if the U.S. has lost its measles-free designation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts fear the vaccine-preventable virus has regained a foothold and that the U.S. &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/canada-loses-measles-elimination-status-1ac3a4bdc7546fac5d8e111bf5196e1e"&gt;may soon follow Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in losing the achievement of having eliminated it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reevaluation is largely symbolic and hinges on whether a single measles chain has spread uninterrupted within the U.S. for at least 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health scientists around the country are investigating whether the now-ended Texas outbreak is linked to active ones in Utah, Arizona and South Carolina. But doctors and scientists say the U.S. — and North America overall — has a measles problem, regardless of the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is really a question of semantics,” said Dr. Jonathan Temte, a Wisconsin family physician who helped certify the U.S. was measles-free in 2000. “The bottom line is the conditions are sufficient to allow this many cases to occur. And that gets back to de-emphasizing a safe and effective vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed 2,144 measles cases across 44 states — &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-us-texas-mmr-vaccine-rfk-144ed193e13de675a750e52a505423e9"&gt;the most since 1991&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — and nearly 50 separate outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem has been years in the making, as &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccination-rates-cdc-kindergarten-0d261546a130dc256735d7b1ff8c6a5f"&gt;fewer kids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; get routine vaccines due to parental waivers, health care access issues and rampant disinformation. More recently, Trump administration health officials have &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccine-safety-mmr-autism-rfk-hepatitis-20d3122d7a9a339cd8447a347bd49928"&gt;questioned&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-autism-vaccines-7b1890f626dd5921fafd00fdd1e6425a"&gt;sown doubt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; about the established safety of vaccines at an unprecedented level while also &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-vaccines-funding-cuts-5785985d6b74024b0502f6a2fc1576e2"&gt;defunding local efforts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to improve vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“The most important thing that we can do is to make sure the people who aren’t vaccinated get vaccinated,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of Brown University’s Pandemic Center. “We have not issued a clear enough message about that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said Thursday that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has consistently emphasized vaccines as the best way to prevent measles, adding that the CDC is responding to outbreaks and working to increase vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Thursday, the department said it doesn’t have evidence that a single chain of measles has spread for a year.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Measles finds the unv&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;accinated&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is little room for error in trying to stop measles. The virus is one of the most contagious, infecting 9 out of every 10 unvaccinated people exposed. Community-level protection takes a 95% vaccination rate. The current rate nationally is 92.5%, according to CDC data, but many communities fall far below that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient in Texas’ first known case developed the telltale rash on Jan. 20, 2025, according to state health department data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, the outbreak exploded. Officially, 762 people fell ill, most of them in &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c"&gt;rural Gaines County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and two children died. Many more got sick and were never diagnosed: 182 potential measles cases among children in Gaines County went unconfirmed in March 2025 alone, state health officials said, a possible undercount of 44% in that county.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Such data gaps are common, though, making it especially hard to track outbreaks. Many people living in communities where the virus is spreading face health care barriers and distrust the government. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact tracing so many cases is also expensive, said behavioral scientist Noel Brewer, who chairs the U.S. committee that will finalize the data for international health officials. Research shows &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-vaccines-health-departments-723baa2b92828b04092475f4763585a6"&gt;a single measles case&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; can cost public health departments &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/2025/estimating-the-financial-costs-of-measles-outbreaks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;tens of thousands of dollars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDC data on measles is still among the best worldwide, Brewer said, but “the U.S. has changed its investment in public health, so we’re less able to do the case tracking that we used to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic sequencing can fill some gaps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s not always enough to say the outbreaks are connected. Genetically, the measles virus doesn’t change as often as, say, flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Within an outbreak, everybody is going to look the same,” said Justin Lessler, a University of North Carolina disease researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key question may then be how PAHO experts will navigate final data gaps, said Dr. Andrew Pavia, a Utah physician and longtime CDC consultant.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“My best guess is we will lose elimination status,” Pavia said. “The case for this not being continuous transmission is tenuous, and I think they are likely to err on the side of declaring it a loss of elimination status.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have confirmed the same measles strain in Texas, New Mexico, Utah, Arizona, South Carolina, Canada, Mexico and several other North American countries, said Sebastian Oliel, a spokesperson for the Pan American Health Organization, which will make the final decision on U.S. measles elimination at an April 13 meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oliel said when there is a case of unknown origin in a country with ongoing local spread, “the most conservative approach is to consider the case part of the existing national transmission.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Mexico also up for review&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAHO will review Mexico’s measles-free status alongside the U.S., Oliel said. That country’s largest outbreak has roots in Texas. It started when an 8-year-old boy from Chihuahua state got sick after visiting family in Seminole, Texas. Since last February, 6,000 people have gotten sick in Mexico, and 21 have died in Chihuahua state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But under PAHO’s definition of elimination, borders matter. If, for example, the chain of measles that started in the U.S. spread to Mexico and then returned to the U.S. anew, it would be considered a new chain, experts said. Still, many experts call that standard outdated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s clear is that measles found ample fertile ground in the U.S. in 2025, infiltrating &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-school-attendance-absences-0384199ace95b4088f60864ce9ec8315"&gt;schools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and day cares, churches, hospital waiting rooms and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-new-mexico-detention-facility-migrants-outbreak-c7f5897ebba85a59548d279c500adaea"&gt;a detention center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. New Mexico logged 100 cases and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-death-new-mexico-texas-outbreak-b9aef6fdd51fbb4ebd1ce9ce28e33299"&gt;one adult died&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Kansas officials spent seven months trying to control an outbreak that sickened nearly 90 people across 10 counties. Ohio confirmed 40 cases. Montana, North Dakota and Wisconsin each had 36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, more than 800 people have gotten sick across Utah, Arizona and South Carolina since late summer, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-south-carolina-utah-arizona-845643cd1342f1ce2ea01d11b74ee77b"&gt;with no end in sight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“2025 was the year of measles,” Brewer said. “Will 2026 be the year of rising or falling measles cases? Does it get worse or does it get better? No one knows the answer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

                &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s plan to blame autism on women using acetaminophen (a.k.a. Tylenol) during pregnancy is getting more pushback from actual scientists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This past weekend, researchers in Europe published a review of the scientific evidence on autism and acetaminophen. After accounting for known biases in past studies, they failed to find a connection between maternal acetaminophen use and a greater risk of autism or other neurodevelopmental conditions in children. The findings indicate that women can continue to safely take the over-the-counter pain and fever medication as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Current evidence does not indicate a clinically important increase in the likelihood of autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, or intellectual disability in children of pregnant individuals who use paracetamol as directed, supporting existing recommendations on its safety,” the researchers wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanogw/article/PIIS3050-5038(25)00211-0/fulltext"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Friday in The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynecology, &amp;amp; Women’s Health.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;No causative link&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last September, President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/trump-and-rfk-jr-blame-tylenol-for-autism-in-new-report-but-experts-push-back-2000662054"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a supposed breakthrough: they found evidence of a potential link between autism and acetaminophen during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though RFK Jr. and other White House officials were somewhat more cautious in their tone, noting that further research would be needed to confirm a causative relationship, Trump was not. At the press conference announcing the findings, he repeatedly told women to immediately stop using acetaminophen. Despite the lack of a smoking gun, the administration also stated it would take regulatory action, such as adding a warning label to acetaminophen products.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many experts at the time, however, rebuffed the administration’s claims. While some studies have suggested a possible link, many others haven’t, including studies explicitly designed to address limitations of observational research. Following Trump’s announcement, the UK and many other countries have &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-the-world-is-reacting-to-trumps-tylenol-autism-scare-2000663086"&gt;continued to endorse&lt;/a&gt; the use of acetaminophen (also called paracetamol in much of the world) during pregnancy. Acetaminophen is the only widely recommended painkiller for pregnant women, since other drugs can have serious side effects, including a &lt;a href="https://medsafe.govt.nz/profs/PUArticles/September2022/Non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory%20drugs-NSAIDs-avoid-use%20in-pregnancy.html#:~:text=NSAID%20use%20in%20early%20pregnancy,some%20cases%2C%20neonatal%20renal%20impairment."&gt;higher risk of miscarriages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In this latest research, scientists in the UK, Sweden, Italy, and elsewhere analyzed data from 43 high-quality studies. Some of these studies compared the outcomes of siblings born to the same mother who reported using acetaminophen during one pregnancy but not the other. Since siblings share many genetic and environmental factors in common, these studies can better account for potential noise in the data.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;All in all, when the researchers included sibling studies in their analysis, they found no significant link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and a greater risk of children developing autism, intellectual disability, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. They also failed to find a link when they only included studies judged to be at low risk of bias.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that previously reported links are likely to be explained by genetic predisposition or other maternal factors such as fever or underlying pain, rather than a direct effect of the paracetamol itself,” said study author Asma Khalil, a professor of obstetrics and maternal fetal medicine at City St George’s, University of London, in a &lt;a href="https://www.citystgeorges.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2026/january2/taking-paracetamol-during-pregnancy-does-not-increase-risk-of-autism-adhd-or-intellectual-disabilities"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The findings echo those of a similar review &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/science-keeps-dismantling-trumps-tylenol-autism-scare-2000683647"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last November, which also failed to find convincing evidence of a causative link between acetaminophen and autism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The major takeaway&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though no drug should be used more than needed, the authors are unequivocal about the implications of their research: Pregnant women shouldn’t be overly stressed about using acetaminophen/paracetamol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The message is clear—paracetamol remains a safe option during pregnancy when taken as guided,” Khalil said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it appears unlikely that this study, or any other independent research, will deter the Trump administration from moving forward with its attempt to scapegoat Tylenol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-makes-bizarre-connection-between-circumcision-tylenol-and-autism-2000670971"&gt;White House Cabinet meeting&lt;/a&gt; discussing the report in early October, RFK Jr. acknowledged that the government did not have proof that acetaminophen can cause autism. Immediately after, however, he stated, “We’re doing the studies to make the proof.”&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;We’ve got great news for everyone who’s ever been kept awake until the wee hours of the morning by a family member or housemate screaming obscenities at their monitor while playing video games. Your lectures about how playing video games for so long isn’t healthy now have new scientific justification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899900725003685?via%3Dihub"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this month in the journal Nutrition found an association between gaming more than 10 hours a week and poor diet quality, higher body mass, and lower sleep quality. The research suggests that playing video games isn’t the main problem, but overdoing the amount of time dedicated to it, according to Mario Siervo, a co-author of the study from the Curtin School of Population Health.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Hardcore gaming might impact health&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What stood out was students gaming up to 10 hours a week all looked very similar in terms of diet, sleep and body weight,” he said in a Curtin University &lt;a href="https://www.curtin.edu.au/news/media-release/study-reveals-how-many-hours-of-video-games-per-week-might-be-too-many/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “The real differences emerged in those gaming more than 10 hours a week, who showed clear divergence from the rest of the sample.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Siervo and his coworkers worked with over 300 students from Australian universities who self-reported how much time they spent gaming per week. Based on this information, the team organized them into three categories—low gamers (0 to 5 hours of gaming per week), moderate gamers (5 to 10 hours per week), and high gamers (more than 10 hours per week).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Low and moderate gamers described similar health statuses, which were significantly worse for high gamers. For example, the researchers noted lower diet quality for high gamers. Heavy gamers were more likely to be obese, with a median BMI of 26.3. By comparison, low and moderate gamers had healthier averages of 22.2 and 22.8, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Each additional hour of gaming per week was linked to a decline in diet quality, even after accounting for stress, physical activity and other lifestyle factors,” Siervo explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Poor sleep quality&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re trying to argue against your household gamer logging 10 hours a week, sleep quality might be your strongest case. In the study, all three categories reported poor sleep quality overall, though moderate and high gamers had lower scores than low gamers. The study found an important association between gaming hours and sleep disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This study doesn’t prove gaming causes these issues, but it shows a clear pattern that excessive gaming may be linked to an increase in health risk factors,” Siervo clarified. “Our data suggests low and moderate gaming is generally fine, but excessive gaming may crowd out healthy habits such as eating a balanced diet, sleeping properly and staying active.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To which he added: “Because university habits often follow people into adulthood, healthier routines such as taking breaks from gaming, avoiding playing games late at night and choosing healthier snacks may help improve their overall wellbeing.”&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

But new research suggests that there could be a specific culprit to blame: certain preservatives—and these show up in more foods than just processed meats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/392/bmj-2025-084917" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The BMJ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The BMJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, is opening up more questions about associations between processed foods and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/dena-champion" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dena Champion, R.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dena Champion, R.D&lt;/a&gt;., an oncology dietitian at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center – James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute; &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/general-surgery/ca/santa-monica/anton-bilchik-1609916733" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Anton Bilchik, M.D., Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Anton Bilchik, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, surgical oncologist, chief of medicine and director of the Gastrointestinal and Hepatobiliary Program at Providence Saint John’s Cancer Institute in Santa Monica, CA; Jessica Cording, R.D., author of &lt;em&gt;The Little Book of Game-Changers: 50 Healthy Habits For Managing Stress &amp;amp; Anxiety&lt;/em&gt;; Lisa Moskovitz, R.D., founder of &lt;a href="https://www.nynutritiongroup.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The NY Nutrition Group;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The NY Nutrition Group &lt;/a&gt;and author of &lt;em&gt;The Core 3 Healthy Eating Plan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers looked at diet and health data from more than 105,000 people between 2009 and 2023. On the dietary front, researchers specifically looked at the impact of 17 different preservatives on a range of health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the researchers found there wasn’t a link between &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; types of preservatives and a higher risk of cancer, they found clear associations between some preservatives and specific types of cancer. Those included:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potassium sorbate and breast cancer, overall cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potassium metabisulfite and overall cancer, breast cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sodium nitrite and prostate cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potassium nitrate and overall cancer, breast cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acetic acid and overall cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sodium erythorbate and overall cancer, breast cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the majority of preservatives (11 out of 17) were not linked with a higher risk of cancer. So, what’s behind this and, more importantly, what should you take away from the latest research? Here’s what the data found, plus what experts suggest. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What foods do these preservatives show up in?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s where things get surprising. While plenty of people were exposed to these preservatives through processed meats, there were other, less obvious sources. Those include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why might these preservatives be linked to cancer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the researchers found a link between certain preservatives and cancer, they didn’t dive into why this association exists. Still, this is “likely to be a combination of factors,” including the composition of the foods these preservatives are used in, says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/general-surgery/ca/santa-monica/anton-bilchik-1609916733" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Anton Bilchik, M.D., Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Anton Bilchik, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, surgical oncologist, chief of medicine, and director of the Gastrointestinal and Hepatobiliary Program at Providence Saint John’s Cancer Institute in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bilchik points out that the exact way these preservatives impact the body and affect cancer risk isn’t well known. “Some &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166445X22002065" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; show that preservatives like nitrates and nitrites change the immune environment and can change the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10915207/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gut microbiome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in genetic alterations of cells,” he says. “But there’s a lot more work to better understand the exact relationship of these preservatives and the development of cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/dena-champion" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dena Champion, R.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dena Champion, R.D&lt;/a&gt;., an oncology dietitian at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center—James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute, agrees, and says it’s important not to panic. "We cannot say that the preservatives caused the cancer—there may be many other factors that led to that diagnosis,” she says. But in addition to impacting the gut bacteria, Champion points out that some preservatives may promote inflammation in the body. (Inflammation is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11592557/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:linked;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to a host of serious diseases, including cancer.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for why some of these preservatives were linked to cancer and others weren’t, Champion says it may come down to their chemical structure and how our bodies metabolize preservatives. “Some are broken down and eliminated easily, while others may undergo chemical changes in the body that could be more problematic,” Champion says. “The bottom line is that some preservatives appear more concerning than others based on this research, which is actually helpful information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, it’s important to remember that the study didn’t find that foods that contained these preservatives &lt;em&gt;caused&lt;/em&gt; cancer. “We have to remember correlation does not always equal causation,” says Lisa Moskovitz, R.D., founder of &lt;a href="https://www.nynutritiongroup.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The NY Nutrition Group;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The NY Nutrition Group&lt;/a&gt; and author of &lt;em&gt;The Core 3 Healthy Eating Plan&lt;/em&gt;. “Preservatives are most abundant in foods that have excess added sugar, saturated fat, and other ingredients that can drive up cancer risk,” she says. Moskovitz also points out that it’s possible that people who eat a lot of foods with preservatives may not be eating a sufficient amount of cancer-fighting foods, like fresh fruit, veggies, and other antioxidant-rich, plant-based foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the reason, the study’s authors call for more investigation into the link. “These findings may have important public health implications given the ubiquitous use of these additives in a wide range of foods and beverages,” they wrote in the study. They also noted that the findings present “new insights for the future re-evaluation of the safety of these food additives by health agencies, considering the balance between benefit and risk for food preservation and cancer.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to entirely avoid preservatives in food, but you can make a conscious decision to minimize how much preservatives you take in, points out Jessica Cording, R.D., author of &lt;em&gt;The Little Book of Game-Changers: 50 Healthy Habits For Managing Stress &amp;amp; Anxiety&lt;/em&gt;. “In general, a lot of the foods that [preservatives] are added to are not very nutrient-dense,” she says. “Regardless of the specific preservative, you’re not getting much in the way of protective benefits from those foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bilchik agrees. “We really need to think carefully about what we order, what we eat,” he says. That includes focusing on shopping the outer sections of the grocery store first (these tend to feature fresh produce, dairy, and meats), before making your way to the center aisles. “These are foods that are not necessarily processed to last for long periods of time,” Dr. Bilchik says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is just another reason to encourage people to eat more minimally-processed foods that have a lot of nutrients that have been shown to help protect against cancer,” Cording says. “Does that mean you can’t enjoy the occasional deli sandwich or ketchup on your burger with a glass of wine? Absolutely not,” Moskovitz says. “Not only is that unrealistic, but unnecessary if you have an otherwise healthy lifestyle and balanced diet. ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dr. Bilchik notes that there’s more to cancer risk than preservatives, making this just one part of cancer prevention. “Genetic factors are certainly one part, and we cannot control those,” he says. “In terms of lifestyle, exercise, avoiding smoking, stress reduction...there are so many other factors involved in cancer reduction other than what we eat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 14:40:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOWEZIeVZ6dnVWdTF0dkt5ZFEwRkktc1B6V1ZhbE5IU1EwVHNtb2dQSE80SkZsOVFnNDFwYlo5Y095WVpWeVRwQ24yWUNqZjFWazdSLWtxenhZdEYzYVUza013bENpVWVWSmdBcWswOTdZTm5PZ3U5NHJKbVF3TjJJeldYcjM4TWV0aC1Z</guid></item><item><title>增强免疫系统无效的5种方法（浪费$ 100s ） -金钱谈话新闻</title><link>https://www.moneytalksnews.com/ways-to-boost-your-immune-system-that-dont-work-and-waste-s/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Money Talks News</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 14:29:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxQeElLLVVRZWsxcWRsdWpxbDhOano0VkRwYXc4aElLQ1N3aXZ3TTVpQW5Ob1RuaUlBQTUzMklEem5odFBCdTZzZTkyNzdVSTNEVjN6WVI3VVNWVGg3T2tMbjdINjB1dlh6QTV0NXQxLUZTOUQ2cGlOYnZtVUhfNGtERHFXeUtpcFhzMXJVMER5Vm5XZl9vZmc</guid></item><item><title>美国麻疹疫情创纪录的一年。这可能是致命卷土重来的开始- KSL新闻</title><link>https://www.ksl.com/article/51435585/us-had-record-breaking-year-for-measles-it-may-be-the-start-of-a-deadly-comeback</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;DALLAS — Tuesday marks one year since a measles outbreak started in west Texas, and there have been new cases in the United States each week since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas reported more than 760 cases — and the deaths of two children – before declaring the outbreak over in August. It was the largest outbreak the US had seen in decades, and since then, other large outbreaks — one in the upstate region of South Carolina and another on the border of Utah and Arizona — have amassed hundreds of cases each and continue to expand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first two weeks of 2026 have been some of the worst yet, with exposures reported at schools, churches, restaurants, shops, airports and more. The continuous spread of measles over the past year leaves the US at risk of losing elimination status, which the country has held since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is startling, because just a few years ago, measles was very rare in the United States," said Dr. Caitlin Rivers, ​an epidemiologist and director of the Center for Outbreak Response Innovation at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now we're seeing in a single week what we might have seen in an average year," she said. "There's been a real shift in the presence of this preventable disease in our life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether that balance can shift back depends on how quickly the US can improve vaccination coverage, experts say – which, in many ways, has become an uphill battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US reported more than 2,200 confirmed measles cases in 2025 — significantly more than there have been in any year since measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000. At least ​171 measles cases have been reported in the first two weeks of 2026, which is nearly as many as the average annual total in those 25 years since elimination in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of cases — more than 95% — have been in people who had not been vaccinated with the recommended two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts fear that the situation may have to get much worse before it gets better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's particularly devastating, they say, because the illnesses and deaths they foresee are almost entirely preventable with the help of vaccines — but lagging coverage has left many vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not clear yet whether the US will maintain its measles elimination status. In April, the Pan American Health Organization, part of the World Health Organization, will formally make the determination. The decision will require a detailed review of epidemiological and laboratory evidence to understand patterns of measles spread over the past year — including whether more recent outbreaks are linked to the Texas outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But experts say that formally losing measles elimination status would be a symptom of more deeply rooted issues, particularly challenges with vaccination that have been building for many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's face it, whether we lose elimination status or not in spring, is our public health system actually doing well?" said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, who resigned in protest last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Measles elimination is a vital sign of our public health system. That public health system is blue in the ICU," he said. "I don't need to check its pulse to know [it's not doing well]. I know the answer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A record share of U.S. kindergartners had an exemption for a required vaccination last school year, according to data from the CDC, marking the fifth year in a row that coverage with the MMR vaccine was below the federal target of 95%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC says that the increase in vaccine exemptions may be "due to an increase in vaccine hesitancy." A recent &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/pubs-resources/parental-attitudes-toward-vaccination-requirements.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; of parents conducted by the agency found that most supported vaccine requirements to attend school. But among those seeking an exemption, the most commonly reported reason – cited more than a third of the time – was a philosophical or personal belief objection to vaccination. Difficulty meeting school requirements by the deadline was also reported as a reason for exemption by about 23% of parents. Medical reasons were cited by more than a quarter of parents, but the CDC said that might include parents who consider concerns about vaccine safety or side effects as a "medical" reason to request an exemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vaccines are a victim of their own success. It's not just that we eliminated measles. I think we eliminated the memory of measles," said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offit remembers speaking with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC557162/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Maurice Hilleman&lt;/a&gt;, a microbiologist who developed the MMR vaccine and dozens of others, just months before Hilleman's death in 2005. Measles cases had reached a record low in 2004 but were starting to trend up again, just a few years after the US had achieved elimination following a long and hard-fought battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I asked him, 'Do you think that we can educate people about the importance of the vaccine, about the serious nature of this disease, or does the virus have to come back?" Offit said. He said there was a tear in his eye when he replied that the virus was going to have to come back to teach that lesson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That was an enormous defeat for him," Offit said. "It's an enormous defeat for us to once again see children be exposed to something that could kill them — and did kill them – in this country, when that was completely unnecessary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it seems more and more that the virus isn't necessarily doing that, educating either, Offit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were three deaths from measles last year — as many as there had been over the past 25 years combined — yet it's been a struggle to increase vaccination rates, even in communities that experienced outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The South Carolina health department has offered a mobile vaccination clinic since the early weeks of the outbreak in the upstate region of the state, but state epidemiologist Dr. Linda Bell has said that uptake has been "disappointing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles outbreaks tend to occur in under-vaccinated pockets of the U.S., often in tight-knit communities, such as those with certain religious beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

But interpreting what those markers mean for an individual remains a major challenge, and different labs vary in their methodology, leading to differing results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We are still in the infancy of understanding how to interpret them,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="bc737553-b5e0-4164-bf4f-bcdaf3c83cde" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":7,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Crunch time: are freeze-dried fruit and veg actually healthy to eat or just chips in a different form? | Antiviral","elementId":"bc737553-b5e0-4164-bf4f-bcdaf3c83cde","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/24/freeze-dried-fruit-veg-healthy-food-nutrition-benefits"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":8,"display":0,"theme":1},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If a gut microbiome test is ordered by a specialist doctor or accredited dietitian with a clear clinical reason, sent to a reputable lab, and interpreted by someone trained to make sense of the results, it can be genuinely helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Leong recently saw a patient with inflammatory bowel disease and rectal bleeding who had already undergone standard medical tests. The microbiome results, in that case, helped confirm dietary issues and guide further treatment once simple and important issues had been ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But these cases are the exception, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A healthy mix of organisms in one person could be problematic in another; “The same organism has different species and acts differently in different individuals,” Leong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It means for the vast majority of people who order these tests online, and who may be curious about their gut health or wondering about their symptoms or foods to avoid, “there are no translatable benefits” to ordering a test, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Temporary dietary changes, medications or illness could all affect the results, and what those results actually mean for an individual’s health outcomes isn’t well understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="false-alarms-can-cause-distress" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;False alarms can cause distress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One of Leong’s patients who took a commercial home test came to him panicking about bowel cancer after the report suggested she had certain inflammatory markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Leong said a colonoscopy remains the definitive test to investigate bowel polyps and cancers. The free home bowel screening test issued by the Australian government, which looks for hidden blood in stool, is an evidence-based way to detect early warning signs of bowel cancer and may prompt follow-up testing, including a colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And while some home gut microbiome tests claim to offer insights into metabolism or inflammation, “very few experts can use these results appropriately at present,” Leong said, including gastroenterologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This is because clinicians aren’t trained to interpret the complex outputs the tests generate, the science is still developing, and there aren’t clear guidelines on what to do with the information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-illusion-of-control" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;The illusion of control&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At-home microbiome tests are spruiked by online influencers as a way of empowering people who want more insights into their health.

ROACH: I am an 80-year-old female on Eliquis who has many bruises on her legs that do not go away. Is there a remedy for this situation? -- R.D.T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="X5Y5EU4HUBGYBERYHSROISNVMU"&gt;ANSWER: Eliquis is an anticoagulant; it reduces the body’s ability to make blood clots by affecting clotting factors. We are all constantly breaking small blood vessels, but in people in their 80s, blood vessels are a bit more fragile and are prone to break with minor trauma. Even people who aren’t on anticoagulants can develop bruising on their arms or legs. But when a person is on apixaban (Eliquis) or a similar drug, the anticoagulant is most likely the cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TWJ7BOIGYBA5ZKDPI5YLAESYNE"&gt;Some nutrients that are found in fruits and vegetables can help the blood vessels stay stronger, so a healthy diet is probably your best bet to reduce bruising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GDUDW24QKBFYZIGOSYVWYMBOIE"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: How is “wet brain” (or Wernicke encephalopathy, WE) diagnosed? My son has been in the hospital, a rehab facility, and now an assisted living facility. Is there hope that he may walk again? He does not have any motivation and stays in bed most days playing on his phone. He hates being at a retirement home because he is 45, but he can’t take care of himself. He has lost his family and career because of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5244BEWNMFFGBGRDVJ5EDGGCW4"&gt;The physical therapist told me that he has wet brain. The doctor said it is a neuropathy and that his brain is shrinking. Please advise; we are seeking help for him to get better and out on his own. -- M.L.J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IKJZAZR2NZCBVFWR3VBXVK3A4I"&gt;ANSWER: WE is caused by a lack of thiamine (vitamin B1). (I had never heard the term “wet brain” to describe this illness, but I see it used sometimes. When I hear “wet brain,” I think of hydrocephalus, a condition of too much fluid in the brain, but this is clearly not what you are asking about.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="L2JPZYPTGRAARAOV7G5ZTFL4UQ"&gt;Over 90% of cases of WE are associated with alcohol use. People with chronic, heavy alcohol use often do not get adequate thiamine from food, and in addition, alcohol can affect the absorption of thiamine and its storage in the liver. It is likely that there are genetic variants of metabolic enzymes that predispose a person to getting WE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MXLR5O5BZBB2DH3F7QHL7CZEY4"&gt;There are three classic findings in WE. The first is encephalopathy, which is characterized by disorientation, a poor attention span, and general indifference. Expert exams reveal the second issue: paralysis of certain eye muscles. Gait abnormalities are the third set of classic findings, with a gait where the feet are wide apart, consisting of slow steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VMQVSVD7HRCKHLTRVCHOXNVOKQ"&gt;Both the eye movement and gait disorders are a type of neuropathy caused by low thiamine. His doctor mentions shrinking of the brain (“atrophy”), which is common in WE but not at all specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="F6WBLGKHLFGCLGZ6RDNLEOAI7A"&gt;A late manifestation of the encephalopathy is a condition called Korsakoff syndrome, in which there is profound amnesia. Some people develop confabulation -- making up stories that are completely untrue but make sense in the context of a conversation. It is thought that people with Korsakoff syndrome are unaware of their condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TDIEMCJW5VCBZN5JYRG2LKAIYE"&gt;I wish I had better news for your son on the possibility of recovery, as only rapid and immediate administration of thiamine is effective at resolving symptoms.

&lt;p&gt;Scientific consensus on the biological mechanisms underpinning &lt;strong&gt;sunburn&lt;/strong&gt; has remained largely unchanged for decades. The prevailing view posited that &lt;strong&gt;ultraviolet (UV) radiation&lt;/strong&gt; induces DNA mutations in skin cells, triggering inflammatory responses and initiating cell death to prevent carcinogenesis. This framework has shaped dermatological education, cancer research funding priorities, and public health messaging across high-UV index regions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the &lt;a href="https://www.ku.dk/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;University of Copenhagen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nanyang Technological University (NTU Singapore)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; identified a different primary trigger. Through controlled experiments involving both murine and human epidermal models, the study demonstrated that the &lt;strong&gt;initial cellular response to UVB exposure is governed by RNA damage&lt;/strong&gt;, not DNA lesions. This distinction alters the molecular understanding of &lt;strong&gt;cutaneous inflammation&lt;/strong&gt; and raises new questions about the mechanisms of UV-induced cell signaling.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1097276524008840" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Molecular Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, have attracted growing attention from &lt;strong&gt;biomedical regulatory agencies&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;skin disease researchers&lt;/strong&gt; exploring alternative models of &lt;strong&gt;UV damage signaling&lt;/strong&gt;. In mouse models lacking the ZAK alpha kinase gene, a key regulator in ribosomal stress detection, typical UV-induced responses such as keratinocyte death and epidermal swelling were suppressed. This suggests that ZAK alpha’s activation by &lt;strong&gt;damaged messenger RNA (mRNA)&lt;/strong&gt; precedes and may override DNA-dependent pathways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;RNA Damage as the Signal Origin&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The core mechanism centers on what researchers described as the &lt;strong&gt;ribotoxic stress response (RSR)&lt;/strong&gt;. Upon UVB exposure, damaged mRNA triggers ZAK alpha to initiate inflammatory signaling and programmed cell death. “We found that the first thing the cells respond to after being exposed to UV radiation is damage to the RNA,” said Simon Bekker-Jensen, professor of molecular medicine at the University of Copenhagen, “and that this is what triggers cell death and inflammation of the skin.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ZAK-knockout-mice-1200x1200.jpeg.webp" alt="Zak Knockout Mice" class="wp-image-117964" srcset="https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ZAK-knockout-mice-scaled.jpeg.webp 1200w,https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ZAK-knockout-mice-420x420.jpeg.webp 420w,https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ZAK-knockout-mice-160x160.jpeg.webp 160w,https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ZAK-knockout-mice-520x520.jpeg.webp 520w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;RNA damage from UV-B activates ZAKα, triggering a stress response in skin cells. The pathway leads to cytokine production, cell death (via JNK and p38), and inflammation. In mouse models, wild-type mice showed typical sunburn responses—immune cell infiltration and epidermal thickening—while ZAKα knockout mice did not, confirming ZAKα’s key role in mediating UV-induced skin inflammation. Credit: Molecular Cell Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In knockout mice lacking the &lt;strong&gt;ZAK gene&lt;/strong&gt;, those acute inflammatory markers were notably absent. In vitro tests using cultured human keratinocytes revealed the same pathway activation: &lt;strong&gt;RNA damage&lt;/strong&gt; activated pyroptotic and apoptotic death via the &lt;strong&gt;p38&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;JNK&lt;/strong&gt; signaling routes, respectively. This dual-pathway activation reinforces the premise that ZAK alpha governs &lt;strong&gt;early UV stress responses&lt;/strong&gt; through cytoplasmic signals rather than nuclear genome surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Friction Point: Diagnostic, Therapeutic, and Textbook Realignment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The immediate friction point is conceptual and infrastructural. &lt;strong&gt;Sunscreen formulations&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;UV protection protocols&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;dermatological interventions&lt;/strong&gt; have historically been modeled around DNA-centric assumptions. The shift toward RNA-first mechanisms compels a reevaluation of &lt;strong&gt;photoimmunology models&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly for inflammatory conditions such as &lt;strong&gt;polymorphic light eruption&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;UV-aggravated eczema&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, ZAK alpha’s role as a molecular sentinel introduces both &lt;strong&gt;therapeutic targets&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;diagnostic markers&lt;/strong&gt;. Potential pharmaceutical interventions that modulate the RSR pathway may offer new methods for &lt;strong&gt;controlling UV-induced skin inflammation&lt;/strong&gt;, independent of mutagenic &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/08/chernobyls-dogs-are-transforming-at-record-speed-what-radiation-is-really-doing-to-their-dna/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="97247" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DNA repair processes&lt;/a&gt;. However, these applications remain theoretical; as of January 2026, no ZAK alpha inhibitors have entered clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The research, conducted by faculty at the &lt;a href="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/organisations/institut-for-cellul%C3%A6r-og-molekyl%C3%A6r-medicin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Copenhagen, in collaboration with NTU’s &lt;em&gt;Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, indicates a broader need for academic and medical reassessment. Assistant Professor Anna Constance Vind, a co-author of the study, noted, “This new knowledge turns things upside down. I think most people associate sunburn with DNA damage; it is established knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Educational and clinical materials reliant on DNA-centric inflammation models will likely need revision to include the role of RNA and ribosomal stress pathways. Key areas of impact include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical curricula&lt;/strong&gt; covering dermatology, cell signaling, and photobiology&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Textbooks and training programs&lt;/strong&gt; for dermatologists and general practitioners&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical diagnostics&lt;/strong&gt; involving inflammatory skin responses to UV&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drug discovery pipelines&lt;/strong&gt; targeting early UV damage detection and response&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether this RNA-centric model applies uniformly across skin types, UV spectrum ranges, and environmental exposure durations remains under investigation. The interaction between &lt;strong&gt;long-term DNA mutations&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;acute RNA signaling&lt;/strong&gt; is also unresolved; they may operate on separate timelines, with independent but complementary biological effects.&lt;/p&gt;

To estimate smoke exposure, researchers used a model to estimate levels of PM 2.5 at each individual’s home address during their pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a650f6" class="body-graf"&gt;“This paper supports other scientific research that links prenatal exposure to air pollution, particularly PM 2.5 to autism,” said Alycia Halladay, chief science officer at the nonprofit Autism Science Foundation, who was not involved in the study. “The size of the risk is not huge, but it is consistent with other research and adds to a body of scientific literature linking air pollution and autism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-44f120" class="body-graf"&gt;“Both autism and wildfires are on the rise, and this study is just the beginning of investigating links between the two,” said senior study author Mostafijur Rahman, an assistant professor of environmental health sciences at Tulane University’s Celia Scott Weatherhead School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-50e48b" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How big is the risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-31960f" class="body-graf"&gt;The study analyzed health records of more than 200,000 births in Southern California from 2006 through 2014. California, the researchers said, leads the country in both yearly acres burned by wildfire and rates of childhood autism diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dc4040" class="body-graf"&gt;The increased risk was strongest when mothers were exposed to wildfire smoke during the third trimester (the last three months of pregnancy), especially during stretches of multiple smoky days, rather than from overall average pollution levels alone, the study found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b56af5" class="body-graf"&gt;The risk of autism diagnosis was about 10% higher for children whose mothers experienced 1 to 5 smokey days in the third trimester, 12% higher with 6 to 10 days and 23% higher with more than 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-afa41f" class="body-graf"&gt;The association was clearest among women who didn’t change residences during pregnancy, suggesting that sustained exposure in the same location — not just occasional smoke — may play an important role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8b0fed" class="body-graf"&gt;The study, however, doesn’t explain why wildfire smoke may increase autism risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1226a9" class="body-graf"&gt;Rahman said wildfire smoke is quite different from other pollutants, such as traffic pollutants, that people are exposed to on an almost everyday basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a687f2" class="body-graf"&gt;“Wildfire smoke has a unique chemical composition,” he said, “including higher levels of carbon compounds, metal, toxic byproducts, and it tends to occur in intense and short term spikes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1ec2e6" class="body-graf"&gt;The third trimester is a critical period in a fetus’s development, said lead study author David Luglio, a post-doctoral fellow with the Celia Scott Weatherhead School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e932f4" class="body-graf"&gt;“In terms of the brain, and the late trimester, this is when the brain really grows in size and develops its main centers,” he said. He added that the findings shouldn’t cause alarm, noting that autism isn’t limited to environmental factors, but is also believed to have a strong genetic component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b698aa" class="body-graf"&gt;Halladay said exposure to high levels of PM 2.5 have already been linked to lower birthweight, higher levels of preterm births, asthma and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-581c97" class="body-graf"&gt;“So close monitoring, as well as mitigation of air pollution, should be a priority for regulatory agencies going forward,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-3c3570" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More research is needed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0b1b46" class="body-graf"&gt;Autism spectrum disorder — characterized by challenges with social and communication skills and by repetitive behaviors — affects 1 in 31 school-aged children in the United States, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/autism-rates-up-cdc-report-2025-rfk-jr-rcna201305" target="_blank"&gt;the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2cb9dd" class="body-graf"&gt;The disorder is believed to be “multifactorial,” said Dr. Akhgar Ghassabian, an associate professor of pediatrics and population health at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, with several environmental factors “shown to be involved, particularly if these environmental exposures happen during early life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b37db5" class="body-graf"&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., with the backing of President Donald Trump, has made autism a high-profile research priority, saying that health officials want to better understand the condition’s “root causes,” including potential environmental causes, such as air pollution, chemicals and medicine. Kennedy has also promoted unproven treatments, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-touted-drug-leucovorin-autism-families-already-tried-rcna233291" target="_blank"&gt;including leucovorin&lt;/a&gt;, a synthetic form of vitamin B9 or folate, which the body needs to make healthy blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9953b7" class="body-graf"&gt;In September, Trump claimed without new evidence that acetaminophen — the active ingredient in the pain reliever Tylenol — was a cause of autism, a statement that drew intense pushback from OB-GYNs, autism advocacy groups and international health organizations, like the World Health Organization. A large new analysis found &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/tylenol-pregnancy-safe-no-link-autism-trump-kennedy-rcna253662" target="_blank"&gt;no link between acetaminophen and autism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cc643c" class="body-graf"&gt;David Mandell, a psychiatry professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said the idea that wildfire smoke exposure could raise autism risk is broadly consistent with previous research linking air pollution exposure during the mother's pregnancy to poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d5490c" class="body-graf"&gt;But he said that he was cautious about how the study’s findings were interpreted, noting that the observed effects were small and that the highest exposure group did not show a clear increase in risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8f8a9e" class="body-graf"&gt;“They do see a more elevated risk at the second-highest exposure level in the third trimester among nonmovers, but not at the highest exposure level,” Mandell said. “This lack of a dose response makes me skeptical about the findings. I’d definitely want to see a replication before I put a lot of stock in it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ce563b" class="body-graf"&gt;The authors note the study has limitations: Exposure estimates were based on outdoor air, and researchers don’t know how much smoke people were exposed to indoors, or whether they used air filters, wore masks or altered their behavior during a wildfire event. Rahman said further studies are still needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e4babe" class="body-graf"&gt;The findings, he said, “reinforce the importance of minimizing smoke exposure during a wildfire event when possible and following the public health guidance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-413477" class="body-graf"&gt;Mandell said that he hopes an administration "truly interested in improving child outcomes would strengthen" the Environmental Protection Agency and strengthen the Federal Emergency Management Agency "to reduce pollution and help families cope.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9d2c20" class="body-graf"&gt;“This administration seems to be going in the absolute opposite direction,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-06a458" class="body-graf"&gt;Rahman said he is also curious whether prevention — such as masks or air purifiers — may reduce the risk seen in the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-98c81a" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Wildfire smoke is a potentially preventable environmental exposure,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:00:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNWi1pUkV5ZEI2WUtsR0tFYTJ2V2dtekZWd3dNb0tiaTJFbHl6N2FINHZFbWR6MDhRc2psTEE1XzJJcVBuemxKODhrcWlSblFnc2F6ZUVKMnlCc25nTzh3eVFVYS1URFZNV01tRnBkNFZTc2c5cnJteS00YldJdTR3Q0JtaEJQQl9yRjhrUG16bG5kT1g2RmN4c2lMVUkzczFWY3gycmpvTzlHNDNURXhF</guid></item><item><title>当您不睡觉时，您的大脑会做一些令人惊讶的事情- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260119234937.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;Nearly everyone knows the feeling. After a night of poor sleep, it becomes harder to stay focused. Thoughts drift, reaction times slow, and mental clarity fades when attention is needed most.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New research from MIT sheds light on what is happening inside the brain during these brief lapses in focus. The study shows that when attention momentarily fails, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) moves out of the brain, a process that normally happens during sleep and helps clear away waste that accumulates throughout the day. This cleansing activity is considered important for keeping the brain healthy and functioning properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone is sleep-deprived, the body appears to try to make up for lost rest by triggering bursts of this fluid movement during wakefulness. That compensation, however, comes with a significant downside: sharply reduced attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you don't sleep, the CSF waves start to intrude into wakefulness where normally you wouldn't see them. However, they come with an attentional tradeoff, where attention fails during the moments that you have this wave of fluid flow," says Laura Lewis, the Athinoula A. Martinos Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, a member of MIT's Institute for Medical Engineering and Science and the Research Laboratory of Electronics, and an associate member of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis is the senior author of the study, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;. MIT postdoctoral associate Zinong Yang is the lead author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Sleep Cleans the Brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep is essential for survival, yet scientists still do not fully understand why it plays such a critical role. What is clear is that sleep is necessary for staying alert, and that losing sleep reliably harms attention and other mental abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important function of sleep involves cerebrospinal fluid, which surrounds and cushions the brain. During sleep, CSF helps flush out waste that builds up during waking hours. In a 2019 study, Lewis and her colleagues found that this fluid moves in a rhythmic pattern as people sleep, closely linked to shifts in brain wave activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That earlier discovery raised a new question: what happens to this fluid system when sleep is disrupted? To find out, the researchers recruited 26 volunteers who completed testing twice, once after a night of sleep deprivation in the lab and once after being well-rested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following morning, participants completed a standard task used to assess the effects of sleep loss while researchers tracked a wide range of brain and body signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measuring Attention and Brain Fluid Flow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the experiment, each participant wore an electroencephalogram (EEG) cap to monitor brain activity while lying inside a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner. The team used a specialized version of fMRI that could track both blood oxygen levels and the movement of CSF in and out of the brain. Heart rate, breathing rate, and pupil size were also recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants completed two attention tests inside the scanner, one visual and one auditory. In the visual task, they watched a fixed cross on a screen that occasionally changed into a square. They were instructed to press a button whenever the change occurred. In the auditory task, the visual cue was replaced by a sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, sleep-deprived participants performed significantly worse than when they were well-rested. Their reactions were slower, and in some cases they failed to notice the signal entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When these brief attention failures occurred, the researchers observed multiple physiological changes happening at the same time. Most notably, CSF moved outward from the brain during the lapse and then flowed back in once attention returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The results are suggesting that at the moment that attention fails, this fluid is actually being expelled outward away from the brain. And when attention recovers, it's drawn back in," Lewis says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team believes this pattern reflects the brain's attempt to compensate for missed sleep by activating a cleaning process that normally occurs at night, even though doing so temporarily disrupts attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One way to think about those events is because your brain is so in need of sleep, it tries its best to enter into a sleep-like state to restore some cognitive functions," Yang says. "Your brain's fluid system is trying to restore function by pushing the brain to iterate between high-attention and high-flow states."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Brain and Body System Working Together&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed that attention lapses are linked to changes beyond the brain itself. During these moments, breathing and heart rate slowed, and pupils became smaller. Pupil constriction began roughly 12 seconds before CSF moved out of the brain and reversed after attention returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What's interesting is it seems like this isn't just a phenomenon in the brain, it's also a body-wide event. It suggests that there's a tight coordination of these systems, where when your attention fails, you might feel it perceptually and psychologically, but it's also reflecting an event that's happening throughout the brain and body," Lewis says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that a single control system may coordinate both attention and basic bodily functions such as fluid flow, heart rate, and alertness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results suggest to us that there's a unified circuit that's governing both what we think of as very high-level functions of the brain -- our attention, our ability to perceive and respond to the world -- and then also really basic fundamental physiological processes like fluid dynamics of the brain, brain-wide blood flow, and blood vessel constriction," Lewis says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the researchers did not identify the specific circuit involved, they point to the noradrenergic system as a strong candidate. This system, which uses the neurotransmitter norepinephrine to regulate cognition and bodily functions, is known to fluctuate during normal sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was supported by the National Institutes of Health, a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Research Fellowship, a NAWA Fellowship, a McKnight Scholar Award, a Sloan Fellowship, a Pew Biomedical Scholar Award, a One Mind Rising Star Award, and the Simons Collaboration on Plasticity in the Aging Brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljntw200003b6sk8birl15@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Tuesday marks one year since a measles outbreak started in West Texas, and there have been new cases in the United States each week since.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmklkveu400063b6s3rznp2io@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Texas reported more than 760 cases — and the deaths of two children – before declaring the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/18/health/texas-measles-outbreak-declared-over"&gt;outbreak over&lt;/a&gt; in August. It was the largest outbreak the US had seen in decades, and since then, other large outbreaks — one in the upstate region of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/08/health/south-carolina-measles-outbreak-challenges"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; and another on the border of Utah and Arizona — have amassed hundreds of cases each and continue to expand.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmklmnmms00003b6p6514ffko@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The first two weeks of 2026 have been some of the worst yet, with &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/15/health/measles-exposure-what-to-do-wellness"&gt;exposures&lt;/a&gt; reported at schools, churches, restaurants, shops, airports and more. The continuous spread of measles over the past year leaves the US at &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/09/health/measles-elimination-investigation"&gt;risk of losing elimination status&lt;/a&gt;, which the country has held since 2000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmklleh3k00023b6se27yx7ym@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is startling, because just a few years ago measles was very rare in the United States,” said Dr. Caitlin Rivers, ​an epidemiologist and director of the Center for Outbreak Response Innovation at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkllgjel00053b6s9l2ll65n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Now we’re seeing in a single week what we might have seen in an average year,” she said. “There’s been a real shift in the presence of this preventable disease in our life.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmklni3my00063b6puk4qsw4z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whether that balance can shift back depends on how quickly the US can improve vaccination coverage, experts say – which, in many ways, has become an uphill battle.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkllgsy000083b6s3na67xuy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US reported more than 2,200 confirmed measles cases in 2025 — significantly more than there have been in any year since measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000. At least ​171 measles cases have been reported in the first two weeks of 2026, which is nearly as many as the average annual total in those 25 years since elimination in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmklllcmx000c3b6sx5ue5xi5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vast majority of cases — more than 95% — have been in people who had not been vaccinated with the recommended two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljkbef006p27nxb77a4ckg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts fear that the situation may have to get much worse before it gets better.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmklk0u0500013b6su7fizaud@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s particularly devastating, they say, because the illnesses and deaths they foresee are almost entirely preventable with the help of vaccines — but &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/14/health/vaccine-exemptions-county-risk-measles-vis"&gt;lagging coverage&lt;/a&gt; has left many vulnerable.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f00083b6ptxalh4rr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not clear yet whether the US will maintain its measles elimination status. In April, the Pan American Health Organization, part of the World Health Organization, will formally make the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/canada-measles-elimination-status-removed"&gt;determination&lt;/a&gt;. The decision will require detailed review of epidemiological and laboratory evidence to understand patterns of measles spread over the past year — including whether more recent outbreaks are linked to the Texas outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f00093b6p7h6jwvnp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But experts say that formally losing measles elimination status would be a symptom of more deeply rooted issues, particularly challenges with vaccination that have been building for many years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000a3b6pdd3p39mp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Let’s face it, whether we lose elimination status or not in spring, is our public health system actually doing well?” said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, who resigned in protest last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000b3b6pzhoqg2r4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Measles elimination is a vital sign of our public health system. That public health system is blue in the ICU,” he said. “I don’t need to check its pulse to know [it’s not doing well]. I know the answer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000c3b6pu6zooffj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/31/health/vaccination-school-requirements-cdc"&gt;record share&lt;/a&gt; of US kindergartners had an exemption for a required vaccination last school year, according to data from the CDC, marking the fifth year in a row that coverage with the MMR vaccine was been below the federal target of 95%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmklwh4q900003b6s3bxua13a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC says that the increase in vaccine exemptions may be “due to an increase in vaccine hesitancy.” A recent &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/pubs-resources/parental-attitudes-toward-vaccination-requirements.html" target="_blank"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; of parents conducted by the agency found that most supported vaccine requirements to attend school. But among those seeking an exemption, the most commonly reported reason – cited more than a third of the time – was a philosophical or personal belief objection to vaccination. Difficulty meeting school requirements by the deadline was also reported as a reason for exemption by about 23% of parents. Medical reasons were cited by more than a quarter of parents, but the CDC said that might include parents who consider concerns about vaccine safety or side effects as a “medical” reason to request an exemption.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000d3b6ph96jf0tr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Vaccines are a victim of their own success. It’s not just that we eliminated measles. I think we eliminated the memory of measles,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000e3b6pvk9mmrj1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Offit remembers speaking with&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC557162/" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Maurice Hilleman&lt;/a&gt;, a microbiologist who developed the MMR vaccine and dozens of others, just months before Hilleman’s death in 2005. Measles cases had reached a record low in 2004 but were starting to trend up again, just a few years after the US had achieved elimination following a long and hard-fought battle.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000f3b6p2rdjhwku@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I asked him, ‘Do you think that we can educate people about the importance of the vaccine, about the serious nature of this disease, or does the virus have to come back?” Offit said. He said there was a tear in his eye when he replied that virus was going to have to come back to teach that lesson.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000g3b6p6ebs73pf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That was an enormous defeat for him,” Offit said. “It’s an enormous defeat for us to once again see children be exposed to something that could kill them — and did kill them – in this country, when that was completely unnecessary.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000h3b6pd2rpeowp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But it seems more and more that the virus isn’t necessarily doing that educating either, Offit said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000i3b6pytcripbb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There were three deaths from measles last year — as many as there had been over the past 25 years combined — yet it’s been a struggle to increase vaccination rates, even in communities that experienced outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000j3b6pha5k9q6u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The South Carolina health department has offered a mobile vaccination clinic since the early weeks of the outbreak in the upstate region of the state, but state epidemiologist Dr. Linda Bell has said that uptake has been “disappointing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000k3b6pb555xjf2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles outbreaks tend to occur in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/14/health/vaccine-exemptions-county-risk-measles-vis"&gt;under vaccinated pockets&lt;/a&gt; of the US, often in tight-knit communities, such as those with certain religious beliefs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000l3b6p4eyp37nw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Daskalakis says that there’s a new type of tight-knit community in the US – one that’s less geographically connected, but created and held together by the spread of anti-vaccine messaging, including by US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and others at the extremes of the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/16/politics/rfk-vaccines-covid-maha-cassidy-explainer"&gt;MAHA movement&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000m3b6pdxgtetxu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The mission since the dawn of the vaccination program in America is that if we can prevent a disease with a vaccine that has an extremely favorable risk-to-benefit profile, that we do it,” Daskalakis said. “It seems as if the value of that strategy has been minimized for some populations. Not for everybody, but enough where I expect that measles is going to be a part of our future, at least in the medium-, if not long-term.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmklo8k24000d3b6pazd5mo7b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS says that Kennedy has been “clear and consistent” in his messaging that vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent measles, but the agency also says that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/02/health/measles-rfk-vaccines"&gt;individuals should consult with their health care provider&lt;/a&gt; about what is best for them and their family.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkltbwue00003b6sj3aaqcvh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS recently made sweeping changes to the childhood vaccine schedule, now recommending fewer vaccines for most American children in a move Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2026/2026-cdc-acts-on-presidential-memorandum-to-update-childhood-immunization-schedule.html" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; “protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health.” MMR vaccine recommendations were not changed, but experts worry it could contribute to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/05/health/childhood-vaccine-schedule-overhaul"&gt;broader doubts about vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000n3b6p0byetz29@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s unclear what will change individual minds about vaccination, experts say — perhaps a recalibration of public health messaging and more families fearing measles reaching their doorstep — but the risk for increasingly large outbreaks mean there will be many preventable illnesses and deaths ahead.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000o3b6pjoiltlou@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have already been more than 550 measles cases in the South Carolina outbreak, and at least one out of every 1,000 people with measles may die.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmklkk5au00003b6ph4mwsxpp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a matter of numbers. The more cases there are, the more opportunities there are for severe illness,” said Rivers, whose organization developed a &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/resources/us-measles-tracker" target="_blank"&gt;measles case tracker&lt;/a&gt; and worked with health departments from across the country to help them learn from their experiences responding to measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000p3b6pne8cr3ac@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Raising vaccination rates is the best way to keep cases to a minimum and prevent those tragic outcomes, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000q3b6pvl8ubq7v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That could happen in a matter of months, Rivers said. It’s how other large outbreaks have been &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/10/health/measles-outbreak-new-york-2019-lessons-learned"&gt;brought to a halt&lt;/a&gt;. But the potential for change may depend on whether people are perceiving these outbreaks as threats to their own lives, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000r3b6p46oonp2j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “With sufficient attention, motivation and policy changes like strengthening school entry requirements, we can get those coverage levels up very quickly,” she said. “We have all the pieces in place. We just need families to understand how important it is, and that piece could take years.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000s3b6pj46i7ide@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The increase in the frequency and size of measles outbreaks will certainly put additional strain on public health, Daskalakis says. Continuing to build relationships and lean on trusted partners within local communities can help reinforce critical messaging about the importance of vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkljko1f000t3b6p53r8uc7p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, optimism persists.

            “This is what public health does,” Daskalakis said. “Public health is never static. There’s always a new challenge, there’s always new misinformation and, frankly, also new information that moves you in a different direction.”

But type “parasite cleanse” into TikTok or Instagram and you’ll be inundated with so-called experts peddling expensive herbal supplements that promise to detox the body and rid it of harmful worms and parasites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One TikTok user, whose credentials are “holistic mama”, suggests people should do deworming cleanses if they experience “sleep issues, gut issues, weight loss issues, mood swings, skin issues”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It would be nearly impossible to find a single human not dealing with at least one of these issues. Does that mean everyone should be on a parasite cleanse?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“NO,” Caroline Susie, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics wrote in all caps over email. She emphasized that there was no solid clinical evidence behind them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ideally, all-caps discouragement from a medical professional would be enough reason to steer clear of something. But if you’re still unconvinced, here’s what to know about parasite cleanses, and why you probably don’t need to do one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-parasites" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are parasites?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Parasites are organisms that live in, on or with another organism and get their food “from or at the expense of its host”, per the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/about/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. For example: tapeworms, fleas or me when I lived at my parents’ house after college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Humans contract parasites in several ways, says Beth Czerwony, outpatient dietitian for Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Human Nutrition. These include ingestion of contaminated food or water and direct contact with infected feces, she explains. Some parasites, like hookworm, can also penetrate the skin when a person walks barefoot on contaminated soil, and others can be transmitted person to person in unhygienic environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the US and UK, the most common intestinal parasites are giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis, says Dr William A Petri, professor of infectious diseases at the University of Virginia. Both are transmitted through the ingestion of fecally contaminated food or water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Parasitic infections are extremely common. According to a 2023 World Health Organization (WHO) &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/soil-transmitted-helminth-infections" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, almost 25% of the global population has an infection related to parasitic worms like roundworms, whipworms and hookworms. These infections tend to be concentrated in “the poorest and most deprived communities” where people lack access to clean water and sanitation, per the WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Having intestinal parasites is less common in places with good sanitation,” says Czerwony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-symptoms-of-a-parasitic-infection" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the symptoms of a parasitic infection?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Symptoms vary based on the type of parasite and the health of the host, says Czerwony. Often, symptoms include conditions like diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting, stomach pain, loss of appetite or increase in hunger, unexplained weight loss, skin irritation, visible worms or eggs in one’s stool, and itching around the anus or genitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-a-parasite-cleanse" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a ‘parasite cleanse’?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Klum said of her own cleanse that it had “all these herbs”. Most of those so-called remedies peddled on social media &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/parasite-cleanse" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;involve&lt;/a&gt; taking herbal supplements (like anise, clove, grapeseed, wormwood and goldenseal), dietary changes (like eliminating processed foods or cutting out gluten) or some combination of the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="does-it-work" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does it work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“There is no evidence that these parasite cleanses are either effective or needed,” says Petri. And if someone feels better after one of these cleanses, it’s probably not the result of parasites, says Susie – it might simply be that they’re eating more nutrient-dense food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At-home cleanses are also not without risks. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2026/jan/08/supplements-vitamins-safety-dosage-limit-guide" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Supplements are not regulated&lt;/a&gt;, Susie notes. Additionally, she says, some herbs can interact with other medications and be toxic at high doses. Restrictive diets can also lead to nutrient deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-do-you-treat-a-parasitic-infection" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you treat a parasitic infection?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If you think you may have a parasite, it is important to contact a medical professional and not treat it yourself,” says Czerwony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Infections can be diagnosed with stool samples or blood tests and, in some cases, with imaging tests like endoscopies or colonoscopies, she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If a patient does have a parasitic infection, treatment depends on the type of parasite and the severity of the infection. Often, doctors will prescribe antiparasitic or antibiotic medications, and/or rehydration and nutrition support if severe weight loss has occurred, Czerwony says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="did-the-parasite-cleanse-work-for-heidi-klum" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did the parasite cleanse work for Heidi Klum?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure id="fc789204-afae-4504-9260-710036d6f7fa" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Heidi Klum’s worm costume.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Stephen Lovekin/Rex/Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Unclear, but probably not.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkhegg2y00gnzskwiwzo9dtm@published"&gt;Let’s get this out of the way first: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is not going to be successful at his stated MAHA goal. You can’t make America healthier—I refuse to even say “again” when &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2013/09/life-expectancy-history-public-health-and-medical-advances-that-lead-to-long-lives.html"&gt;we weren’t healthy before&lt;/a&gt;—while you are simultaneously so &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/house-democrats-slam-rfk-jr-research-funding-cuts-vaccine-policy"&gt;drastically slashing&lt;/a&gt; budgets for scientific research. You also can’t make America healthier while ignoring any expert who is not a crackpot—and so very much data—on &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/im-a-physician-who-has-looked-at-hundreds-of-studies-of-vaccine-safety-and-heres-some-of-what-rfk-jr-gets-wrong-259659"&gt;the basics of vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. More minimally, you can’t make America healthier while claiming that, say, seed oils are the devil (&lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/01/sweetgreen-menu-salad-nutrition-seed-oil.html"&gt;seed oils are innocent&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkheh3px000o357bj3dyz1q3@published"&gt;So the question isn’t whether RFK Jr. will make America healthier. On balance, he will only be a disaster for American health. (Sure, he will occasionally get things right—this fact brings to mind the saying about &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/a_stopped_clock_is_right_twice_a_day"&gt;broken clocks&lt;/a&gt;, and the one &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem"&gt;about a monkey at a typewriter and &lt;em&gt;Hamlet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) But what will he actually do?&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkheh3sm000p357bigw43aqz@published"&gt;Well, to be sure, he will make life worse—&lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/08/rfk-jr-vaccines-mrna-dangerous-diseases-deaths.html"&gt;and shorter&lt;/a&gt;—for &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/30/rfk-jr-hhs-job-cuts-minority-health-offices.html"&gt;lots of groups of people&lt;/a&gt;. But as a person who recently gave birth to a baby and spent months watching and reading the news from maternity leave, my answer to that question is: RFK Jr. is waging a war on women.&lt;/p&gt;

    


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkheh3w0000q357blqahgqf8@published"&gt;Let’s go through some of the ways. Kennedy is encouraging women to breastfeed, to provide their babies with, &lt;a href="https://www.c-span.org/clip/news-conference/user-clip-rfk-jr-on-breastfeeding-and-infant-formula/5183687"&gt;as he puts it&lt;/a&gt;, “the infant formula that God made, the infant formula in a mother’s breast.” (Would that not be the infant formula that the &lt;em&gt;woman&lt;/em&gt; made, with her own body? I digress.) While increasing breastfeeding rates is a goal shared by many legitimate public health experts (see: broken clock), the biological advantages of breastfeeding are &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/20/is-breast-really-best-i-looked-at-all-the-data-to-find-out"&gt;somewhat limited&lt;/a&gt;, making this a strange enterprise for a government official. But more to the point, the costs of breastfeeding, particularly exclusively breastfeeding with no supplement from formula, are huge. For women.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="129" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkheh3z0000r357bpln4o8pa@published"&gt;Namely, breastfeeding is very time-consuming, even in the best of circumstances. (In the worst, it can involve women working on the project of feeding their infant at &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/10/traded-sanity-for-milk-breastfed-despite-the-pain"&gt;great expense to their own well-being&lt;/a&gt;.) Formula—real, store-bought formula—is, except in &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/response-broader-fda-investigation-byheart-initiates-voluntary-recall-two-batches-infant-formula"&gt;freak cases&lt;/a&gt; of contamination, a perfectly safe and good option for getting babies fed, right now. Nonetheless, Kennedy has, along with his weird breastfeeding comments, simultaneously &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHd6XoDvp9O/"&gt;widely publicized&lt;/a&gt; a project “to make sure infant formula products are safe and wholesome.” What Kennedy really stands to do here is scare women away from a method of nourishing their babies that is perfectly acceptable, that is healthy, and that stands to make life easier—and in some cases, simply livable—for us by introducing his classic fearmongering tactics to matters that have already been settled.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="215" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkheh41x000s357buj4x7i2n@published"&gt;Then there’s the Tylenol fiasco. Kennedy has called on women to restrict the use of Tylenol during pregnancy to cases where it is “absolutely necessary.” For the unaware, Tylenol is somewhat notoriously a medicine that is deemed safe during pregnancy—the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/09/acog-affirms-safety-benefits-acetaminophen-pregnancy"&gt;released a statement&lt;/a&gt; saying that Tylenol is “one of the few options available to pregnant patients to treat pain and fever.” There are all kinds of very sensible recommendations against taking certain substances during pregnancy, if at all possible, and Tylenol is not one of them. So where is Kennedy getting this? It’s another fear campaign. The evidence regarding Tylenol use while with child, &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5582061-kennedy-trump-tylenol-autism/"&gt;he notes&lt;/a&gt;, “is not sufficient to say it definitely caused autism, but it is very suggestive.” These comments came on the heels of Donald Trump’s even stronger warning: “Don’t take Tylenol. Don’t take it. Fight like hell not to take it.” Science, of course, always &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; find a link &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2026/01/microplastics-brain-research-not-bad.html"&gt;between any given thing and anything else&lt;/a&gt;, but it is telling that the studies done so far on Tylenol and autism &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/22/health/kennedy-autism-tylenol-trump.html"&gt;have, taken together, not found anything conclusive&lt;/a&gt;. And still, Kennedy is &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5518478-tylenol-acetaminophen-pregnancy-risks/"&gt;trying&lt;/a&gt; to knock the bottle from our hands during what is, for some women, one of the most physically unpleasant times of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkheh44o000t357b7yrk0xj3@published"&gt;The war on women shows up less obviously, but perhaps with even more wide-reaching consequences, in other RFK Jr. projects. Take his stance on vaccines. He recently oversaw the removal of several from the recommended childhood immunization schedule. Who, by and large in America, will be taking care of the kids who have to stay home from school when they get sick? Who will take them to the emergency room? Who will &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/AmerAcadPeds/posts/an-infant-born-prematurely-and-infected-with-measles-has-died-in-canada-the-infa/1132893888872170/"&gt;bear the blame&lt;/a&gt; when what happens is even worse than an ER visit? Disproportionately, women.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkheh473000u357b0mtcy6tg@published"&gt;Then take his stance against ultraprocessed foods, which he has &lt;a href="https://time.com/7211678/rfk-jr-ultra-processed-foods-ban/"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; a “mass poison”—and the fact that in his new food guidance, he advises that children should avoid sugar through age 10. Who will be ensuring that a Lunchable never so much as touches a child’s lips? (Lunchables: They are not healthy, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2024/04/lead-lunchables-consumer-reports-california-regulations-unhealthy.html"&gt;but they are safe&lt;/a&gt;!) Who will be convincing 9-year-olds to forgo birthday cake, or figuring out what to present as a birthday treat if it is not cake? Probably the group of people who mostly take care of children: women.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkheh49u000v357b0ebhj9vo@published"&gt;For the record, ultraprocessed foods are not even inherently bad. The fact is that they are a tool (like formula, like Tylenol) that can make life easier, more manageable, and even—by extension—&lt;a href="https://slate.com/life/2025/01/ultraprocessed-foods-healthy-energy-fear-trader-joes.html"&gt;literally healthier&lt;/a&gt;. These tools also allow women tasked with gestating children, caring for infants, and doing housework to not be completely consumed by it. Consider: Who even has time to prepare food entirely from scratch? To breastfeed exclusively? To lie there pregnant and in pain, just for the sake of it? A woman who does not work outside the home.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="152" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkheh4d9000w357bogvkdvev@published"&gt;Yes, women could always&lt;em&gt; just not &lt;/em&gt;follow Kennedy’s advice. Just use formula. Just take Tylenol! Just make &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2017/07/dont-panic-over-the-chemicals-in-your-mac-and-cheese.html"&gt;the mac and cheese&lt;/a&gt; for dinner. Just vaccinate your children. I am personally &lt;a href="https://slate.com/culture/2020/09/anne-helen-petersen-burnout-book-reviewed.html"&gt;a huge fan of &lt;em&gt;just exercising your own agency&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But there are two issues here: One is the incredible swirl of half-realized health information that women &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; have to navigate, both when it comes to finding answers through official channels (doctors, often, simply have no answer for &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/08/pain-sex-vestibulodynia-physical-therapy-hormones.html"&gt;even basic inquiries into our pain&lt;/a&gt;) and when it comes to logging onto any social media site for any reason. There are just so many autoplaying videos of influencers out there issuing dire warnings about one thing or another that we already have to navigate, even though most of it has to do with the danger of not buying this or that gadget, or course, or coaching session that they so happen to be selling.&lt;/p&gt;

He helps decide who staffs agencies, what gets funded, which direction the country points in when it comes to research. He has overseen cuts to offices in the Department of Health and Human Services that &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/30/rfk-jr-hhs-job-cuts-minority-health-offices.html"&gt;work to improve minority health&lt;/a&gt;. He has done a “&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/rfk-jr-hhs-moves-to-restore-public-trust-in-vaccines-45495112"&gt;clean sweep&lt;/a&gt;” of the panel that advises the Centers for Disease Control on vaccines in order to appoint his own people. He has, in his first year at HHS, “significantly thinned out the sprawling $1.7 trillion department,” &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-jr-kennedy-trump-health-hhs-maha-5e1e9e3208c42b6a185facad26e3b457"&gt;as an evenhanded report from the Associated Press put it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="61" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkheh4ja000y357bjj8bf0t8@published"&gt;When it comes to women’s health specifically, he may not have (yet) shown the specific laser-focus in cutting that he has in other areas. But he has already shown a willingness &lt;a href="https://www.whi.org/md/news/whi-funding-announcement"&gt;to snatch away and dangle&lt;/a&gt; funding for research into women’s health. Last spring in a typically-chaotic MAGA move, he cut—then, following public outcry, restored—support for &lt;a href="https://www.ajmc.com/view/hhs-cuts-funding-for-nih-based-women-s-health-initiative-threatening-decades-long-study"&gt;the sprawling Women’s Health Initiative&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="139" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkheh4lx000z357bkc5eqrm4@published"&gt;Consider Kennedy, then, a health influencer who has not just access to a national podium, but also a say in what happens with a hulking budget. We might be able to individually ignore his advice, even as it becomes a more and more tiring process to sort out what is true and what is not, as iterations of Kennedy’s views are repeated everywhere from the social media accounts of other influencers to the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/20/nx-s1-5615040/cdc-rfk-childhood-vaccines-autism"&gt;own website&lt;/a&gt;. But we will, as the consequences of his agenda come to bear on who is hired by the government and what work they are able to do, increasingly simply be living in Kennedy’s world. The lesson for this second year of his tenure is clear: However exhausting it is, we have to pay attention. Pop a Tylenol and get ready to fight &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Golden Retriever pairs always look cute together, but this brother and sister duo took it to another level. This Golden Retriever video with two siblings feels like watching twins. In this wholesome video on Instagram, Cooper and Freya sit side by side and copy each other. Every little move matches, from tiny tongue flicks to the same stare. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-golden-retriever-siblings-in-sync-surprise-wows-online-users"&gt;Golden Retriever siblings’ in-sync surprise wows online users&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Posted by &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTkzw_KD293/?igsh=ZDVhenczYTB5eDNq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;@cooperxfreya.retriever&lt;/a&gt;, the short reel shows Cooper, an older Golden Retriever, and Freya, his younger sister. They pose in a doorway at home while the on-screen text reads, “like brother, like sister.” The two pups sit tall on the threshold, almost like they are waiting for a cue. First, their heads tilt at the same time. Then they both glance off to the side in sync. Even their little tongue pops happen together.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The synchronized moment happens right at the front door, with Cooper and Freya framed by the open entryway. In the clip, the older dog stays calm and steady, while the pup mirrors him with serious focus. They both lick their noses within seconds of each other. A second later, they lift their chins and look up, as if looking at the same thing. In another beat, they yawn at the same time, which is what made viewers laugh hardest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cooper’s fluffy coat and big, relaxed posture make him look like the confident big brother. Freya keeps her paws tucked neatly and follows along like a tiny shadow. Together, they create a perfect “copy and paste” routine without trying too hard. It is the kind of sibling bond that feels natural, not trained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reactions were warm and amused. One commenter wrote, “Synced sucessful.” Another said, “No DNA test needed?.” A third added, “Omggg down to the yawn too ?.” Others chimed in too, with one writing, “So cute my bro and sis❤️,” while another simply added, “Awh so cute!” By the end, the &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; siblings video leaves one clear takeaway. Some dogs just move together like they share one brain.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="8d56c591-083e-45d7-a261-a9daa8c5ef77"&gt;Can’t sleep? Or do you find yourself constantly waking up at night? The answer to getting a good night’s sleep could actually be linked to what’s going on in your digestive system. Gut health and sleep are bedfellows—and if you can improve one, the other will follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s because gut microbes don’t just digest the food we eat, explains Dr Manal Mohammed, a senior lecturer in Medical Microbiology at the University of Westminster in London: “A healthy gut microbiome supports better sleep by producing sleep-regulating neurotransmitters like serotonin and melatonin, reducing inflammation and modulating stress hormones,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="8d56c591-083e-45d7-a261-a9daa8c5ef77-2"&gt;“When the gut is happy, this also promotes the production of calming chemicals in the body like GABA, and helps maintain circadian rhythms [the body’s internal clock]. Together, these effects contribute to deeper, more restorative and consistent sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how can you improve your gut health? Mohammed has a five-step guide. Here’s what she recommends to ultimately help you towards a better night’s sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-keep-consistent-meal-times" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-keep-consistent-meal-times"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Keep consistent meal times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="b182ba1f-cb5a-4404-87ef-0c855a912aeb"&gt;Like the body’s circadian rhythm, the digestive system has its own internal clock that helps the gut maintain a steady daily flow. Studies have found that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40488812/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40488812/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;erratic meal-times&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/nutrition/eating-too-late-could-wreck-your-sleep-muscle-recovery-and-impact-weight-gain-why-this-expert-recommends-an-early-dinner" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/nutrition/eating-too-late-could-wreck-your-sleep-muscle-recovery-and-impact-weight-gain-why-this-expert-recommends-an-early-dinner"&gt;eating too close to bedtime&lt;/a&gt; plays havoc with microbes because it interferes with nutrient absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Mohammed explains that “predictable eating patterns reduce inflammation, stabilize blood sugar and enhance the production of SCFAs [&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9498509/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9498509/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;short-chain fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;], which are important for strengthening the gut lining and supporting the gut-brain axis. Overall, regular meal timing helps maintain a balanced, diverse and healthy gut microbiome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2-eat-foods-rich-in-prebiotics-and-probiotics" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-eat-foods-rich-in-prebiotics-and-probiotics"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Eat foods rich in prebiotics and probiotics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="b11e42cd-7113-4d39-9586-a2a7d263ccef"&gt;Prebiotics are widely available in fiber-rich foods, while probiotics can be found in some fermented foods, or for larger quantities through supplementation. The two work together to keep the gut happy and this can have the knock on effect of better sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-4iNbA9mpegH8HAi3PBoSMR" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-4iNbA9mpegH8HAi3PBoSMR slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Probiotics provide beneficial live bacteria for the gut: found in foods such as kefir, kimchi, sauerkraut and miso,” Mohammed tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well.&lt;/em&gt; “Prebiotics, on the other hand, are non-digestible fibers that serve as food for these beneficial bacteria and they are found in foods like garlic, onions, leeks, bananas, oats, asparagus and chicory root.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Probiotics help introduce and support healthy gut microbes, while prebiotics help them survive, grow and thrive. They support a healthy gut microbiome by working together to promote beneficial bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This synergy enhances microbial diversity and boosts SCFA production such as butyrate, which strengthens the gut barrier and supports digestion, immunity and gut–brain communication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-3-cut-back-on-sugar-and-ultra-processed-foods-upfs" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-cut-back-on-sugar-and-ultra-processed-foods-upfs"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Cut back on sugar and ultra-processed foods (UPFs) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="865f111b-5fb9-475b-b3e0-45692561772f"&gt;Sugary and UPFs—such as sodas, cereals and ready meals—are highly inflammatory, they irritate and weaken the gut lining by reducing microbial diversity and spiking blood sugar levels. UPFs are often low in fiber and high in additives, like emulsifiers and artificial sweeteners, which suppress fiber-fermenting bacteria—negatively impacting gut health, and therefore sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mohammed explains that when you cut back on these nutrient-deficient foods it “allows beneficial microbes such as &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; to thrive, while stabilizing blood sugar and inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She recommends swapping sugary products and UPFs for whole foods, including vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds. “This will increase the amount of prebiotic fiber in the body, boosting the production of SCFAs to strengthen the gut barrier, regulate immune function, support gut–brain communication and reduce inflammation—creating an environment where a healthy and diverse gut microbiome can flourish,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-4-try-to-reduce-stress" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-4-try-to-reduce-stress"&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. Try to reduce stress &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="58aeec68-eb4a-40cc-93d9-4bc396fb8334"&gt;This one might be easier said than done, but stress levels can really play havoc with the gut and sleep. Stress floods the body with the hormone cortisol, leading to an increase in inflammation in the body and a weaker gut lining. When you are less stressed, your digestion can work more efficiently and this helps to maintain a “balanced and resilient gut ecosystem”, says Mohammed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing stress levels can be tricky but breathwork and exercise can help, as can taking time away from social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-5-stay-well-hydrated" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-5-stay-well-hydrated"&gt;&lt;span&gt;5. Stay well hydrated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="b06cd1bc-0f95-4a94-aaaa-11af4c1da4b6"&gt;There are so many ways in which drinking a healthy amount of water is beneficial for your gut. Water supports the breakdown of food, absorption of nutrients and helps lubricate the digestive tract to help with the removal of waste—promoting regular bowel movements. It also supports a healthy gut microbiome and immune function. A happy, more stable gut environment means you are more likely to have a deeper and restorative sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

My go-to remedy is usually a coffee and cold-water face plunge, followed by a compulsive phone scroll. But today called for something more, so I unpeeled a small, yellow “energy” patch the size of a walnut, popped it on to my upper arm and hoped for the best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The patch (£12 for 30) contains – so the packaging says – vitamins B5, B3 and a “microdose” of caffeine. It is made by Kind Patches, which is one brand in an increasingly crowded market of wellness stickers that claim to treat everything from lack of sleep to period pains to pimples. They are coin-sized, and often come in TikTok-friendly shades of sunflower yellow and peachy orange: you may have seen a teenager sporting a star-shaped one on their face to treat spots, or influencers patting blue magnesium ones on their wrists before bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;These patches are designed to deliver various substances into the bloodstream through the skin – to ward off some of the most common symptoms of everyday life. Feeling tired? Patches. Feeling stressed? Patches. Feeling anxious? Patches. From libido boosters to immunity enhancers, there’s a patch for every condition if you look hard enough. The wearable patch market – which also includes disease monitoring and drug delivery – was estimated at &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5ebdee6d-eee0-4ed9-a7e2-7547bd1f03c9" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$9.95bn in 2024&lt;/a&gt; (approx £7.45bn) and is predicted to grow significantly in the next five years, according to the Financial Times. Forget eating your feelings; pop a sticker on them instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="89c65e0d-f726-4cb8-ad45-cf40b21e432f" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Star patches for acne and pimples are the accessory of choice for gen Z.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Karen Stanley/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But do they work?

It is: do you feel better?” For example, the energy patch I’m wearing now may make me feel better. “But my take on energy might be different to yours,” Tregoning points out. If nothing else, he says, patches like the ones I am sampling “are an example of drifting placebo. Simply by putting it on, it might get you out of a slump”. It’s also nigh-on impossible to prove which ones don’t work if you can’t prove which ones do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;You cannot feel these patches , and they slide off easily in the bath. But you can certainly see them, which for some users is half the point. Depending on where you place the patch – guidance varies, but most suggest the neck and chest areas to see which makes a difference – they are often as visible as you need them to be. Some claim to work the same day, while others suggest using them for up to a month. The effects of the energy patch I am wearing are supposed to be instant. I can’t say I feel anything that morning, but by the time I peel it off in the bath, I do believe I feel fresher. The idea is neat. But is it the patch? I also did some yoga, and had steak for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I try another energy patch by The What Supp Co (£18 for 15 patches), which it says is for “fatigue, fed-up feelings and focus”. It contains ashwagandha (which it &lt;a href="https://thewhatsupp.com/products/protect-your-energy-vitamin-patches" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; “helps your body adapt to stress”) and caffeine among a list of other ingredients. I pop the red W-shaped patch on my wrist, as shown in the instruction video. I don’t know if it is doing anything, but I do struggle to get to sleep that night, which is debatably down to the caffeine (luckily I have a patch for sleep too).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Acupuncturist Ross J Barr also makes a &lt;a href="https://www.rossbarr.com/collections/patch/products/focus-patches?variant=55856746627452" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt; that promises to support “focus, clarity and mental performance” (£15 for 10). Less visible than most, it smells herbal, a little festive, which is the point – it apparently offers a “deeply relaxing olfactive experience”&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;I could also feel it when I put the patch on – a gentle tingling, not unlike a Tens machine, which did at least make me believe it was doing something. I also try Barr’s &lt;a href="https://www.rossbarr.com/collections/patch/products/period-patches?variant=44601291374756" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Period Patches&lt;/a&gt; for cramps, aches and pains (£15 for seven), which were developed with gynaecological staff at Miss Claire Mellon &amp;amp; Associates private practice. Like Barr’s other patch, it smells strongly of essential oils – somewhere between a meadow and tobacco – which is also the point. The sticker is stickier, and even after six hours it’s hard to remove. It is also designed to fit very specifically at the base of the spine. I don’t know how much this played into what happened next – but something did. My cramps seemed to mellow. Whether this was better than taking a painkiller, I couldn’t say. But the patches certainly cost more than over-the-counter painkillers – a factor that Dr Deborah Cohen, author of the new book Bad Influence: How the Internet Hijacked Our Health, thinks might influence how well they work. “The more expensive something is, the more you expect it to work,” she says. Cohen thinks women’s health has been neglected for too long, but&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;these patches expose broader problems in the healthcare system too. “One of the reasons we go to social media to solve our problems is because doctors can’t give that level of holistic care,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="60e35233-9643-491c-b91b-78c873e8cea5" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Ross J Barr Focus Patches.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Ross J Barr&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Eleven days into my patch journey, I have tried one for sleep and one for dreaming (Ross J Barr, £14.99 for 10, and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Kind, £12 for 30); two for focus (Kind, £12 for 30, and Ross J Barr, £15 for 10), one for energy (Kind, £12 for 30), one for chilling out (The What Supp Co, £18 for 15), and another for menstrual cramps (Ross J Barr, £14.99 for seven). I’d love to say their collective effect was seismic, but aside from feeling a little buzzy after wearing those containing caffeine and the aforementioned effects of Barr’s cramp patches, I can’t be sure that I felt &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That’s not to say they didn’t work. The science behind patches is at best nebulous and at worse absent, but as you can’t control the variables, it’s impossible to know if it’s the patch – or something else. “Reducing something to, say, one hormone is a very reductionist way of looking at our health,” says Cohen. “We need to be more holistic and look at the whole person before we work out how to treat something.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Inevitably some of these patches have taken a more sinister turn towards diet culture. Berberine, a plant-derived compound, is believed to suppress appetite. I try Kind’s berberine patches (which curiously changed their name from Weightless); they need to be worn every day to see a difference. When I go out for a walk, I have to turn back as I start feeling light-headed. I quickly take it off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Ultimately, if patches are as good as they say they are, why isn’t everything on one?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I’m struck that only one of the patches I try comes with the caveat that they are not the only solution to a problem. Alongside using Barr’s sleep patches, for example, it is recommended that other basic sleep hygiene practices are brought in – read a book, turn off your phone, etc. While there may not be anything specifically wrong with putting on a patch if you can afford it, they are not a panacea. As Tregoning points out, it’s probably best to see them “like an expensive herbal tea”. Drink it if you like it and think it helps, but it’s not a cure-all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But then this is the problem with a lot of the products in the wellness space – everyone is looking for a hack, a quick fix. It is easier to put a sleep patch on than contemplate that poor sleep may be a logical response to the modern world; that a lack of energy may be due to an overwhelming life; that a lack of focus may mean you are dealing with bigger problems than the day-to-day of going to work. In an age in which we have learned to manipulate the aesthetics of our bodies through surgery or fillers, it seems highly appropriate that we might also now wear our supplements. As Cohen writes in her book, “the body is now a dashboard to be monitored and gamified”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="ec98b8d3-2cd1-4d0d-8d35-87523ca15e67" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Karen Stanley/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And of course, this is performative health. When I failed to give up smoking, my nicotine patch was proof to the outside world that I was at least trying. Lisa Payne, head of beauty at trend forecaster company Stylus, calls it&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“handbag health” – the idea that you can carry around patches and pop them on when you need a lift. “These patches cost money, so it literally shows you have invested in your health.” Forget eating your feelings; pop a plaster on them instead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 The use of patches in medicine is nothing new, says Pupinder Ghatora, a pharmacist and co-founder of a collagen supplement brand. “In pharmaceuticals, we’ve used patches for pain relief, anti-sickness medications, certain heart treatments and nicotine-replacement therapy. These medicines are clinically proven as the molecule is suitable for skin absorption and the formulation is designed with this in mind.” However, the evidence on wellness patches for other purposes is less clear. “Transdermal delivery can absolutely be effective but only when the science supports it. The skin barrier is incredibly sophisticated and not every ingredient can pass through it,” Ghatora says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The problem, adds Cohen, isn’t just the way these substances are delivered – it’s the substances themselves. “Before you get to the ‘route’, the first thing to ask is whether the compound they’re promoting is going to do anything.” Take something like dopamine, she says, for which patches do exist. This needs to go into your brain to work. How does that even happen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“HRT patches and nicotine patches [which have been around for a while] require robust clinical trials to prove they have an effect. But if you can spin something into a wellness supplement, you don’t need regulators,” she says. “Ultimately, if patches are as good as they say they are, why isn’t everything on one?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Perhaps the most ubiquitous patches are Star patches. If you have a teenager – or watched last year’s Big Brother – there is every chance you’ve come across them. Designed to protect spots from bacteria and prevent picking, while also containing various ingredients which may or may not treat the spot, they have become such a mainstay of modern culture that the V&amp;amp;A recently acquired some in its &lt;a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/rapid-response-collecting?srsltid=AfmBOoqFisrHBGVBj0Q5Zwa6ZkuqzU81v9_Y_vLnMhq1-Dt0TWJ0UKHl" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Rapid Response Collecting&lt;/a&gt; as an example of gen Z lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="b04ec8d4-65f9-4d3f-aef7-ea12d840ae31" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Kind’s Berberine metabolic balance patch.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Kind Patches&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Advertising that you have a pimple is a million miles away from how millennials like me and Payne grew up. “Our generation saw beauty as something that solves the problem you want to fix,” she says. If you had a spot, you’d buy concealer to hide it, not a neon sticker to broadcast it as a shared experience. But for some of gen Z, Payne says, a visible treatment for an internal feeling is as much about identity as anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It used to be easy to be good. All you had to do was combine a decent diet, exercise, time outside and connection with friends. Now, says Cohen, “daily life is subjected to medical interpretation and diagnosis, with normal variations reframed as conditions requiring intervention”. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 I spent three weeks patched up, on and off. And some people I know swear by Barr’s sleep patches. But it was also deep, dark December, a time when my moods and sleep shift like sand, and as a newish millennial parent, it was ever thus. Patches are an example of the way influencer culture has scrambled how we look at ourselves. But if you’re tired and there’s no other underlying problem causing it, the likelihood is you probably need to rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxQZ0QzX0RELUZCc2lrOW8zMVp6R0k2S1NJRG1uaVJnbVUtanQ4X1pPdWp1TWFCOUZ3clJOUTRSbE55RzNxUFFMRERQOWZQb1FPSHRac3F0SzNpTzNLZkZSLUpRbHpKV2xPdDJ1ZnNEaDVZa0FmaTRHMGdDUmc2ZzRwajZydWllaHdfOFV5RkpmRHdQcXlVNG5SX1g5aTVkd3pDMXhQUklZWkU3aWY3NGZBRlpLaVlJM2l5X2NmQm9YdVo</guid></item><item><title>医生说， “每天只需几分钟”就可以改善平衡并降低跌倒的风险- Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/bodyweight-exercises/a-doctor-says-all-it-takes-is-a-few-intentional-minutes-a-day-to-improve-balance-and-reduce-your-risk-of-falls</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;

It doesn’t. A few intentional minutes a day can really help to improve confidence, reduce fall risk and strengthen muscles.

			&lt;p&gt;Reduced blood flow to the brain is thought to be a key factor in many forms of dementia, including  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="187972" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, and scientists have just identified a new mechanism regulating this flow, which may also help explain how it goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fat molecule helps maintain the system's balance, researchers at the University of Vermont discovered, and in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, disruption of this balance led to problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixing the imbalance restored more normal blood flow, offering a hopeful new target for understanding and treating dementia-related brain changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This discovery is a huge step forward in our efforts to prevent dementia and neurovascular diseases," &lt;a href="https://www.uvm.edu/larnermed/medcommunications/news/r1-larner-spotlight-new-evidence-larner-researchers-points"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; pharmacologist Osama Harraz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-early-warning-sign-of-dementia-risk-may-be-keeping-you-up-at-night"&gt;An Early Warning Sign of Dementia Risk May Be Keeping You Up at Night&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.ctm.2020.01.005"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"&gt;endothelial cells&lt;/a&gt;, which line the inside of blood vessels, the team looked specifically at the protein Piezo1 – a pressure 'sensor' in the cells. When this sensor is overactivated, it can disrupt the brain's blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By analyzing brain activity in mice, they determined that a fat molecule called PIP2 acts as a brake on Piezo1. When &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/neurons-in-the-brain-appear-to-follow-a-distinct-mathematical-pattern"&gt;brain cells are active&lt;/a&gt;, PIP2 levels are low, and Piezo1 is activated, increasing blood flow to where it is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_187975" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-187975" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/BrainAnalysis.jpg" alt="Brain analysis" class="wp-image-187975 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/BrainAnalysis.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/BrainAnalysis-600x333.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-187975" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Researcher Osama Harraz at work analyzing brain vasculature.

This led to Piezo1 overactivating, boosting blood flow to areas where it wasn't required and disrupting overall circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, when the researchers restored PIP2 levels in these mice, normal blood flow patterns were largely recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's still early days in understanding exactly how this mechanism works – this was a short-term study that only looked at mice – but it's another promising area to explore when it comes to investigating the underlying &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/major-study-links-15-factors-to-early-dementia-risk"&gt;drivers of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-may-be-tied-to-vascular-dementia-cases-review-finds"&gt;Vascular dementia&lt;/a&gt;, in which impaired blood flow to the brain is a key contributor, is one of the most common forms of dementia, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/17474930251404243"&gt;affecting millions&lt;/a&gt; worldwide. Blood flow problems are also thought to play a role in Alzheimer's disease, although the damaging buildup of toxic proteins is likely more significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As blood flow controls the delivery of oxygen and nutrients &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-high-fat-meal-can-disrupt-blood-flow-to-your-brain-study-finds"&gt;to the brain&lt;/a&gt;, the implications extend beyond dementia. Maintaining the right balance is essential for keeping the brain functioning properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings establish the foundation for a therapeutic approach for improving cerebral blood flow in conditions where Piezo1 activity is altered and could have impacts beyond brain blood flow control," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2522750122"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" class="alignnone wp-image-189354 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While our understanding of dementia is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-early-warning-sign-of-dementia-risk-may-be-keeping-you-up-at-night"&gt;steadily improving&lt;/a&gt;, there's still a lot we don't know about how these diseases begin or why some people are more vulnerable than others. Even with vascular dementia, it's not clear what all of the contributing factors to blood flow might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies like this help fill in those gaps by identifying the molecular players involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers plan to look at precisely how PIP2 interacts with Piezo1. Understanding that interaction will be crucial for controlling this system and potentially restoring healthy blood flow – and perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/promising-new-drug-reverses-mental-decline-in-mice-with-advanced-alzheimers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cognitive function&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are uncovering the complex mechanisms of these devastating conditions, and now we can begin to think about how to translate this biology into therapies," &lt;a href="https://www.uvm.edu/larnermed/medcommunications/news/r1-larner-spotlight-new-evidence-larner-researchers-points"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Harraz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2522750122"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

They also have a higher risk of a late-stage diagnosis compared with their white counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prostate Cancer UK highlighted the apparent “postcode lottery” with regard to testing and diagnoses of the disease. It found that rates of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing were highest in the south-east of England and lowest in the north-west.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Men living in areas of higher deprivation were 29% more likely to be diagnosed with cancer that had spread than those living in more affluent areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Chiara De Biase, the director of health services, equity and improvement at Prostate Cancer UK, said risk awareness campaigns had played a big part in the overall increase, which had led to “more men than ever being diagnosed and treated”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Prostate cancer is now the most common cancer in the UK, but despite this, men are facing deeply unfair inequities across the country, and their experiences vary hugely based on where they live,” De Biase said. “We urgently need an early detection programme that will address these regional inequities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="470ecd2a-63ac-4586-b5ed-e0f666448292" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":9,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"NHS expands access to prostate cancer drug in England to save thousands of lives","elementId":"470ecd2a-63ac-4586-b5ed-e0f666448292","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/jan/16/prostate-cancer-drug-abiraterone-nhs-england"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She added: “Mass risk-awareness campaigns have played a big part in causing this increase, such as how in February 2022, we launched a national campaign with the NHS to reach men across the UK to get them to check their risk of prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We also know that when celebrities like Bill Turnbull, Nick Owen and Colin McFarlane share their prostate cancer stories, men can be encouraged to ask about a test themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Last year, prostate cancer became &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/28/prostate-cancer-becomes-most-common-cancer-diagnosis-in-england" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the most common cancer in England&lt;/a&gt;, but new figures from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland enabled the UK-wide analysis. In Scotland there were 5,608 prostate cancer diagnoses, an increase of 30% compared with previous figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ian Walker, the executive director of policy at Cancer Research UK, said that the figures could be affected by overdiagnosis of the disease, “where PSA tests in asymptomatic men could be spotting cancers that wouldn’t cause any harm”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A panel of expert government health advisers in November said prostate cancer screening &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/28/prostate-cancer-screening-not-expected-to-be-made-widely-available-in-uk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;should not be made available&lt;/a&gt; to the vast majority of men across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The UK National Screening Committee instead recommended that there should be a targeted screening programme for men with a confirmed BRCA1 or BRCA2 faulty gene variant, which means they are more at risk of faster growing and aggressive cancers at an earlier age. Men in that category could be screened every two years between the ages of 45 and 61, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This is despite campaigners and charities calling for men at higher risk of developing the disease, such as black men and those with a family history of the cancer, to have screening available to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A Department of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and Social Care spokesperson said: “We are determined to improve outcomes for men with prostate cancer, and we know that too many men in deprived communities are being diagnosed at a later stage when the disease is harder to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Last week the NHS expanded access to abiraterone – a treatment that can significantly improve survival rates and give patients precious extra years of life and we are also making progress on cutting cancer waiting times – in the last 12 months, 213,000 more patients received a diagnosis for suspected cancer on time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 00:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxOUkM3bWR3RXlmMTd4aWtFYUw5NXFpT094NHVINXpDN0ZEZGp4MnJXREI3VXZCU2lYcWVoTFkyQ2tKMVZEX2F4WWVtRV9vbzE4WGh3aElZMTFVYlBzc3BhOXBpOFlYZGs1VlA1M1Q0YXVsbHdPX3JtMV9GTzJfNm51OTBtVXpmTXFhYTFvbm1WV0ZpN0NGSjhrLUt6SGE0RmgwYmFTUlh2Z29kcFhjYmttS2h4T0NXZllSTzA4</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现人体炎症的天然“关闭开关” - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/scientists-discover-the-bodys-natural-off-switch-for-inflammation/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 22:49:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPbXF6SGJnc3BtT0tXWGRxdS1FNWp1Z0lDXzRYbU5ZdmRBOWpMaFN5MWp6ME9nSmZmQWpZclg5Q2xPUE13SDQ1OUR4eHpnVkJZeUE2WXlJdHduNXlvR3UtWXZxbzBJdlViMzNWZ2VsUFRyTVZpTjdWTE1oSnhWNzZGWFJnMHQxOXJUM0hPSlpiN0NMem0tUGc</guid></item><item><title>根据心脏病专家的说法， 50岁以上的人应该在1月份进行一次心脏相关的血液检查- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/one-heart-related-blood-test-192500283.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying on top of all the appointments it takes to stay healthy can be challenging.

Many people don’t skip appointments intentionally—they simply run out of time or assume they’ll get to it “later.” Unfortunately, later has a way of turning into years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One easy way to stay on top of it: Make &lt;a href="https://parade.com/living/january-holidays-observances" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:January;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;January&lt;/a&gt; the month you get all your crucial health appointments on the books. Even if the actual appointments are spread out throughout the year, you’ll at least have a plan and know they’ll get done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scheduling ahead can also help you be more strategic about your care. When appointments are on the calendar, you’re more likely to follow through, track trends over time and notice changes that might otherwise slip by unnoticed. It can also make it easier to coordinate visits and lab work, rather than scrambling when something feels off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re in good health, it can be tempting to skip seeing your doctor for a yearly checkup. But according to a cardiologist, there’s one important heart-related blood test it’s crucial to get, especially if you’re 50 or older. Otherwise, you could miss out on knowing some important information about your heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/stethoscope" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🩺;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;🩺&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/healthy-now-2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/pill" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:💊;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;💊&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Heart-Related Blood Test Everyone 50 and Older Should Get&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Blood sample tube for apolipoprotein B test&amp;amp;sol;Getty Image&lt;span class="caption-credit"&gt; (Blood sample tube for apolipoprotein B test&amp;amp;sol;Getty Image)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;How’s your &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-to-do-daily-to-lower-ldl-cholesterol-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cholesterol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;? Whether you think you know or you have no idea, you can likely benefit from getting an ApoB test. “An ApoB test is a type of cholesterol test that your health care provider can order. It is not part of the traditional cholesterol or lipid panel test and is ordered separately,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.umms.org/find-a-doctor/profiles/dr-alex-athan-gyftopoulos-md-1568718112" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Alex A. Gyftopoulos, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Alex A. Gyftopoulos, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist at the University of Maryland Medical Center and an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Maryland Medical Center Midtown Campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/more-important-heart-health-lowering-dietary-cholesterol-saturated-fat-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:What's More Important for Heart Health: Lowering Dietary Cholesterol or Saturated Fat?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;What's More Important for Heart Health: Lowering Dietary Cholesterol or Saturated Fat?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gyftopoulos explains that a traditional cholesterol test checks levels of HDL “good” cholesterol and LDL “bad” cholesterol. But, he says, cholesterol is more complex than what checking these two levels shows. “ApoB, or &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538139/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:apolipoprotein B;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;apolipoprotein B&lt;/a&gt;, is a part of every different type of cholesterol in the body that has been associated with the development of plaque in the arteries that can result in &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/silent-heart-attack-symptom-not-to-ignore-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart attacks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/silent-stroke-symptoms-according-to-neurologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:strokes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;strokes&lt;/a&gt;. ApoB can give individuals a more accurate depiction of their heart disease risk,” Dr. Gyftopoulos says. But since it’s not included with the typical cholesterol test, you have to ask for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re between the ages of 45 and 65,&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/11920-cholesterol-numbers-what-do-they-mean" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:it’s recommended;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; it’s recommended&lt;/a&gt; to get a traditional cholesterol test every one to two years, depending on your risk factors. If you’re 65 or older, it’s recommended to get your cholesterol checked every year. While there aren’t set recommendations on how often to get an ApoB test, getting one every couple of years can help give you and your doctor a better picture of your heart health, especially if cardiovascular disease, stroke or heart attack runs in your family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/cardiologist-morning-habit-for-heart-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:'I'm a Cardiologist—This Is the One Thing I Always Do as Soon as I Wake Up in the Morning';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;'I'm a Cardiologist—This Is the One Thing I Always Do as Soon as I Wake Up in the Morning'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cholesterol testing is individualized based on a person’s medical history, family history and other risk factors. All adults should have their cholesterol tested and including ApoB with that testing can give a more accurate picture of someone's overall risk for heart disease and stroke,” Dr. Gyftopoulos says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Happens if You Never Get an ApoB Test?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not getting an ApoB test can mean missing out on some potentially life-saving information. “For many people, the traditional lipid panel will provide enough information to make lifestyle and treatment decisions. But for some, ApoB can uncover an increased risk for heart disease and stroke that may otherwise be missed. Now that ApoB testing is well validated and available, there is little reason not to include it when evaluating the risk for cardiovascular disease,” Dr. Gyftopoulos says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens after you get the results of your ApoB test? Now, you and your doctor can assess if any changes to your diet or lifestyle need to be made to support your heart health, or if you could benefit from cholesterol-lowering medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/how-many-minutes-should-you-walk-per-day-to-boost-heart-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Exactly How Many Minutes of Walking You Need To Do Per Day To Boost Heart Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Exactly How Many Minutes of Walking You Need To Do Per Day To Boost Heart Health &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Knowing your risk for heart disease and stroke can help you and your health care provider decide on lifestyle changes and medications that can be used to reduce your risk,” Dr. Gyftopoulos says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/24992-apolipoprotein-b-test" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ApoB test results;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ApoB test results&lt;/a&gt; can range from 20 and 400 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Apo B higher than 130 mg/dL is considered to be higher than optimal and indicates a higher risk for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your ApoB test results are higher than 130 mg/dL, Dr. Gyftopoulos says that the first step is to consider your diet and lifestyle habits. If you use tobacco, it’s a major sign to stop. If you’re not getting regular cardiovascular exercise or aren’t eating a nutrient-rich diet, your ApoB test results are a red flag indicating that you need to make some changes. For some, Dr. Gyftopoulos says that cholesterol-lowering medication may be recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is power, especially when it comes to your health. The more you know about your body, the more you know how you can best support it. An ApoB test is one powerful way to clue you in on how your heart is doing.

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span class="dropCap"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; have been practicing medicine for more than 40 years. During that time the management of obesity and Type 2 diabetes (T2DM)—the kind that usually is caused by being overweight—often felt like Sisyphus pushing a boulder up a hill, only to have it roll back down, often heavier than before. We faced a “diabesity” epidemic where the available tools were blunt instruments at best. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle interventions—meaning trying to get someone to change their behavior—was the most and least effective method we had. Most, because in the less than two percent of patients who were successful, it works very well. Least, because, well … 98 percent failed. And they failed because all of our evolutionary history (“See food? Eat it!”) was working against them. This is the mismatch theory: a mismatch between the environment of our evolutionary ancestry that designed our brains to seek foods that were at once rare and nutritious (sweets and fats) and the modern environment in which such foods are in such overabundance that we eat far beyond the saturation point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pharmacological options were often disappointing: Sulfonylureas and insulin lower blood sugar but caused weight gain, exacerbating the underlying problem. Bariatric surgery works, but it is invasive and carries surgical as well as lifelong nutritional risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt"&gt;When we look at the data for GLP receptor agonists, along with the innumerable before and after photos of successful weight loss transformations, we are forced to admit that we have moved from a realm of wishful thinking into one of potent pharmacology.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Into this therapeutic desert crawled the Gila Monster (above), a venomous lizard native to the American Southwest from which researchers derived GLP receptor agonists (Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists)—medications that mimic the natural GLP-1 hormone that lead to lower blood sugar, help control appetite, and promote weight loss by telling the pancreas to release more insulin when glucose is high, slowing the rate of stomach emptying, and signaling to the brain a sense of fullness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a skeptic, I am allergic to the word “miracle,” but when we look at the data for GLP receptor agonists, along with the innumerable before and after photos of successful weight loss transformations, we are forced to admit that we have moved from a realm of wishful thinking into one of potent pharmacology. But, as always in medicine, there is no free lunch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-incretin-concept-from-gut-to-glory"&gt;The Incretin Concept: From Gut to Glory &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story begins with the “incretin effect”—the observation that glucose taken by mouth triggers a much stronger insulin response by increasing the production of hormones in the pancreas, compared to when it is injected directly into a vein. The gut knows you are eating and tells the pancreas to get ready to pack away the extra calories as fat. In patients with Type 2 diabetes, this effect is blunted and the sugar floats around in the bloodstream much longer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists identified two main hormones responsible: Glucose-dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide (GIP) and Glucagon-like Peptide (GLP-1). The problem is that GIP doesn’t work well in diabetics. GLP-1 works beautifully—stimulating insulin, suppressing glucagon, and slowing gastric emptying—but it has a fatal flaw: It is destroyed by the enzyme DPP-4 within minutes of entering the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This led to two distinct pharmaceutical strategies. The earlier version was DPP-4 Inhibitors. Drugs like the “Gliptins” block DPP-4, making GLP-1 last longer. They are well-tolerated but their ability to lower blood sugar is modest and they generally do not cause weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newer strategy was to engineer versions of GLP to resist degradation. This is where the Gila monster strolled in. In the 1990s, while researching hormone-like drugs, Dr. John Eng noted a similarity between &lt;em&gt;exendin-4&lt;/em&gt; found in Gila venom to Glucagon-like peptide (GLP), and it was able to resist breakdown by DPP! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-evidence-efficacy-beyond-the-hype"&gt;The Evidence: Efficacy Beyond the Hype &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first GLP-1 agonist, exenatide (Byetta, approved in 2005), required twice-daily injections and produced modest weight loss. But the pharmacology evolved rapidly. We moved to once-daily liraglutide, and then to the once-weekly heavyweights: dulaglutide, semaglutide (Ozempic and Wegovy), and the dual GIP and GLP-1 agonist tirzepatide (Mounjaro and Zepbound). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinical trials, called LEAD, SUSTAIN, PIONEER, STEP, and SURPASS (you’ve got to just love the creative acronyms!) have generated data that are hard to dismiss: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glycemic Control&lt;/strong&gt;: These drugs consistently outperform most oral antidiabetics in lowering blood sugar by 10 to 20 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight Loss&lt;/strong&gt;: This is the game changer. While early drugs produced 2–4 kg of weight loss over six months, the newer agents are producing results previously only seen with surgery. In the STEP-1 trial, semaglutide 2.4 mg resulted in an approximately 15 percent body weight reduction. Tirzepatide pushed this further, achieving up to 22 percent weight loss in the SURMOUNT-1 trial. That is the effect of a 250-pound person losing 55 pounds! Who wouldn’t want some of that?! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardiovascular Outcomes&lt;/strong&gt;: Perhaps most importantly, these drugs are not like some that just make numbers look better; they are saving lives. Liraglutide and semaglutide have demonstrated significant reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including heart attack and stroke, in high-risk populations. The SELECT trial recently showed semaglutide reduces MACE by 20 percent even in nondiabetic patients with cardiovascular disease. But don’t be fooled, it is not likely that these drugs have specific effects on the heart. It is probable that the fat loss alone is causing these benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="some-skeptical-scrutiny-the-risks"&gt;Some Skeptical Scrutiny: The Risks &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a drug sounds too good to be true, we must look for the catch. GLP-1 agonists have plenty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The “Puke” Diet?&lt;/strong&gt; The most common side effects of GLP-1 agonists are gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and bloating. In some trials, up to 45 percent of patients experienced nausea. While this usually subsides, it raises a valid question: Are people losing weight because their metabolism is optimized, or because they feel too sick to eat? The mechanism involves central appetite suppression in the hypothalamus, but the “gastric braking” effect is real and unpleasant for many. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Pancreas and Thyroid Scare&lt;/strong&gt;. Early observational data suggested a link between GLP-1 agonists and pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. However, extensive reviews have not confirmed a causal link to pancreatic cancer, though a slight increase in pancreatitis persists in some data. This makes sense, as one of the major sites of GLP’s effects is on the pancreas. In the thyroid, these drugs cause C-cell tumors in rodents. Humans have far fewer GLP-1 receptors on their thyroid C-cells than rats, and so far no evidence of increased thyroid cancer has been confirmed in humans. Still, the Black Box warning remains: If you have a family history of endocrine tumors or medullary thyroid cancer, these drugs are not for you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt"&gt;If we are simply shrinking patients without preserving their strength, we may be trading one set of problems for another.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vanishing Muscle&lt;/strong&gt;. Weight loss via GLP-1 agonists is not just fat loss, so overall body composition must be monitored. In the STEP-1 trial, DEXA scans showed that lean body mass (muscle and bone) accounted for nearly 40 percent of the weight lost. In older adults, this raises the specter of “sarcopenic obesity”—being frail and weak despite having excess fat. Losing muscle mass compromises physical function and metabolic health. If we are simply shrinking patients without preserving their strength, we may be trading one set of problems for another. Now, regular and increased exercise is part of the prescription for all patients taking GLP drugs, but studies on how well this works are still in progress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Perioperative Peril&lt;/strong&gt;. Because GLP-1 agonists delay gastric emptying, there have been reports of patients aspirating (inhaling) gastric contents during anesthesia, even after standard fasting protocols. This is a new, practical safety concern that surgical societies are rushing to address. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental Health&lt;/strong&gt;. Reports of suicidal ideation appeared in postmarketing monitoring of GLP-1 agonist users, prompting investigations by European regulators. However, recent large cohort studies have not supported an increased risk of suicidality compared to other diabetes medications. As with all centrally acting drugs, vigilance is required, but the current data are reassuring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Lifetime Prescription?&lt;/strong&gt; The most significant caveat for GLP-1 agonists is durability. Obesity can be a chronic, relapsing disease. Trials show that when patients stop taking semaglutide, they regain two-thirds of the lost weight within a year, and cardiometabolic improvements revert toward baseline. This implies that these are not “cures” but lifelong therapies, much like blood pressure medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial Toxicity&lt;/strong&gt;. As I write this, these drugs are prohibitively expensive, creating a massive public health gap. We also saw shortages that left diabetic patients unable to fill prescriptions because the supply was diverted to off-label weight loss use. GLP-1 agonists are not expensive to produce, however, and the patent on Ozempic expired in January of 2026 in Canada and China (and lasts until 2030 in the U.S.), but I expect the market to bring the costs down dramatically over the next few years. As of this year, close to 12 percent of Americans have tried it at least once. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="needles-versus-pills"&gt;Needles Versus Pills &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is one thing that holds patients back from the current crop of injectable incretins it is the needle. Despite the efficacy of weekly injections, people prefer pills. The pharmaceutical industry, never one to leave money on the table, has been racing to develop an oral alternative that doesn’t require the strict fasting rituals of earlier attempts like oral semaglutide. Enter &lt;em&gt;orforglipron&lt;/em&gt;, the latest contender in the “nonpeptide small molecule” class, which promises the benefits of GLPs without the injection or the fuss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike existing peptide predecessors that are digested by stomach acid unless armored with absorption enhancers, orforglipron is a chemical—a small molecule designed to survive the GI tract and activate the GLP-1 receptor directly. The data from the ATTAIN-1 trial, published in September 2025, look good. Patients on the 36 mg dose achieved an average weight loss of 11.2 percent over 72 weeks, compared to just 2.1 percent for placebo. No needles. And this pill does not require the “empty stomach, no water, wait 30 minutes” song-and-dance required by oral semaglutide; it can be taken with or without food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt"&gt;These are serious medications with serious side effects, and they may require lifelong commitment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, let’s look a little past the convenience. While an 11.2 percent average weight loss is clinically significant, it trails behind the 13.7 percent average reduction seen with semaglutide and 20.2 percent with tirzepatide. Furthermore, the biology of GLP-1 agonism remains the same regardless of delivery method: You cannot cheat physiology. In the ATTAIN-1 trial, adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in up to 10.3 percent of patients on the drug, compared to only 2.7 percent on placebo. The side effects are the usual suspects—gastrointestinal distress, nausea, and constipation—confirming that oral delivery does not bypass the “gastric braking” misery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We must also remain vigilant regarding safety. The development of a similar small molecule, lotiglipron, was unceremoniously halted due to liver toxicity concerns. While orforglipron has passed its Phase 3 hurdles without these specific signals so far, the history of pharmacology teaches us that rare, serious adverse events often lurk in the postmarketing shadows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, while proponents argue that small molecules are cheaper to manufacture than biologics, whether those savings will be passed on to the patient or simply absorbed into the profit margins remains to be seen, with projected self-pay costs in some cases exceeding $1,000 per month. Orforglipron represents a technological leap, but it is not a magic wand; it is simply a more convenient way to induce the same physiological trade-offs we have seen over the last several years with the shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the incretin era, our ability to manage the twin epidemics of diabetes and obesity was dishearteningly limited. GLP-1 receptor agonists represent a hard-earned pharmacological breakthrough, offering potent glucose control and unprecedented weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, skepticism is still warranted regarding their indiscriminate use. They are already being used in numerous off-label ways, like shedding a few pounds before a wedding, allegedly decreasing cravings for addictive drugs like alcohol and narcotics, and purportedly even for the treatment of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. There are ongoing studies for these uses, but early data are weak and the risks are unknown. These are serious medications with serious side effects, and they may require lifelong commitment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caveat emptor&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

She also recognizes the challenges of social vulnerability, understanding how low income, food insecurity, and limited access to health care might matter in treatment choice. After all, those factors are strongly linked to developing type 2 diabetes and obesity in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For more than a dozen years, Patti has been a leader of long-running randomized clinical trials conducted in four U.S. cities that compared bariatric surgery to medication and lifestyle management for type 2 diabetes. &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2815401" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;In 2024&lt;/a&gt;, one of those trials demonstrated the superiority of bariatric surgery for patients, measured by lower blood glucose levels, higher weight loss (28% vs. 10%), less use of diabetes medications, remission of diabetes to the point of no longer needing to inject insulin, and reduced risk factors for cardiovascular disease. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a new secondary analysis of the larger trial &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-01882" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, Patti and her colleagues asked how different social determinants of health affected outcomes after bariatric surgery compared to medical therapy for people with type 2 diabetes and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bariatric surgery was better than medical therapy across all social backgrounds, they found, and not just in areas of higher deprivation. The ancillary study was smaller, and some of the participants randomized in earlier stages crossed over from medical to surgical treatment, and the reverse. The authors acknowledged and accounted for these limitations, along with the rapid development of more powerful obesity drugs not fully captured in the study. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, “Bariatric surgery remains an underutilized approach. Even in comparison to these really wonderful medications that we now have access to, it is still better,” Patti, an endocrinologist and director of the hypoglycemia clinic at Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, told STAT. “I’m not a surgeon, but I think we need to keep in mind that surgery offers an approach which can be a durable therapy for type 2 diabetes and obesity.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;At the overall study’s start, carried out in Boston, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Seattle, 355 participants were randomly assigned to undergo medical therapy or one of three surgical approaches: gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, or adjustable gastric lap banding. Medical and lifestyle interventions, based on the well-known Diabetes Prevention Program, included individualized nutrition counseling and instruction on exercise and how to monitor glucose. As time passed, fewer people chose lap band surgery, which has now fallen out of favor, and newer obesity drugs were increasingly available in the trials’ later stages. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some people from the medication group later chose surgery, and some people who’d had surgery began taking obesity drugs. By year 12, more than a third of participants in the medical therapy groups and more than a quarter in the surgical groups were receiving incretin-based therapy, the class of drugs that includes older ones like liraglutide (sold as Saxenda) as well as newer GLP-1s like tirzepatide (sold as Mounjaro).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The smaller study analyzed data from 258 adults with type 2 diabetes who began the larger trial having either undergone bariatric surgery or received medical and lifestyle therapy. They had been sorted by their ZIP codes to identify the Area Deprivation Index for where they lived. Their weight and hemoglobin A1c levels, which measure blood glucose, were tracked for seven&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to 12 years.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While there was a trend toward better outcomes from surgery for people living in a high deprivation area, it was not statistically significant, Patti said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Navigating diabetes care alone is hard, she said, particularly when combined with socioeconomic challenges. Patients are asked to modify their diets, perhaps in ways tough on family food budgets. Exercise is important, but not always feasible for people working two jobs to make ends meet. Then there’s the medical environment, where it’s difficult even for insured people to maintain access to medications and keep taking them consistently.  “If you don’t have an advocate in the health care system and you really don’t have a way to keep up with the need for approvals or prior authorizations, being an advocate for yourself — that’s really hard when you are having many social, financial and other stressors,” Patti said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amid the enthusiasm for all things GLP-1, surgery may not be top of mind for these patients, whatever their socioeconomic circumstances. Neither approach is easy. One dividing line: If someone hopes to lose 100 pounds, that’s more likely with surgery than with medications. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s so many more options now for people, which is great. And people might end up needing more than one modality,” Melanie Jay,  a professor of medicine and population health at New York University who is also director of the NYU Langone Comprehensive Program on Obesity Research, said in an interview. She was not involved in the study. “Obesity is a disease that often needs to be managed lifelong. We don’t have a cure yet, right?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The biology behind the success of surgery or medical therapy is remarkably similar, something that may be lost in the rush to develop pills to replace injectable medications. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Surgery reduces appetite, too, changing the way nutrients interact with the intestine and resulting in increased secretion of — you guessed it — GLP-1 hormones after a meal. These hormones plus weight loss improve diabetes control. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You’re not stopping medications because of side effects or because your insurance company is not paying for it anymore,” Patti said. “So it’s a sustained way to activate the same intestinally derived mechanisms that intersect with the brain to change appetite and metabolism.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jason Samuels, a professor of surgery at Vanderbilt, argues that all therapies for obesity remain underused. Bariatric surgery, despite its track record for safety, effectiveness, and long-term durability, reaches a very small percentage of patients who qualify, he said, and medications don’t help all the people who could benefit. He was not involved in the study, which he called an important evaluation, even if outpaced by newer drugs. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Looking ahead, next-generation incretin-based agents may narrow the gap for some patients, but real-world durability, tolerability, adherence, and — critically — affordability and access will determine how closely medications can match surgical outcomes across diverse populations,” he said via email about obesity drugs. “Ultimately, we need large, long-term, well-designed studies to clarify the best strategy for a given patient.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Patti wants surgery to still be in the discussion. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We can look at epidemiology and large population studies, and they all show that bariatric surgery is more effective at improving diabetes control, improving diabetes remission, reducing complications, and prolonging survival,” she said. “But you know, when we’re talking to an individual patient, the question is, what’s the best choice for that particular patient?”&lt;/p&gt;
