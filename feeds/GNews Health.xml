Some popular peanut butter brands even boast about their protein content on their labels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FRPPVH4ONZGMRFUXDN3N44GRKQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11022925/#s0006" target="_blank"&gt;in a report&lt;/a&gt; published in a top sports nutrition journal last year, exercise and sports nutrition scientists cautioned that peanut butter isn’t as high in protein as many people think. The report noted that peanut butter is an “energy dense” food: Ounce for ounce, it has a lot more dietary fat and calories compared with eggs, Greek yogurt, lean meats, chicken breast, beans, fish and other high-protein foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RHASUYW6CJAMPKFTSOMWTRJTYE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Peanut butter is certainly nutritious. It contains &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/07/14/high-fiber-meal-plan/" target="_blank"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, vitamins, minerals and heart-healthy unsaturated fats. But it contains at least twice as many grams of fat as protein. You should consider it a great source of fat, rather than a great source of protein, said Jose Antonio, an author of the report and a professor of health and human performance at Nova Southeastern University in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VME3BIY6YFC25IYWPNMQEPYGDM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If you read the nutrition label on any jar of peanut butter, you will see that it’s mostly fat,” said Antonio, who is also the chief executive of the International Society of Sports Nutrition. “The fat is good for you. But don’t fool yourself into thinking that you’re getting a lot of high-quality protein.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XH2J4HCF6RDUZCUNWCYPZQZYYA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Two tablespoons of&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;creamy peanut butter — the amount in one serving, or one ounce — has about seven grams of protein, 16 grams of fat and 190 calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UFNDUEGEFNA6JO77UA7FF7BHFY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The authors of the report noted that people who use peanut butter to help them meet their protein needs should consider eating it in moderation because of its high &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/06/13/weight-loss-calories-fiber-microbiome/" target="_blank"&gt;calorie&lt;/a&gt; density. Otherwise, the authors warned, they may be setting themselves up for “unintentional weight gain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TC334XRZABHF3CC7P3T2KLA4HQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Peanut butter is a healthy food, but calories still matter,” Antonio said. “If you want to gain weight, eat a bunch of peanut butter. It’s not a great source of protein.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 10:36:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxOS2ZWNTdDOWEwSU5peVRzejZkblJhWVdveXdUX0RJcVZlWXhPMFBhekpreFluYm1TX3ZOVXlhWXBGOS1rblpHTGFnYmhGdGh6c2ItbXB6REljNm5MTmpPOE5yOWRyaHJLYkFLOUx0T0lKcHg4c2M4eDV1QlBFN05Fajc4Zl8</guid></item><item><title>即使是健康的大脑也会随着年龄的增长而衰退。以下是您可以做的事情-美国国家公共广播电台 | Even healthy brains decline with age.

                Even healthy brains slow down as they age. But there are ways to keep that thinker in tip-top shape.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;After about age 40, our brains begin to lose a step or two.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Each year, our reaction time slows by a few thousandths of a second. We're also less able to recall items on a shopping list.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those changes can be signs of a disease, like Alzheimer's. But usually, they're not.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Both of those things, memory and processing speed, change with age in a normal group of people," says &lt;a href="https://www.tgen.org/faculty-profiles/matt-huentelman/" target="_blank"&gt;Matt Huentelman&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at TGen, the Translational Genomics Research Institute, in Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Huentelman should know. He helps run &lt;a href="https://mindcrowd.org/" target="_blank"&gt;MindCrowd&lt;/a&gt;, a free online cognitive test that has been taken by more than 700,000 adults.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;About a thousand of those people had test scores indicating that their brain was "exceptional," meaning they performed like a person 30 years younger on tests of memory and processing speed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Genetics played a role, of course. But Huentelman and a team of researchers have been focusing on other differences.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"We want to study these exceptional performers because we think they can tell us what the rest of us should be doing," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Early results suggest that sleep and maintaining cardiovascular health are a good start. Other &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30367-6/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;measures&lt;/a&gt; include avoiding smoking, limiting alcohol and getting plenty of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Huentelman was one of several dozen researchers who met in Miami this summer to discuss healthy brain aging. The event was hosted by the &lt;a href="https://mcknightbrain.org/" target="_blank"&gt;McKnight Brain Research Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, which funds studies on age-related cognitive decline and memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To preserve cognitive function in later life, "we're going to have to understand [brain] aging at a mechanistic level," says &lt;a href="https://mcknightbrain.org/the-mcknight-brain-research-foundation-announces-alice-luo-clayton-phd-as-chief-executive-officer/" target="_blank"&gt;Alice Luo Clayton&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroscientist who is the group's chief executive officer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Another speaker was &lt;a href="https://mbi-umiami.org/lab-member/christian-agudelo-md/" target="_blank"&gt;Christian Agudelo&lt;/a&gt;, a sleep neurologist at the University of Miami's Evelyn F. McKnight Brain Institute.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think the value of sleep and sleep deprivation became true to me when I had kids," Agudelo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those kids are 4 and 6 now, so Agudelo is getting more sleep. But his own experience is consistent with his &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.12250" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; on the relationship between sleep and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"The better you sleep, the better your brain health is going to be both structurally and functionally," Agudelo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind: Better sleep isn't just about getting more sleep.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The key is getting high-quality sleep, which allows the brain to cycle through all the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526132/" target="_blank"&gt;sleep stages&lt;/a&gt;, Agudelo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers can measure how well a person is sleeping by monitoring their brain wave patterns. But people usually know when they've had a good night's rest, Agudelo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You go to sleep, you wake up and you feel like that experience was worthwhile," he says. "You feel refreshed."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Ensuring high-quality sleep is tricky. But people can improve the odds with certain behaviors, Agudelo says&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Waking up at the same time every single day and aligning our sleep rhythms with the rhythm of the sun" can lead to better sleep, he says. So can "being active, both socially and physically."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those behaviors increase "sleep pressure," the body's natural desire to sleep the longer we are awake, Agudelo says. When that pressure is high, he says, "we can fall asleep more easily and deeply."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Brain aging is also influenced by vascular risk factors, like blood pressure, cholesterol levels and diabetes, says &lt;a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/medical-center/team/639/charles-decarli---neurology---dementia---alzheimer-s-disease-sacramento/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles DeCarli&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist who co-directs the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the University of California, Davis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People know that these risk factors usually contribute to medical conditions like heart attack or stroke, DeCarli says. But &lt;a href="https://diversevcid.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; on thousands of people 65 and older has found that these risk factors can also impact the brain directly — even if they don't cause a heart attack or other cardiovascular problems.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The size of the brain, the shape of the brain, the tissue integrity of the brain looks older in people who have these risk factors than in people who do not have them," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So DeCarli and a team of researchers are studying whether it's possible to protect the brain by aggressively treating conditions that affect the circulatory system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The question is, if you have these diseases and they are well controlled, will you have a younger-looking brain?" he says. "And the answer seems to be yes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The result? Poor focus, memory glitches, and emotional fatigue. I’ve developed five daily habits — used with patients and in my own life — that help restore clarity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen more frazzled, forgetful, foggy patients this year than ever before. Not because they’re sick. Not because they’re old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But because their brains are overstimulated and undernourished in ways we still don’t fully understand. “I forget words mid-sentence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My brain feels like a browser with 78 tabs open.” “Even when I rest, &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/tiny-signs-chronic-fatigue-system"&gt;I feel tired&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These aren’t rare comments. I hear them every day — like the mother of three who told me she forgot her ATM PIN at checkout, or the tech worker who confessed he hasn’t read a full email in months.  From executives. From teachers. From teenagers. This is a clinical reality, not just a vibe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;As a doctor, I’ve come to believe we’re living through a silent cognitive crisis, and that's why everyone's brains feel so broken right now. &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-07/why-everyones-brain-feels-so-broken-right-now.png" alt="woman who's brain feels broken" title="why everyone's brain feels so broken right now" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;CrizzyStudio / Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not dementia. Not quite depression. Something subtler — and more pervasive. A kind of neural exhaustion from too many inputs, too few boundaries, and no clear &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/simple-steps-help-you-hit-reset-button-your-life-only-15-minutes"&gt;way to reset&lt;/a&gt;. The science is beginning to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;We’re starting to understand how constant stimulation physically reshapes the brain. We were never built for this.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what I see in the clinic every week: A lawyer tells me he’s making more mistakes in briefs than ever before. A college student describes &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/people-who-suddenly-lose-interest-everyone-around-them-often-have-these-reasons"&gt;losing interest in everything&lt;/a&gt;, even her favorite books. A nurse forgets common medication names during shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of them is sick. All of them are overwhelmed. And it’s not just mental. It’s physical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their nervous systems are stuck in a mild but constant state of fight-or-flight. Their pulse is up. Their sleep is down. And their minds can’t seem to slow down, even when their bodies try. We weren’t built for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/people-maintain-discipline-say-no-without-feeling-guilty-have-these-strengths"&gt;People Who Maintain The Discipline To Say No Without Feeling Guilty Have These 5 Strengths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your brain doesn't work in modern life. In medical terms, here’s what we think is happening: Brain scans now reveal that chronic overstimulation — including scrolling, alerts, newsfeeds, and multitasking — shrinks the prefrontal cortex, heightens stress pathways, and overwhelms the brain with noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cortisol overdrive:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/subtle-ways-stress-completely-messes-up-your-life"&gt;Chronic stress&lt;/a&gt;, even mild, keeps the stress hormone cortisol elevated, leading to memory impairment and mood instability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Default Mode Network disruption:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain’s Default Mode Network (DMN) — active during rest and introspection — supports creativity, memory, and self-awareness. But constant task-switching and alerts suppress DMN activity, preventing the brain from entering deeper states of reflection and consolidation. Harvard and UC studies suggest this disruption may reduce creative insight and cognitive resilience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopamine dysregulation:&lt;/strong&gt; Constant hits of novelty (social media, texts, headlines) mess with our motivation system. What used to feel rewarding — a walk, a conversation — feels dull by comparison.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/productive-people-avoid-these-things-like-plague"&gt;The Top 1% Of Productive People Avoid These 8 Things Like The Plague&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result: A pervasive sense that we’re always behind, always distracted, and never really resting. Here are the five strategies I recommend most often. Not supplements. Not brain games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Here are five simple, evidence-backed tools that help reset the brain and make it feel less broken:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Start your day with a light, not a screen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunlight (or a 10,000 lux lamp) within 30 minutes of waking boosts alertness, mood, and circadian rhythm regulation. Scrolling does the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Protect at least one “deep work” block&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even 45 minutes a day of uninterrupted focus, with no pings or multitasking, can &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/things-laser-focused-people-do-stay-on-task-finish-stuff"&gt;rebuild attention networks&lt;/a&gt; over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Reclaim boredom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let yourself do nothing — no phone, no podcast, no input — for 5–10 minutes a day. This reactivates the Default Mode Network (DMN), the brain’s system for creativity, memory, and self-reflection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DMN becomes active when you’re not focused on external tasks — during rest, daydreaming, or mind-wandering. Doing nothing — especially without digital stimulation — helps engage this network, supporting:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creativity&lt;/strong&gt; (idea generation, divergent thinking)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autobiographical memory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future planning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem-solving&lt;/strong&gt; rooted in personal experience&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/health-wellness/everyday-habits-can-damage-your-brain-according-research"&gt;11 Everyday Habits That Can Damage Your Brain, According To Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Use your eyes to calm the mind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lateral eye movement — like looking side to side while walking outdoors or deliberately scanning the horizon — activates the parasympathetic system and reduces stress. Even 5 minutes of this, especially in nature, can lower heart rate and improve focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Schedule a daily digital reset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choose a fixed time (even 20 minutes) when all devices go off. Treat it like a prescription. This single boundary can lower anxiety and help your brain transition from reaction to reflection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One patient — a 39-year-old software project manager — implemented all five of these habits over a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Day 4, her headaches stopped. By Day 6, she told me her memory had “snapped back.” By Day 7, she had read a book cover to cover for the first time in two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t magic. It’s neurology. A week of &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/plant-habits-now-enjoy-good-life-years-to-come"&gt;intentional habits&lt;/a&gt; can change how your brain feels and functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;If your brain feels broken lately, it’s not a personal failure — it’s a system failure. &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are living in a world designed to fracture our attention and monetize our exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you can push back. You can &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/ways-set-much-needed-boundary-without-saying-single-word"&gt;create boundaries&lt;/a&gt;. You can heal your focus.

          &lt;p&gt;A sweeping analysis of health data from more than 1.2 million children in Denmark born over a 24-year period found no link between the small amounts of aluminum in vaccines and a wide range of health conditions—including asthma, allergies, eczema, autism, and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finding, &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00997"&gt;published in the Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, firmly squashes a persistent anti-vaccine talking point that can give vaccine-hesitant parents pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small amounts of aluminum salts have been added to vaccines for decades as adjuvants, that is, components of the vaccine that help drum up protective immune responses against a target germ. Aluminum adjuvants can be found in a variety of vaccines, including those against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, &lt;em&gt;Haemophilus influenzae&lt;/em&gt; type b (Hib), and hepatitis A and B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of use worldwide and no clear link to harms, concern about aluminum and cumulative exposures continually resurfaces—largely thanks to anti-vaccine advocates who fearmonger about the element. A leader of such voices is Robert F. Kennedy Jr, the current US health secretary and an ardent anti-vaccine advocate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/p6LJXPOv4SM?t=3885"&gt;a June 2024 interview with podcaster Joe Rogan&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy falsely claimed that aluminum is "extremely neurotoxic" and "give[s] you allergies." The podcast has racked up nearly 2 million views on YouTube. Likewise, Children's Health Defense, the rabid anti-vaccine organization &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/robert-f-kennedy-jr-announces-the-launch-of-childrens-health-defense-300710874.html"&gt;Kennedy created in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, has also made &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/search/?search=aluminum"&gt;wild claims about the safety of aluminum adjuvants&lt;/a&gt;. That includes linking it to &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/high-aluminum-found-autism-brain-tissue/"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;, despite that &lt;a href="https://www.immunize.org/wp-content/uploads/catg.d/p4026.pdf"&gt;many high-quality scientific studies&lt;/a&gt; have found &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2908388/"&gt;no link&lt;/a&gt; between any vaccines and autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While anti-vaccine advocates like Kennedy routinely dismiss and attack the plethora of studies that do not support their dangerous claims, the new study should reassure any hesitant parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clear data, unclear future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the study, lead author Niklas Worm Andersson, of the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, and colleagues tapped into Denmark's national registry to analyze medical records of over 1.2 million children born in the country between 1997 and 2018. During that time, new vaccines were introduced and recommendations shifted, creating variation in how many aluminum-containing vaccines children received.&lt;/p&gt;

But new research from Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University suggests this long-standing advice may be outdated — and unnecessarily costly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="O47LVBCYVNBDZIZGAPBXXQFJ54"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/cmr.00031-25" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;study published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, OHSU scientists argue that adults who completed their childhood vaccinations may not need tetanus or diphtheria boosters nearly as often as previously thought. Their findings suggest protection lasts far longer for most healthy adults — at least 30 years, and possibly for life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SRHNCEKEWZC6JC7PXTOKXFOG54"&gt;“Why keep vaccinating adults every 10 years?

But Slifka said this guidance hasn’t kept pace with mounting evidence that immunity to these diseases — now rare in the U.S. thanks to widespread childhood vaccination — doesn’t require such frequent upkeep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ASLTSYTDFZGRLMBO3424BK6B7E"&gt;“Tetanus and diphtheria are among our most successful vaccines,” he said. “Their effectiveness has virtually eliminated these diseases in countries with high childhood vaccination coverage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TUONDJ2BZNFNHPSGTKAHHRMOEM"&gt;Tetanus, a severe bacterial disease caused by spores commonly found in soil, manure or dust, now occurs in the U.S. at a rate of less than one case per 10 million people annually.

His findings suggest that for adults who received the standard five-dose childhood vaccine series, immunity often lasts for life — making routine boosters largely unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:VFGBCU7HQRBXJE7QU65XVOPECQ" data-fusion-component="VFGBCU7HQRBXJE7QU65XVOPECQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:VFGBCU7HQRBXJE7QU65XVOPECQ" data-fusion-component="VFGBCU7HQRBXJE7QU65XVOPECQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VUC5ZPJWE5F2RC3UH2MZYDOBGU"&gt;Based on the evidence, the researchers propose a simpler, age-based schedule: a booster at age 30 and another at 60. They say that would eliminate the confusion and burden of trying to recall the date of one’s last shot every decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UBBCDABNSNDS5KLXJTNCDTPLDQ"&gt;Slifka said “this idea isn’t a radical change,” as similar policies exist abroad. The United Kingdom, for example, doesn’t recommend routine adult boosters and has maintained low rates of both diseases, even during a 2022 influx of more than 70 diphtheria cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="X7HRTR64UFHVFHAKUGYPQ7WZQY"&gt;The World Health Organization dropped its recommendation for routine adult boosters in 2017, advising them only in specific circumstances such as pregnancy, travel, or wound care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YXBKNZR7OFGPROTROSIIYEJOGQ"&gt;Meanwhile, more than 18 million Americans receive these boosters annually, costing over $1 billion. The researchers say a 30-year schedule could cut vaccination costs by two-thirds, saving around $280 million each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="Z6BHZSGDDFHGRNXU7STUBR57FM"&gt;Slifka said eliminating unnecessary boosters — while continuing vaccinations for pregnant women, people with wounds and those with uncertain vaccine history — could free up resources for other public health priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MUZ57AU4YZFFRJCILXMYT2HDBQ"&gt;“If we could use some of these funds that we save and use it to deal with vaccine hesitancy and vaccine education, then I think we could really put that money to good use,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" data-gaid="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5RNOZUYBLZGJTDA3TWO5NWBIZI"&gt;Slifka said that while the study suggests boosters may not be needed as often, it should not be seen as a reason to overlook the importance of childhood vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16" data-gaid="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5GTW3OYJ55H3BHXPDS6WQBEV2M"&gt;“Vaccines work, and they work for a long time,” he said. “By maintaining strong, consistent childhood vaccination programs, we’re able to reduce or eliminate these booster vaccinations for adults.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17" data-gaid="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BKSRW2T5OFDHBJYHC7XJCB2QKU"&gt;Changes to official guidelines would require review by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the group responsible for setting vaccine policy in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18" data-gaid="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OY5KBOME3JHXNMCCDACSSK4ZBE"&gt;Slifka hopes this new evidence sparks a fresh look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-19" data-gaid="inarticle-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QMFPSIIFIRFWZMUB7RZHSFKOGM"&gt;“The wheels of science turn slowly,” he said. “But we think it’s time to bring this back up for discussion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-20" data-gaid="inarticle-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--center skimlinks"&gt;If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.&lt;span&gt; By using this site, you consent to our &lt;a href="https://www.advancelocal.com/advancelocalUserAgreement/user-agreement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;User Agreement&lt;/a&gt; and agree that your clicks, interactions, and personal information may be collected, recorded, and/or stored by us and social media and other third-party partners in accordance with our &lt;a href="https://www.advancelocal.com/advancelocalUserAgreement/privacy-policy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Privacy Policy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>OregonLive.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 21:43:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>PHMDC在药物过量服用增加后发布公共卫生警报- Channel 3000 | PHMDC issues public health alert after increase in drug overdoses - Channel 3000</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi4gFBVV95cUxOelB2cVNMS0dINmNnWThXZ3ZnY1otcE1VaW1kNjBKakk2MDVVc0xZTDNZZTQzaDYwZmhrR3czcElWd0k1UUJ2QTR0VEwwUGs3ZFlUbGY3R1MyNWZITWVVc3BuVjZGU1FYLTBTUnBKM2RKeEFfcDdBWFZlaHlLMmM2UG1nd0ZCLUppUGZaVXp6NnM0UmNqRF81WHJ0NXE2d3pNQUhxR1F1UHR0QW9fNVRoUXJlb0VrNHFwaEYtcDlscHdpRm54MFduTXV6aU5OT1Bjbnl1UTUyTjI1RVVVTDVack5n?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody" class="asset-content  subscriber-premium" false&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;MADISON, Wis. -- Public Health Madison &amp;amp; Dane County issued a public health alert on Tuesday due to an increase in drug overdoses in Dane County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHMDC reported the alert is based on data from hospitals and EMS providers. Within 24 hours, July 13 to July 14, there were five confirmed overdose response calls from EMS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unknown what is driving this spike. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Drug use during the summer months can also increase the risk of heat-related illnesses, like heat stroke and dehydration." "This is because certain types of drugs raise core body temperature and interfere with the body’s ability to regulate temperature,” said Public Health Supervisor Julia Olson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you or someone you know is using drugs, PHMDC gave the following tips:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=misAs9xKO8s" target="_blank"&gt;Know the signs of an overdose:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pale, sweaty or clammy skin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lips/fingertips turn blue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slow or irregular breathing: gasping, gurgling, or snoring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficult or unable to wake&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always call 911 if you think someone is overdosing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t use street drugs alone; call Never Use Alone at 800-484-3731&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Check in with your friends/family who use drugs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Test all drugs for fentanyl before using&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carry Narcan® (naloxone) and be prepared to use multiple doses when needed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get safer use supplies, like fentanyl test strips and Narcan®, from the Syringe Services Program at Public Health Madison &amp;amp; Dane County: 2705 E. Washington Ave. or 2300 S. Park St. in Madison&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contact the Behavioral Health Resource Center of Dane County for treatment and recovery resources: (608) 267-2244&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Share this alert with others&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;​COPYRIGHT 2025 BY CHANNEL 3000.

"It opens the door to deadly disease outbreaks and puts even more pressure on health systems that are already stretched.

In 2024, 89% of infants globally, equivalent to about 115 million, received at least one dose of the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP)-containing vaccine, and 85%, roughly 109 million, completed all three doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;By comparison, in 2023, about 171,000 more children received at least one vaccine and one million more children received the three doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Protection against measles also improved, with 84% of children receiving the first dose and 76% receiving the second dose.

But millions of children remain without protection against preventable diseases, and that should worry us all," Catherine Russell, executive director of UNICEF, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We must act now with determination to overcome barriers like shrinking health budgets, fragile health systems along with misinformation and access constraints because of conflicts. No child should die from a disease we know how to prevent," Russell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The release of the data came just a few weeks after Health and Human Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the U.S. was pulling its funding from GAVI, an international organization that works to improve access to vaccines, claiming the organization "ignored the science."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Kennedy claimed in a &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nHT8IvaA4A" target="_blank"&gt;video posted online&lt;/a&gt; that the U.S. had provided $8 billion in funding to GAVI since 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Public health officials called on governments around the world to help fill the gaps in funding, although the U.S. withholding funds was not explicitly stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"It is really, really important that maintaining these coverage trends, which are quite easily fragile unless efforts are sustained," Dr. Ephrem Lemango, associate director for health and global chief of immunization at UNICEF, said during Monday's press briefing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;"It is important that we maintain our commitment to immunization, and we're calling on governments and partners and communities to do all that is necessary to maintain immunization coverage, including closing the funding gaps, serving communities in conflict and fragile settings, and addressing misinformation," Lemango said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News - Breaking News, Latest News and Videos</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 20:27:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxONWdhLWFvLXNoaV9vYm1wcHI4WEhnNDA5NTBHalJ1YjBpbXBaZFJRVFlvTVhDR09PN2c3OVVzVlVPVWRJbVV1NnNZbjFDcVFOS3FTRUVZQ0F4UDAtd2VLQ25kVnc3Qmd3YlFuWHl5emlBQmNyc2pjaWNacFJ0SFJxSjJlWFlPa0lkak1JTW84OUMwUXlmLXM00gGcAUFVX3lxTE5jREw2WGhKNlJRZFBIVExaMjZ3MUFobGVKaFBvTF9OVVRTMlh1NVA0Szd0ZlN5Wk1XaERsNWxGYm9BOGRTa2N6ek5ZN0VnVWs0MUY5em1FTHB1LUV0RmYxN1J1b1ZOZVVVakRjRG9mZWlVelJ3OW5FaHpjSGN1cHNsR1Mza3hjdVVlbFZEU2g0SzV0LVFGbHZvc19adQ</guid></item><item><title>传染病更新2025年7月15日-每日科斯 | Infectious Updates 7/15/2025 - Daily Kos</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQX2FseHRINHBKRDh4WW84MVZDbGJwVFZKR2YtMlJiRHZ4OUNKQzNMU29XQmxxYmtYdXBjdUJkSkdWQ2UyZnNLTmVCUEJHNzNBdjE1ZTNuMkNMV3RjZVlsRmdmTDFZX3pwMVVybWRvdzgzNl8wOGc5TngySmZUUUdTTHFwQ0JSNVU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Kos</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 20:07:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxQX2FseHRINHBKRDh4WW84MVZDbGJwVFZKR2YtMlJiRHZ4OUNKQzNMU29XQmxxYmtYdXBjdUJkSkdWQ2UyZnNLTmVCUEJHNzNBdjE1ZTNuMkNMV3RjZVlsRmdmTDFZX3pwMVVybWRvdzgzNl8wOGc5TngySmZUUUdTTHFwQ0JSNVU</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.的牙齿怎么了？ - Slate Magazine | What’s Going On With RFK Jr.’s Teeth? - Slate Magazine</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxNZjFRbXhwWUxsbWt3SHZQeWlJSW1SdDlpbHhhRFYwZXI3dkVIRE9URzdFNm05YzBLcnZBYmZzbU5IWDcxdlBDX3pvcDEwTEpIa1NCdlNVbHlxdEdTTUhjcktHX0FURURXbjdVcGNpWmRGdE4wSHhpUkdWdVkzck9NYUxwOXFNQkswSXRnUjQzUTM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="103" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4t27hd00691dktf9c9yw1w@published"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the United States secretary of health and human services, has some strong opinions about teeth. Specifically, he seems to kind of hate fluoride, a mineral that, when added to the public drinking water in small amounts, can prevent dental decay. Despite what Kennedy claims, there are &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/01/fluoride-childrens-iq-study-pregnancy-science.html"&gt;no proven negative side effects&lt;/a&gt; of doing this. So far this year, Utah and Florida have banned fluoride in their drinking water, and a &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/05/16/fluoride-bans-states-florida-utah/83667361007/"&gt;slew of other states&lt;/a&gt; are considering doing the same. Without fluoride in the water, “you’re going to see probably slightly more cavities,” RFK Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/06/27/rfk-jr-fluoride-more-cavities-balance/84382999007/"&gt;recently admitted&lt;/a&gt; on Fox News.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpk001j3b775jw5nlhe@published"&gt;That cavalier attitude about a rise in cavities has upset a lot of dentists. Cavities aren’t trivial—they can result in a lot of pain. “Dental decay is a &lt;em&gt;disease&lt;/em&gt;,” Barry Taylor, executive director of Oregon Dental Association, told me. “Essentially, he’s saying: There will be more disease.” The American Dental Association “is very concerned for people of all ages and socioeconomic status” in communities stopping water fluoridation, a spokesperson wrote in an email. “People who suffer from untreated dental disease miss millions of school and work hours,” they added. So far, RFK Jr. is not looking great for America’s teeth.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpk001k3b77vzuh0y04@published"&gt;When Slate saw the above not-so-flattering image in a &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/insurers-wont-say-if-theyll-pay-for-childhood-vaccines-dropped-from-recommended-schedule/"&gt;recent Wired article&lt;/a&gt;, we had to wonder, &lt;a href="https://www.threads.com/@nicmonsees/post/DLnVWcwzJdA/what-is-even-happening-here-with-rfk-jrs-teeth-and-gums"&gt;as others&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/1lppwoz/what_the_hell_is_happening_in_rfk_jrs_mouth/"&gt;did&lt;/a&gt;, if Kennedy is not great for his &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; teeth. His mouth looks a little … grimy. Is it possible the man is against not just fluoride but also toothbrushes and floss? I called up a few dentists to see what they might make of his incisors. (Here, I’ll state the requisite caveat: It’s impossible to diagnose from a single photo and without a full dental workup.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="43" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpl001l3b772tc71rb3@published"&gt;There’s a lot to unpack. “The first thought is, he needs to brush his teeth,” Taylor said. “It may just be a picture that was taken after lunch, and he has a piece of Windsor clam or something in there, I don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="128" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpl001m3b77kaq4e30p@published"&gt;Other dentists were less sure about the wad of yellowish stuff stuck between his left front tooth and the tooth next to it. When I showed the picture to my own dentist, he thought it looked most like calculus—hardened plaque—though, he said, that usually forms across multiple teeth. Arosha Weerakoon, a professor in dentistry at the University of Queensland, in Australia, suggested that it could be something called Valplast, a type of flexible denture—perhaps that front tooth of his is fake. Though the consensus was that most if not all of RFK Jr.’s teeth look as if they are probably real, which is “pretty big for that age,” my dentist noted. (Kennedy is 71 years old, and most people have replaced at least a few teeth by then.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="141" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpl001n3b77tf2lmlcv@published"&gt;He got high marks for his gums too. There’s some darkening at the point where tooth meets gum, which indicates recession. But that happens naturally with aging, Weerakoon said, and at a glance, the extent of RFK Jr.’s recession appears to be in line with what you might expect at 71. Notably, his gums aren’t puffy, which would indicate gum disease. (Another controversial figure who likely &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have gum disease: Elon Musk. &lt;a href="https://dentalwiseturkey.com/elon-musk-teeth/"&gt;That puffy part by his front tooth&lt;/a&gt;? “It’s severely inflamed,” Weerakoon said. A slight touch to that area while speaking or eating, and “that’d be bleeding everywhere.”) Gum disease is &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21482-gum-periodontal-disease"&gt;most often caused by the buildup of plaque&lt;/a&gt;, which consists of bacteria that can infect the gums. Oral hygiene—especially brushing and flossing—is important to prevent gum disease. So Kennedy’s nice gums suggest that he may, generally, be a flosser.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpm001o3b77ysdxu7lv@published"&gt;There’s also the matter of the white strip on his top gum. Taylor suggested that it could be medical tape used to cover a surgical site. Weerakoon asked her dentist friends about it, and they came to a different conclusion: “It’s a Zyn.” That’s also what my own dentist thought. A friend and extracurricular Zyn expert whom I checked with concurred that it looks identical to the nicotine pouch that people push into their gums. It aligns, too, with public speculation back in January that RFK Jr. &lt;a href="https://people.com/rfk-jr-speculation-nicotine-pouch-confirmation-hearing-8783718"&gt;popped a Zyn&lt;/a&gt; during a confirmation hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="103" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpm001p3b77v01xq99j@published"&gt;Taken together, while the average person might recoil from this pic, it’s not damning of Kennedy’s dental hygiene. “If I was at a cocktail party, I’d be thinking, ‘decent teeth,’ ” said Taylor. “Just from that one picture, it appears that he has had good dental care in his life.” But what about the discoloring? Weerakoon notes that the slight difference between the two left teeth is likely due to a knock on the left tooth, which could have killed the tooth’s nerve. (I have the misfortune of an identical discoloring on the same exact tooth due to a slip on a rock.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="144" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpm001q3b77ax38ympe@published"&gt;The rest of the yellowing is a sign not of bad hygiene but of natural teeth “within a range of normal for that age,” Taylor said. All teeth yellow with time, and no amount of brushing and mouthwash can fix that—you’d have to have veneers or get bleach treatments, common choices for many Americans, particularly those in the &lt;a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2004/07/what-nice-teeth-the-democrats-have.html"&gt;public eye&lt;/a&gt;. Veneers are &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/why-does-everyone-in-hollywood-have-veneers-now"&gt;a norm in Hollywood now&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s even &lt;a href="https://www.hiltonheadcosmeticdentist.com/president-trump-wear-porcelain-veneers/"&gt;speculation&lt;/a&gt; that Donald Trump’s too-perfect teeth &lt;a href="https://www.bhdentists.com/blog/donald-trumps-smile-care-secrets/"&gt;are actually veneers&lt;/a&gt;. The interesting truth is that teeth don’t have to necessarily &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; good to be in good condition—in fact, natural teeth will almost certainly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; look “good” (i.e., white, spot-free, straight). So here I might throw RFK Jr. a bone: He’s not feeling any sort of pressure for his teeth to perfectly look the part. You could even say he’s helping to redefine dental beauty standards.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpm001r3b77c3a0zl5d@published"&gt;The fact that RFK Jr.’s teeth are largely in dentist-approved shape, though, is really the point. Although the fluoridation of public water that he opposes can benefit everyone, it’s consistently found to be most beneficial to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2834515"&gt;people with low incomes or who live in rural areas&lt;/a&gt;. There are other ways to get fluoride: toothpaste with fluoride or a professional fluoride treatment at your dentist’s office. And there are other important steps to keep your teeth in good shape and fight cavities: eating a healthy diet, brushing and flossing, regularly visiting the dentist. But all of these options require a certain level of access to resources, money, time, and health education.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="65" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpn001s3b77i61q9mp2@published"&gt;“RFK can afford any dentist anytime he wants to,” said Weerakoon. “So he can afford to go without water fluoridation.” For those who aren’t as fortunate, fluoridation is a great, inexpensive option to reduce cavities among all populations; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has given the process the distinction of being “&lt;a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/pcd/2015/04/23/community-water-fluoridation-one-of-the-10-greatest-public-health-achievements-of-the-20th-century/"&gt;one of the 10 greatest public health achievements of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpn001t3b77mnp979qy@published"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2834515"&gt;recent study projected&lt;/a&gt; that complete fluoridation removal from drinking water in the U.S. would lead to an increase of roughly 25.4 million cases of decayed teeth in children and cost approximately $9.8 billion over five years in health care expenses. Low-income communities will be hardest hit. Dental disease isn’t just a cavity here and there. It can cause millions of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/school-health-conditions/chronic/oral-health.html"&gt;missed school days&lt;/a&gt; among children; cost someone a job or create significant quality-of-life challenges due to social stigma; and, some research suggests, even result in complications such as &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/dental/art-20047475#:~:text=Some%20research%20suggests%20that%20heart,birth%20and%20low%20birth%20weight"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpn001u3b774t6aqse1@published"&gt;Kids, who cannot go out and buy fluoride toothpaste for themselves, will be particularly harmed by RFK Jr.’s anti-fluoride crusade. Weerakoon saw firsthand what could become more common in the States when working at a &lt;a href="https://www.health.qld.gov.au/public-health/industry-environment/environment-land-water/water/fluoridation"&gt;school in Queensland&lt;/a&gt; where many children were not drinking fluoridated water. She had a 4-year-old patient with so many holes in his teeth that he had to have all them removed. And yet, tooth decay &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/oral-health"&gt;is largely preventable&lt;/a&gt;. “We’re protecting those who are most vulnerable,” Weerakoon said, “that don’t have an opportunity to help &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;themselves.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;For generations, chicken soup has been &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002067.htm"&gt;a go-to remedy&lt;/a&gt; for people feeling under the weather. It holds a cherished place in many cultures as a comforting treatment for colds and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="167855" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But is there any real science behind the idea that soup can help us recover from respiratory infections?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside colleagues, I conducted a &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/13/2247"&gt;systematic review&lt;/a&gt; to explore this question, which examined the scientific evidence on the role of soup in managing acute respiratory tract infections, such as the common cold,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="167855" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="167855" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of more than 10,000 records, we identified four high-quality studies involving 342 participants. These studies tested a variety of soups, including &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/does-chicken-soup-really-help-when-youre-sick-a-nutrition-specialist-explains-whats-behind-the-beloved-comfort-food-213847"&gt;traditional chicken broth&lt;/a&gt;, barley soup, and herbal vegetable blends. While still early-stage, the evidence was promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/chicken-soup-has-been-a-remedy-for-thousands-of-years-but-why?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Chicken Soup Has Been a Remedy For Thousands of Years… But Why?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9391229/"&gt;One study found&lt;/a&gt; that people who ate soup recovered up to 2.5 days faster than those who didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms such as nasal congestion, sore throat and fatigue were milder. Some participants also showed reduced levels of &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/ageing-isnt-the-same-everywhere-why-inflammation-may-be-a-lifestyle-problem-260322"&gt;inflammation-related&lt;/a&gt; markers: substances in the blood that rise when the immune system is fighting an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, levels of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4176007/"&gt;IL-6&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha"&gt;TNF-α&lt;/a&gt; – two proteins that help trigger inflammation – were lower in those who consumed soup. This suggests that soup may help calm an overactive immune response, potentially making symptoms less severe and recovery more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, none of the studies examined how consuming soup influenced everyday outcomes of acute respiratory tract infections, such as whether people took fewer days off work or were less likely to end up in hospital. That's a major gap in the evidence, and one that future research needs to address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/can-chicken-soup-really-cure-body-and-soul-52357"&gt;are several reasons soup&lt;/a&gt; may help. It's warm, hydrating and &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/is-soup-healthy"&gt;typically nutrient-rich&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ingredients like garlic, onion, ginger and leafy greens have &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4267963/"&gt;anti-inflammatory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7402177/"&gt;antimicrobial&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8389214/"&gt;immune-supportive&lt;/a&gt; properties. The warmth can also help loosen mucus, soothe sore throats and promote overall comfort during illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167894" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167894" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/soup_when_sick_642.jpg" alt="woman eating soup" class="wp-image-167894 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/soup_when_sick_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/soup_when_sick_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167894" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Ancient wisdom sometimes persists for good reason. (GoodLifeStudio/Getty Images Signature/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Not just nourishment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also a strong cultural and behavioral aspect to food-based self-care: when people use food not just for nourishment, but as an intentional part of managing illness and promoting recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many households, food becomes medicine not only because of its ingredients, but because it symbolizes care, routine and reassurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My previous research found that &lt;a href="https://www.dovepress.com/parent-use-of-complementary-medicine-remedies-and-services-for-the-man-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-JMDH"&gt;parents, in particular&lt;/a&gt; often &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1744388120301900?via%3Dihub"&gt;turn to traditional remedies&lt;/a&gt;, like soup, as a first line of defense when illness strikes, often well before seeking professional medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reflects &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965229917309056?via%3Dihub"&gt;a growing interest in home remedies&lt;/a&gt; and the importance of culturally familiar treatments: remedies that feel safe, trusted and emotionally resonant because they're part of a person's upbringing or community norms. These kinds of treatments can increase confidence and comfort when self-managing illness at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food-based self-care may become increasingly important as pressure on healthcare systems continues to grow. With rising concerns about &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance"&gt;antimicrobial resistance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/33/11/738"&gt;overstretched services&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.576229/full"&gt;lingering trauma from global pandemics&lt;/a&gt;, simple, evidence-informed home treatments can play a crucial role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They help people manage mild illness, reduce unnecessary antibiotic use and avoid placing additional strain on GPs or &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/dec/31/big-rise-in-people-going-to-ae-in-england-for-minor-ailments-data-shows"&gt;emergency departments for minor ailments&lt;/a&gt; that can be safely treated at home. Even a simple phone &lt;a href="https://www.gponline.com/simple-phone-message-common-cold-cuts-gp-appointment-waits-21/article/1581517"&gt;message about the common cold&lt;/a&gt; – "Most common colds get better in a few days and don't need treatment from your GP" – has been shown to reduce appointment demand by 21 percent, highlighting how low-cost, home-based care could ease pressure across the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Local Government Association (LGA) &lt;a href="https://www.local.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/22.32%20-%20Self%20Care%20Publication_02.1_1WEB.pdf"&gt;reports that&lt;/a&gt; GPs handle approximately 57 million cases of minor conditions such as coughs and colds annually, costing the NHS over £2 billion a year. &lt;a href="https://www.local.gov.uk/topics/social-care-health-and-integration/role-councils-promoting-self-care"&gt;It argues that&lt;/a&gt; educating people about &lt;a href="https://www.pagb.co.uk/content/uploads/2024/01/PAGB-Self-Care-Survey-2023.pdf"&gt;effective self-care&lt;/a&gt; could help save GPs an hour a day on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Soup fits the bill&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So chicken soup is easy to prepare, affordable, safe for most people and widely recognized as a comforting, familiar home remedy for minor illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, our review highlighted a clear need for more research. Future studies could examine standardized soup recipes and investigate whether particular combinations of nutrients or herbs work best: does chicken soup have the same effect as barley broth or vegetable potage? Is there a difference if it's homemade versus canned?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as importantly, future research needs to measure meaningful outcomes: how quickly people return to work or school, how well they sleep during illness, how they rate their comfort and energy levels, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soup isn't a replacement for medicine. But alongside rest, fluids and paracetamol, it might offer a simple way to ease symptoms and help people feel better.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/260960/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Okra's health benefits definitely make it worth the effort.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brazilian researchers discovered that okra, a fuzzy green pod often overlooked in supermarkets, may help reduce body fat, improve blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and even protect vital organs like the liver f rom obesity-related damage &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In this animal trial, researchers worked with newborn rats, dividing them into two initial groups based on litter size to simulate different feeding conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first group included only three pups per mother - allowing them to have more access to milk and gain weight more rapidly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The other group followed a standard litter size of eight pups, creating more competition for milk and slower early growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At three weeks old, all rats were weaned and placed on one of two diets: a standard rodent diet or the same diet supplemented with 1.5 percent okra. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The form of the okra, whether fresh, powdered, or otherwise, was not specified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rats remained on their assigned diets until adulthood at 100 days old. Researchers tracked body weight, food and water intake, blood sugar, fat accumulation, and muscle mass every two days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also measured insulin sensitivity in both the body and brain, and analyzed inflammation markers in the hypothalamus, the brain region that regulates appetite and energy balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By adulthood, rats from small litters on a standard diet showed greater food consumption, higher blood sugar, and increased fat mass compared to the others, highlighting the metabolic risks tied to early-life overnutrition and the potential mitigating effects of okra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While human trials are still needed, scientists believe introducing okra early in life could offer protective health effects over time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rats that were overfed early in life showed clear signs of metabolic dysfunction, including insulin resistance, a key driver of Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, those same rats who were later placed on an okra-supplemented diet had lower blood sugar and cholesterol levels compared to those that didn’t receive okra, despite identical early-life overfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The small-litter rats on the okra diet also experienced slightly increased fat mass but showed gains in muscle mass, better glucose tolerance, and improved blood sugar control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Strikingly, their brains also exhibited reduced inflammation and responded to insulin administered directly into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was something not observed in the overfed rats on a standard diet, suggesting improved central insulin sensitivity, which plays a role in regulating hunger and energy balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In contrast, rats from standard-sized litters, whether on an okra diet or not, showed no significant differences in weight, blood sugar, fat accumulation, or brain inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This led researchers to conclude that okra's benefits may be most effective in those already at risk of obesity-related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While human trials have not yet been conducted, the researchers believe that compounds in okra, such as catechins, quercetin, and other phenolic antioxidants, may help counteract the long-term effects of early-life overnutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They noted that consuming excess calories during critical developmental windows, whether in animals or humans, can lead to lasting damage to the liver, heart, and brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Introducing antioxidant-rich foods like okra, they suggest, could be a simple and affordable strategy to reduce metabolic disease risk later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The fruit can be eaten raw in salads or salsa as well as cooked or roasted along other fruits and vegetables into various dishes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the scientists believe that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of okra can help fight against the damage caused by obesity, improve blood sugar levels and heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, previous research has shown that eating okras can also reduce the risk of developing colon cancer and improves bone health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Krasuna noted: 'Fiber also helps with blood sugar control. It works by slowing down the absorption of sugar and carbs. Okra is a great high-fiber food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'One-half cup of cooked okra provides more than 2 grams of fiber - nearly 10 percent of what adults need in a day.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, one-half cup of cooked okra also provides 32 micrograms of Vitamin K (essential for blood clotting and bone health), 14 milligrams of Vitamin C (supports the immune system and enhances iron absorption) as well as 37 micrograms of folate ( a crucial B vitamin essential for cell growth and division). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fruit can be eaten raw in salads or salsa as well as cooked or roasted along other fruits and vegetables into various dishes. The study was published in Brain Research earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 18:24:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxNeXJQd3hrWF9uZUd3WEUxb1N3WDFJYl9PZG9wRS13M205MkVjQmpBSE9Pdzl4cmV2dVNpVVFLZDNEMy1HTXJ0c0ppSm53OHVoN3dpbDZHaEFUcU9uNnJXdHBzd3hwbzNlRU40N0JBaFFnb2lFWjRySDBabnFKZmVnRlBOcG1YblJEVW92b292N01hRmk1em9iMWt2M0xTbEEwdVHSAacBQVVfeXFMTlJVX2J4VkNDVlRJWktsdGd1TFZXWGtDaG1BZ2NCd3owa19BVDZXMnlFbUhXb2g0YXYxWHJQOW9Ec3RLNm9sazUwdjZFS0lObUVlbEVocnJxZFlUcWFTUVVWOF85aHJuVkhrWWFOVTJQOG5kVHIxUXc2WmpROXJENWJjdFEtSFF5bExLSW9VWE9IVzdHdHpsekVwNFh0cC1vZ0RWbkNJQmM</guid></item><item><title>想随着年龄的增长提高你的大脑吗？音乐可能是答案- Medical Xpress | Want to boost your brain as you age?

These age-related changes in perception and cognition are often accompanied by increased neural activity and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/functional+connectivity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;functional connectivity&lt;/a&gt;—the statistical dependence of activity between different brain regions—in widely distributed neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recruitment of neural activity and strengthening of functional connectivity are thought to reflect a compensatory strategy employed by &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/older+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt; to maintain optimal cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positive lifestyle choices, such as musical training, higher levels of education, and bilingualism, contribute to cognitive and brain reserve, which represents the accumulation of cognitive and neural resources before the onset of age-related brain changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive Reserve Theory suggests that this reserve accrued through experience and training can help mitigate the impact of age-related brain decline, leading to better-than-expected cognitive performance. Yet how cumulative reserves influenced by positive lifestyle factors affect &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neural+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neural activity&lt;/a&gt; in older populations remains controversial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate this question, the researchers used &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/functional+magnetic+resonance/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;functional magnetic resonance&lt;/a&gt; imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity in 25 older musicians, 25 older non-musicians, and 24 young non-musicians who were asked to identify syllables masked by noise sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The researchers focused their analysis on neural responses within the auditory dorsal stream, which includes auditory, inferior parietal, dorsal frontal motor, and frontal motor areas, supporting sound-to-action mapping and sensorimotor integration during speech processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As predicted, the results revealed reduced age-related declines in speech-in-noise performance among older musicians compared to older non-musicians. During speech-in-noise perception, the older non-musicians showed the typical age-related compensatory increase in functional connectivity in auditory dorsal streams bilaterally (i.e., in both hemispheres of the brain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, older musicians exhibited a connectivity pattern in bilateral auditory dorsal streams that resembled young non-musicians, with connectivity strength in the right dorsal stream correlating with speech-in-noise perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, older musicians exhibited a more youth-like spatial pattern of functional connectivity during the task, whereas older non-musicians consistently showed a spatial pattern that deviated from young non-musicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these findings support the "Hold-Back Upregulation" hypothesis, which posits that cognitive reserve from musical training promotes a more youthful functional connectivity pattern, leading to superior behavioral outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond merely compensating for age-related declines, cognitive reserve may work by maintaining the integrity and functional architecture of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neural+networks/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neural networks&lt;/a&gt;, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of aging on cognitive performance. But due to the study design, it was not possible to determine cause-and-effect relationships between &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/musical+training/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;musical training&lt;/a&gt; and performance in the perception task.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;According to the authors, future studies should further test the "Hold-Back Upregulation" hypothesis using different cognitive tasks, such as memory and attention tasks, and investigate other sources of reserve, such as physical exercise and bilingualism. Eventually, these findings may inform interventions aimed at preserving cognitive function and improving communication outcomes in aging populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lei Zhang adds, "A positive lifestyle helps older adults cope better with cognitive aging, and it is never too late to take up, and stick with, a rewarding hobby such as learning an instrument."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Yi Du adds, "Just like a well-tuned instrument doesn't need to be played louder to be heard, the brains of older musicians stay finely tuned thanks to years of training. Our study shows that this musical experience builds &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+reserve/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive reserve&lt;/a&gt;, helping their brains avoid the usual age-related overexertion when trying to understand speech in noisy places."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life may unfold as a continuous stream, but our memories tell a different story. We do not recall the past as one long, unbroken text. Instead, we remember it as a series of meaningful events, like how sentences are structured with grammar and punctuation. Like any narrative, this organization gives our experiences shape and coherence, helping us make sense of what and when things happen.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The brain must devote a lot of space to this herculean task, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong! It turns out that a tiny but mighty region pulls far more than its weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a paper &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(25)00360-5" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Neuron&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/locus+coeruleus/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;locus coeruleus&lt;/a&gt;, acts like a "&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/memory/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; reset button" during meaningful changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our key question was: as an experience unfolds, how does the brain 'know' when one meaningful memory has ended and the next should begin?" said UCLA psychology professor and first author David Clewett. "Research has shown that remaining in a stable context, such as the same room, binds sequential experiences together in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By contrast, experiencing a shift in context, or event boundary, drives memories apart to represent distinct events. In this way, context acts as the grammar of human memory. What we found is that the locus coeruleus is most active at event boundaries when memories become separated. Thus, this small region at the core of the brain's arousal system may serve to punctuate our thoughts and memories."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clewett and co-authors Ringo Huang at UCLA and Lila Davachi at Columbia recruited 32 volunteers who looked at pictures of neutral objects while inside an MRI scanner. To manipulate whether the surrounding context was stable or changing, simple tones were played in either the right or left ear.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Eight pure tones were repeated in the same ear to create a sense of a coherent event, then the tone switched to the other ear and changed in pitch to elicit perception of an event boundary. This repeat-switch pattern continued throughout the remainder of the sequence, creating the perception of four different auditory events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then tested how these tone switches influenced memory. They reasoned that time provides a window into how events are formed: when people successfully reconstruct the order of a sequence, it suggests these items are linked within a single memory. In contrast, it is harder to remember the precise sequence of events when they have been stored in separate, distinct memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they predicted, locus coeruleus activation at event boundaries predicted later memory separation, as shown by worse ability to remember the order of item pairs that spanned boundaries. The researchers also cross-checked their measurements of locus coeruleus activation against eye pupil dilation measurements taken at the same time, because pupils are known to dilate slightly both as new events occur and when the locus coeruleus is active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These measurements confirmed that observations during the fMRI were indeed capturing activation in this small brain area. Functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow while a person is inside the scanner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequences of this neural and memory reset signal were far-reaching. Stronger locus coeruleus activation at boundaries between events predicted larger changes in activation patterns within the hippocampus, a brain region that tracks contextual details like place and time and is central to the formation of new memories.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"Part of the job of the hippocampus is to map the structure of our experiences, so it has an index of the beginning, middle and ends of events. We found that the locus coeruleus may provide the critical 'start' signal to the hippocampus, as if saying, 'Hey, we're in a new event now,'" said Davachi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Prior work had shown that bursts of locus coeruleus activity help reconfigure brain networks to direct attention to new and important experiences. Our findings suggest that this updating signal is even more widespread, also reaching memory-related regions that carry representations of ongoing events."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also examined how brief bursts of locus coeruleus activation are influenced by background levels of locus coeruleus activity. This matters because locus coeruleus neurons operate in two distinct modes: a burst-like mode that flags significant events and forms new memories, and a background mode that regulates general alertness and stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The locus coeruleus is like the brain's internal alarm system," Clewett said. "But under chronic stress, this system becomes overactive. The result is like living with a fire alarm that never stops ringing, making it difficult to notice when a real fire breaks out."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the dynamic interplay between these firing patterns has been studied in the context of decision-making, perception and learning, its relevance for how we perceive and remember events has, thus far, been unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the authors set out to test whether bursts of locus coeruleus activation at event boundaries, the neural signals that segment memories, might be weakened or lost under conditions of chronic stress. This question posed a challenge, as fMRI alone cannot measure absolute levels of stress or locus coeruleus activation. To address this, they used an imaging method that indirectly measures neuromelanin, a pigmented neurochemical that accumulates in the locus coeruleus with repeated activation over time.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;As predicted, participants with a higher neuromelanin-related signal, thought to indicate &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronic+stress/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronic stress&lt;/a&gt;, showed weaker pupil dilation responses to event boundaries. Stronger low-frequency fluctuations in locus coeruleus activation, a proxy for background levels of activity, also predicted weaker spikes in locus coeruleus activation and pupil responses to boundaries during the task. Together, these findings suggest that chronic hyperarousal may blunt one's sensitivity to change, disrupting the cues that anchor and organize new episodes in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identification of the locus coeruleus as the gateway or conductor for memory formation may lead to better ways to treat PTSD and other memory-related disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, where the locus coeruleus is unusually hyperactive. There are potential ways to quiet an overactive locus coeruleus, whether pharmacologically or through slow-paced breathing or even hand-squeezed stress balls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But good long-term solutions require further research and will take time to discover and bring to market. Perceiving events in the "right" way is directly linked to better memory, suggesting that improving locus coeruleus function is an effective target for either protecting or recovering memory function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Conducting basic science and clinical research is critical for opening new doors for treating debilitating disorders," Clewett said. "Recent legislative actions threaten this future, not only for scientific research but for breakthroughs that can improve the lives of patients and their families. It is perhaps ironic that at a time when legislation promises 'big and beautiful change,' it turns out one of the brain's smallest players may have the biggest impact on how we understand and remember our lives."&lt;/p&gt;

She picked her teeth constantly, a nervous habit, and in the absence of dental floss broke off the sharp silver teeth &lt;br&gt;of her comb and shoved the metal between her teeth. She refused to bathe. I found myself cataloguing all this, the many ways in which Alzheimer’s disease has ravaged her brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watching a parent transform into a toddler-like dependent who throws tantrums and can’t be left alone for more than five minutes is heartbreaking. But Heather Sandison, N.D., author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reversing-Alzheimers-Toolkit-Improve-Cognition/dp/0063339080?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10055.a.65207455%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Reversing Alzheimer’s;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Reversing Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;says it can also be highly motivating. As founder of &lt;a href="https://www.solcere.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Solcere;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Solcere&lt;/a&gt;, a brain-health clinic, and &lt;a href="https://www.maramaexperience.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Marama;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Marama&lt;/a&gt;, a residential memory-recovery facility in San Diego, Sandison has helped people ditch alcohol, get moving and adopt a brain-friendly diet after watching a loved one suffer from Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet according to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41591-024-03340-9&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhealth%2Fwellness%2Fa65207455%2Fwriting-letters-can-reduce-dementia-risk%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a study published in Nature Medicine;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;a study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the number of Americans who develop dementia each year will skyrocket from 514,000 in 2020 to 1 million in 2060 as baby boomers age. Plus, because women live longer, they have a 48% chance of developing dementia in their lifetimes compared with a 35% chance for men. It’s a safe bet that anyone who lives long enough will suffer from some form of memory loss. To prepare for this possibility, my husband and I have set up care plans (and set aside funds) so our adult children won’t have to make tough decisions on their own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;this simple act may protect your brain from dementia&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Power of the Pen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I was a little girl, I’ve been putting pen to paper to track my thoughts and feelings, set goals and make sense of the world. Apparently I’m in good company. Joan Didion famously said, “We tell ourselves stories in order to live.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond providing clarity and the opportunity for self-reflection, science suggests that writing by hand has brain-protective benefits. A &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1219945/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:January 2024 study published in Frontiers in;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;January 2024 study published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1219945/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Psychology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Psychology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reported that it activated more areas of the brain than typing and led to low-frequency synchronous brain waves in the back of the head (the visual cortex) via the sensory processing areas and all the way up to the top of the head (the motor cortex). “Such brain waves in exactly those parts of the brain are beneficial for learning and memory,” says study author &lt;a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/audrey.meer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Audrey van der Meer, Ph.D., M.Sc;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Audrey van der Meer, Ph.D., M.Sc&lt;/a&gt;., a professor of neuropsychology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another study, published in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5926989/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Journals of Gerontology in 2016;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Journals of Gerontology &lt;/em&gt;in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, reported that &lt;strong&gt;journal writing reduced the odds of all-cause dementia by more than 50%&lt;/strong&gt;. Additionally, the use of more complex language in the writing predicted a 25% reduction in risk of Alzheimer’s. “You use your body and senses to a larger extent when writing by hand versus typing, and the letters you draw on paper need to be precisely formed, which requires hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills,” says van der Meer. “All that is great stimulation for the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So as I watch my mom sink into the abyss of dementia, I’ve naturally turned to writing as a lifeline. On a recent family vacation, I wrote about what we ate, what we did and who we saw, hoping to capture details my future brain might struggle to recall. It struck me that I was in essence creating revivable memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, my catalogs of daily activities evolved into handwritten letters addressed to a “future me” —something tangible for my adult children to use as an “Instruction Manual for Mom” should I ever begin losing my mind. Each letter in the series acknowledges a harsh truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, you are in the throes of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;dementia. I imagine it’s a special kind of hell to be locked &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;inside a brain that can’t follow &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;simple instructions, one that &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;can’t make sense of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;anything happening in the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;moment. It’s natural to be scared, to act in ways that are &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;counter to who you are, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;and that’s why you need skilled &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;around-the-clock help. Your children may tell you &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;you’re &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;not a burden. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trust me, they are lying.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others address specific aspects of the disease:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I know you don’t think &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;you stink, but you do. I know the water may feel like pins and needles on your thinning skin, but you need to wash yourself with soap and water. Even if it’s just a sponge bath. You also need to wear deodorant. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sometimes you will think someone who is long dead is still alive. Other times you will think someone who is very &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;much alive has passed away. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s awkward. Uncomfortable. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sad. So sad. But people &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;understand that you will make &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;mistakes. People will &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;forgive you your ailing brain. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you balk at the callous nature of these letters, the ones that say "&lt;em&gt;Make no mistake, this isn’t going to get better&lt;/em&gt;," keep in mind that I’m also cataloging favorite memories. I’m taking note of simple moments in our lives, remembering my mom when she was in her prime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case in point: Once, while we were driving the boys home from school, my mom spontaneously belted out Barry Manilow’s “Copacabana.” My boys and I joined in, fudging the words in a sort of chorus gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to create a paper trail of who I am and who my mom was so that if I begin slipping away, my family will have something tangible to hold on to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Dizzying Toll of Alzheimer’s Disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is wildly unpredictable: One person with it may become combative, while another remains blissfully complacent. Unfortunately, no matter how Alzheimer’s presents, there are no effective medications for the advanced disease. The Food and Drug Administration has approved a few immunotherapy drugs for early-stage Alzheimer’s, but they require frequent IV infusions, can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and carry risks of complications, including brain swelling (um, no thank you!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These new treatments are groundbreaking in that they can remove some of the disease-related proteins from the brain, but they’re not a cure,” says&lt;a href="https://www.dementiaresearcher.nihr.ac.uk/profile-dr-jessica-z-k-caldwell-cleveland-clinic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jessica Z.K. Caldwell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; Jessica Z.K. Caldwell&lt;/a&gt;, Ph.D., director of the Women’s Alzheimer’s Movement Prevention and Research Center at Cleveland Clinic. “And while the studies show strong positive effects for white men, the sample sizes for women and people of color were too small to draw definitive conclusions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one can predict whether I’ll develop Alzheimer’s disease. Even on the rare chance that I carry two copies of the APOE4 gene — the strongest known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s — my odds of developing the disease can be modified by lifestyle changes. &lt;strong&gt;Experts estimate that nearly half of dementia cases, even those that are genetically linked, might be delayed or prevented with certain lifestyle and behavioral changes. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s never too early to implement changes that foster better brain health, but it can be too late. My mom’s situation, unfortunately, falls into the latter category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Road Map for the Future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time the cognitive changes of Alzheimer’s appear, the disease has been developing for decades. But much remains within our control, stresses Caldwell. In fact, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/abstract" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a 2024 report published in The Lancet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a 2024 report published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;linked 14 modifiable factors to reduced dementia risk — things like maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly and maintaining strong social connections&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to adopting such strategies, Caldwell says challenging your brain is critical: “If you’re coasting through life relying on devices instead of your own learning and memory, you’re missing an opportunity to strengthen neural circuits, grow new neurons and protect your brain.” With that in mind, I’m taking a proactive approach. Instead of consulting Siri for driving directions, calculations and random trivia, I’ve been using my head to come up with the answers (or doing the work to find them). I eat a diet rich in omega-3’s and blueberries. I exercise daily, meditate a few times each week and prioritize my oral health. And, of course, I write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no matter how much I prepare, I know there are no guarantees. That’s why my husband and I are open with our children about my mom’s decline — so they’ll understand what may lie ahead for us and how we hope they’ll navigate the disease should we follow the same path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope my boys will never have to give me the letters I’ve written; I hope that the steps I’m taking now will protect me over the long haul. But if things don’t work out in my favor, I view the written word as a prescription for healing — that of my children as much as my own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 17:46:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFBfRVJEX2d2S0dvQ0hfWmdibDJVX0NpSzNMR2IwSnpPVURjV0pCLVZrb3V4LTJFTmNack53c1BGYXlFaW1mQjRERGdoOEtPS29IOXRpVkVXdkdjaFJWQ0VfZF9ub2FHQ3RPQ3kxR2J3</guid></item><item><title>2025年，佛罗里达州有4人死于食肉细菌，其中包括一名圣约翰县居民- News4JAX | 4 people in Florida have died from a flesh-eating bacteria in 2025, including a St. Johns County resident - News4JAX</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi5AFBVV95cUxPSGNzYWZuX1JmME9IOTRpemI0VUtEb1JPb0FDNGlVdU5vZVg4R1psVUY2emVSRDBSa0ctWFhoMkYyaXdhaWRNbTQ5S2FYaGJaTjZjWTVzNWNFTHl4dVdMNTdoTDRPcUEwWnFWRlVEYkR2T3FNYlFTWnJpaXI5aXNUTWpiQ3FhMnJCYVA3b3pqWmJwbG93YWpNOExWQVhOXzRldktjZ09abmFJVXJjTVAtakdLdGVWeGdxNlNLeHNIQ0J3cTZ6RE1RMjhJb2dxcVdSTGJsc3Zfb3BESlV4QWt0eUQ3cTA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 fURyTV iQviKm articleBody" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ST.

So…which is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out, the answer depends on a few factors. So, we asked a gastroenterologist and a registered dietitian to weigh in. Here’s what you need to know about bananas and their effect on your digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts:&lt;/strong&gt; Valerie Agyeman, R.D.N., is a dietitian and founder of &lt;a href="http://www.flourishheights.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Flourish Heights;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Flourish Heights&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The fruit contains both soluble fiber, which helps soften stool, and insoluble fiber, which adds bulk and helps move waste through the intestines, says Valerie Agyeman, R.D.N., dietitian and founder of &lt;a href="http://www.flourishheights.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Flourish Heights;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Flourish Heights&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This combo of soluble and insoluble fiber can help get things moving without being too harsh on the digestive system,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bananas also provide potassium, a mineral that supports muscle contractions, including those in the digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How bananas may help relieve constipation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key reason bananas may help you go is thanks to their fiber content. And in some cases, it’s their resistant starch, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistant starch is a form of carbohydrate that bypasses digestion and feeds your beneficial gut bacteria, helping support the microbiome. Unripe bananas (the ones on the greener side) are a solid source of resistant starch, and early research suggests this type of starch may improve constipation symptoms by supporting gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2024 clinical trial in &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41598-024-79465-1&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffood-nutrition%2Fa65268799%2Fdo-bananas-help-you-poop%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scientific Reports;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; looked at resistant starch type‑3 (RS‑3), a form of starch found in unripe bananas, in adults with chronic constipation. Those who took RS‑3 daily for 12 weeks experienced a significant increase in bowel movement frequency and reported healthier stool consistency. They also saw improvements in their microbiome, specifically higher levels of beneficial bacteria strains, including Bifidobacterium and Akkermansia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While this study didn’t test bananas directly, it highlights how resistant starch, the same component in unripe bananas, can support gut regularity in adults,” says Mishal Reja, M.D., a gastroenterologist and medical advisor at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.beekeepersnaturals.com%2F%3Fview%3Dnewgroup1_index_1742835651678&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffood-nutrition%2Fa65268799%2Fdo-bananas-help-you-poop%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Beekeeper’s Naturals;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Beekeeper’s Naturals&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can bananas ever cause constipation?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There isn’t any evidence that suggests bananas can cause constipation. However, people with sensitive digestive systems (like those who have Irritable Bowel Syndrome) may react to bananas regardless of ripeness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In these individuals, even small amounts of fermentable sugars, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a19756314/fodmap-diet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:FODMAPs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;FODMAPs&lt;/a&gt; found in ripe bananas, can trigger symptoms like bloating, gas, abdominal pain, and changes in bowel habits, including diarrhea or constipation,” Dr. Reja says. “These symptoms occur because the sugars ferment in the gut and produce excess gas, which the digestive tract may struggle to handle effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since greener bananas have less fermentable sugars, they may be a better bet, but even these bananas can cause symptoms in certain people. If you experience symptoms after eating bananas or other similar foods, talk to your healthcare provider about next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Should you try bananas for constipation?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, one medium banana a day is a good place to start whether you’re dealing with constipation occasionally or regularly, Agyeman says. That said, it’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor before changing up your diet, especially if you’re on medications or have pre-existing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just make sure to stick to one banana a day (ideally on the greener side) and aim to hit your hydration goals. “Eating too many bananas without enough fluid or [a variety of] fiber in your diet could have the opposite effect and slow things down,” Agyeman says. “Fiber needs water to do its job, so combining them helps maximize digestion support.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can squeeze bananas into many different meals, but adding the fruit to your breakfast or a snack works well for consistency. And if you don’t love bananas plain, try blending one into a smoothie with Greek yogurt, a scoop of protein powder, and flaxseeds, or slice it onto whole-grain toast with almond butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What else can help with constipation?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, getting more fiber every day is a tried-and-true way to help prevent constipation. “Eating bananas in moderation can be fine, but they shouldn’t be relied on as a main source of fiber,” Dr. Reja says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get more fiber, Agyeman recommends chia pudding, kiwi, prunes, cooked leafy greens, and hydrating soups. “These foods are high in fiber and water, which is the ideal combo for supporting healthy digestion,” she reiterates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a supplement, be sure to talk to your doctor first. Dr. Reja recommends one that contains prebiotic fibers like chicory root, acacia fiber, and partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG), all of which support gut health without causing bloating in most people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your symptoms persist or seriously interfere with daily life, call your doctor as it might be time for over-the-counter help. Dr. Reja says that might include some of the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polyethylene glycol (PEG 3350, like Miralax): It draws water into the colon and softens stool. It’s well-tolerated, but shouldn’t be used long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psyllium husk (like Metamucil): A bulk-forming fiber that helps regulate bowel movements by adding structure to the stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium citrate: A quick-acting osmotic laxative that is good for short-term use, but shouldn’t be used regularly without guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senna (like Senokot): A stimulant that activates bowel movements. It might be helpful occasionally, but it’s not for daily or long-term use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If over-the-counter remedies stop being effective or if your constipation persists for more than a couple of weeks despite doing things like drinking more water and eating more fiber, it’s time to check in with a doctor again. Other signs that warrant a doctor’s visit include significant abdominal pain, unintended weight loss, blood in the stool, or a sudden and persistent change in bowel habits, Dr. Reja says. “These symptoms could indicate an underlying condition that requires further evaluation and testing,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bananas won’t act as a laxative, but their fiber and resistant starch content might help you stay regular in the long run. For most people, starting with one medium banana a day is a safe bet—go for a greener one if you tolerate it well, but stick with a riper banana if you have a sensitive stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Reja reminds us: “When it comes to digestion, consistency matters more than quick fixes.” That means staying hydrated, eating plenty of whole plant foods that are rich in fiber, and seeing a doctor if your constipation persists.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Catriona Reddin, senior study author and researcher at the University of Galway, said: 'This research represents a significant contribution to our understanding of how some diabetes medications may impact brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Diabetes is a known risk factor for dementia, but whether glucose-lowering therapies can help prevent cognitive decline has remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our findings suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonists, in particular, may have a protective effect on brain health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study comes after a similar experiment from the University of Florida, which tracked 400,000 Americans on glucose-lowering drugs and found dementia risk was 33 percent lower for GLP-1 users compared to other interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 8million adults in the US have some form of dementia, and 500,000 are diagnosed every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, one in eight US adults has reported taking Ozempic or similar medications at least once for diabetes or weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the new study, published in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2831975"&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/a&gt;, researchers identified 26 studies that explored the relationship between GLP-1 agonist use and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These included a total of 164,531 participants, most of whom (65 percent) were men. The average age was 64 with a follow-up time of 31 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Wendy Williams, pictured here, is one of the most famous faces of dementia. She was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in 2023 at age 59&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bruce Willis (pictured here) was also diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in 2023 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies included in the analysis were published between 2015 and 2024. Of the 26 in the review, 10 looked at the impact of GLP-1 agonists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team suspected GLP-1 agonists may lower inflammation, which is a major driver of dementia. It's thought to activate the immune cells microglia and astrocytes in the brain, which damage neurons and disrupt the blood-brain barrier, the brain's protective layer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;GLP-1 agonists have also been shown to lower blood pressure and protect blood vessels, reducing the risk of vascular dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thecardiologyadvisor.com/news/study-suggests-glp-1ras-may-reduce-dementia-risk/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;study published in April&lt;/a&gt; also found GLP-1s may stimulate neural growth in the hippocampus, an area of the brain responsible for learning and memory formation. However, this research is early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Martin O'Donnell, Dean of the College of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences at University of Galway: 'Given the increasing prevalence of both diabetes and dementia, findings from this study have important public health implications for prevention of dementia.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent reports from the Alzheimer's Association report rates of Alzheimer's disease - the most common form of dementia - &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14683527/alzheimers-rises-25th-years-people-diagnosed.html"&gt;have risen 25 years in a row in the US&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diabetes, meanwhile, affects 12 percent of Americans - 38million. Reports published in 2022 suggest rates in the Americas have tripled in the last 30 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations to the new study, mainly including a lack of data on subtypes of dementia like vascular and Lewy body dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 16:55:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxOcU4xck9vdmM3NnkzcVJ0c29qN3JvUDdzbGc3eXFBU3hlNDlkMnF2cnN5eFZ2LVk5Rm05azJyNzBvVzVtQTRVTWFpdXBfd0l1U09WM19abERkdmhENU1TOHgtV1QycUwtbGl2czR0bDhBWlo5SnRUSHFBVlpfc3JEb01IVERFVnNXYy1IZ0ZSODVIeEhuWnRYM0REY1F1d1BlemgzcHF30gGrAUFVX3lxTE5obWxHc2VOTF9CaVZFNXJsVTNlMXFXSHBPUEZjbmw1RW1xNlcwQjlveDZkSHkzSDV3ZUQyOUNMSUktXzBHQndNSkdBT2Q2b09tXzFlbnJFb1hVdGNpMVo3VThhazVIUFN5aGUzOUNSUElUNmVROG1ybXo5U01yLUotaXlHNUR6Z3duV3ZZQVdPYXk0NVV3SmltQkJkQkpWR1JLWWo3dU5pX0Z3bw</guid></item><item><title>医生忽略了我的舌头肿块......然后我忍受了我一生中“最病态”的经历-每日邮报 | Doctors ignored my tongue lump... then I endured the 'most morbid' experience of my life - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxQY0NCMlBiZHFwcW9HUTZVZTBDYmVGWVJrZEdtMW1CTFBNWGY0clJQMjFfLTN2RUJFZ3FjaEtLSnFmbjU1dTJjYXVCZW9Dd1VNdW5qeDIwMFRydGNlRm83WFByWG1NUjVaeWFndS0tMi1mQWgtRFBuRDdwUlh4TUpCbGlTWEhiUW9IR3FBMENjTWxjYlBjWmdnNV84Tmo1UlpvaTY3d9IBqgFBVV95cUxPdnZsTUhoWVVWUm16aENNUFNyLURUaFM5NWRKVlhOVElBd1dKdWFYcUVIaWd6anUtdTd0dlo3dEVLNl9vSmY0SFBMcF9qYi1lZkRxNjYtYzVWekQ0UlNRT1E1UUlrcS1SSm5YenFXZGFKcWhxZWRtRUhXbUpGaGRGV3VVUnhSVllzSF9EVkdHYUg2S29TZlFBdkMzZm1UbWtJYkJyYVFyWkdDdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Jamie Powell woke up one morning in late 2019 with a painful bump on her tongue, she assumed she had bitten it in her sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Random bumps on the tongue generally heal on their own within a few days, but the one on Powell’s stayed firm for two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Straining in front of a mirror to view her tongue in its entirety, Powell saw a protrusion of tissue, like a square stamp had traced the area perfectly. A bit farther back was the offending bump, large and nearly brushing the inside of her teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her dentist insisted that whatever it was, it &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14786545/Womans-mouth-cancer-deadly-common-infection.html"&gt;would go away with time&lt;/a&gt;. Thirty-six at the time, fit, healthy, and a nonsmoker, Powell was not a high risk for &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-f75ea270-618e-11f0-a87f-05a3c163b258"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. But weeks passed, and the bump remained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Powell went to an urgent care clinic in January 2020, where the doctor referred her to an ear, nose, and throat specialist, who performed a biopsy of the bump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A week went by in silence until Powell got the news that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14654813/Common-mouth-problem-warning-sign-cancer-tongue-removed.html"&gt;the bump was cancerous&lt;/a&gt;, and it had spread to her lymph nodes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her diagnosis kicked off what she considers to be the most 'morbid' period of her life, starting with a tongue resection surgery and 30 grueling radiation treatments that she often wished she could quit early because the pain was so great. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tongue cancer accounts for less than one percent of all new cancer cases in the US every year. Around 20,000 cases and 3,200 deaths are confirmed annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Thirty-six at the time, fit, healthy, and a nonsmoker, Jamie Powell was not a high risk for cancer. Neither she nor her dentist could believe that the obtrusive bump on the side of her tongue could be a cancerous mass&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the rate of deaths due to tongue cancer has remained about the same for about two decades, the patient profile of new cases of tongue cancer is beginning to shift from primarily older male smokers to women and younger healthy adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oral cancers usually spread quickly if left untreated, and Powell is confident that hers was allowed to grow unchecked when she was sent home from her dentist’s office over five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It was scary and frustrating not to know what was going on and not having anyone listen to me,’ she told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://people.com/cancer-survivor-reflects-on-life-five-years-after-tongue-surgery-11768664"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Powell had a section of her tongue surgically removed on March 23, 2020, just as Covid was getting its grip on the world. Doctors reconstructed it using tissue taken from her thigh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I remember the surgeon describing the surgery to me. I was just numb, and I heard him say that my voice will be different,’ she said. ‘I instantly thought of my kids. How will I sing to them? How will I tell them how much I love them?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She then had all of the lymph nodes removed on her left side to stop the spread of the cancer in its tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I couldn’t talk or eat. I had a feeding tube and I used my iPad to communicate to the doctors and nurses,’ Powell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also had to endure six weeks of radiation treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Powell had a section of her tongue surgically removed on March 23, 2020, just as Covid was getting its grip on the world&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With her head encased in a mesh mask that is bolted to a radiation table to ensure complete stillness, Powell suffered sunburn-like charred skin on her neck, blisters on her lips, and painful ulcers in her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Off the table, she was fatigued, nauseous, and had lost her sense of taste, so everything tasted of either wet cardboard or sewage. She also no longer had working salivary glands, resulting in a constant dry mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I’d rather do surgery every single day than go through head and neck radiation again,’ Jamie, now 41, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jamieraepowell/video/7060165809494281519"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She lost her ability to speak by week three of radiation, her mouth essentially one big canker sore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After surgery, she had to retrain her brain to form sounds and piece them into words. She still has trouble with words starting with ‘sh’ and ‘ch’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eating without salivary glands requires her to sip water after every bite. And if she has a dinner date with friends, she has to decide ahead of time whether she will eat or talk. She can no longer do both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At bedtime, she does not recline. Instead, she sits back as if in an airplane seat, propped against acupressure pillows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Think about when you’re sleeping and you wake up and your mouth is dry. I have that 24/7, and it’s heightened to the next exponent at night. So I have to sleep sitting up no matter what,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Radiation treatments led to irritated sun burned-like skin on her neck, sores in her mouth, and blisters around her lips&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And I wake up every hour from choking because of the dry mouth, so I take a drink of water, and I also have a spray bottle, and I will spray the inside of my mouth, like how you water your house plant.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every morning, at four am, she has to pry her jaw open with both hands and use the handle of a spoon to prop her mouth open so that she can stretch it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘For months after radiation, I couldn’t taste anything, then one morning I made my coffee and I could actually taste it - I cried,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Powell began documenting her experience on TikTok when she realized there were no other creators like her on the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tongue cancer is rare, but federal tracking indicates it is becoming more common. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rates of new cases have risen &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/tongue.html"&gt;about 49 percent&lt;/a&gt; since 1992, according to the National Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases are becoming increasingly common in women and young people, which scientists believe are tied to human papillomavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 70 percent of oropharyngeal cancers affecting the tonsils, base of the tongue, soft palate, and throat are linked to HPV, yet only 61 percent of US teens are fully vaccinated against the virus, which requires two or three doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The death rate due to tongue cancer has remained steady for decades, but case rates are ticking up in part, scientists believe, due to human papillomavirus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over 42 million Americans carry HPV, a virus that causes genital warts and cancers like cervical, throat, and anal malignancies, with 47,000 new HPV-related cancer cases diagnosed yearly. Despite this, public awareness of HPV’s cancer risks is declining, even as vaccination remains a critical defense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Most oral cancers are missed until it’s in the later stages,’ Powell said. ‘I’ve learned that no one should go through this alone. The more we talk about this cancer, the more help we can be to one another.’&lt;/p&gt;

It also broadcasts tiny timing shifts that doctors read as heart rate variability (HRV), a window into the balance of your autonomic nervous system (ANS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A five‑month field study now suggests those shifts rise and fall with patterns in space weather. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study makes a striking correlation between people’s HRV and energetic environmental phenomena such as the electromagnetic energy from the sun, the &lt;a href="https://www.heartmath.org/gci/gcms/live-data/gcms-magnetometer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Schumann resonance power&lt;/a&gt;, and energy influxes coming from outside our solar system,” said Rollin McCraty of the &lt;a href="https://www.heartmath.org/"&gt;HeartMath Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-solar-storms-spikes-heart-rate"&gt;Solar storms spikes heart rate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Abdullah Alabdulgader of the &lt;a href="https://www.hziegler.com/employers/prince-sultan-cardiac-center.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Prince Sultan Cardiac Center&lt;/a&gt; in Saudi Arabia led weekly 72‑hour ECG sessions for sixteen healthy volunteers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers matched each session against hourly logs of solar wind speed, sunspot counts, cosmic ray flux, and local geomagnetic indices collected by NASA and &lt;a href="https://www.sgo.fi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Finland’s Sodankylä Observatory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Increase in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/silent-storms-experts-identify-the-mysterious-source-of-solar-wind/"&gt;solar wind&lt;/a&gt; intensity was correlated with increases in heart rate, which we interpret as a biological stress response,” said Dr. Alabdulgader. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the wind strengthened, inter‑beat intervals shortened, hinting at a sympathetic spike even on calm clinical days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heart-variability-during-solar-storms"&gt;Heart variability during solar storms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart rate variability is commonly split into high‑frequency, low‑frequency, and very‑low‑frequency bands. The Saudi team saw all three bands climb when cosmic ray counts, solar radio flux, and local Schumann resonance power went up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cosmic rays seemed especially potent. Total HRV power rose for almost 40 hours after particle counts peaked. A European &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17338964/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; echoed this effect, linking higher cosmic rays to lower C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geomagnetic quiet was not always benign. A U.S. analysis of 263 cities found that disturbed fields, measured by Kp and Ap indices, coincided with increased cardiovascular deaths on the same day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-electromagnetic-fields-and-the-heart"&gt;Electromagnetic fields and the heart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why would charged particles millions of miles away nudge heart rhythms? One possibility is that they tweak the ionosphere, altering the ultra‑low‑frequency waves that bathe Earth’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists first noticed in the 1950s that the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26785376/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;primary Schumann&lt;/a&gt; peak near 7.83 Hz matches &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3507158/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;alpha brain oscillations&lt;/a&gt;. Modern EEG research shows brief real‑time coherence between Schumann power and cortical activity during geomagnetic spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These same frequencies overlap with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7560965/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;vagal signaling&lt;/a&gt; that drives the high‑frequency band of HRV. The Saudi dataset supports the idea that the heart, like the brain, can phase‑lock to natural electromagnetic cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-calm-waves-calmer-beats"&gt;Calm waves, calmer beats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schumann power rose during thunderstorms and quiet solar intervals alike. When this occurred, participants’ heart rates slowed and parasympathetic tone strengthened. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results mirrored a smaller trial in Japan that recorded lower blood pressure on strong Schumann days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboratory studies show that mammals and birds align circadian genes with weak radio‑frequency fields, though precise receptors remain debated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnetite nanoparticles in cardiac and neural tissue may act as primary sensors, while &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10966452/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;retinal cryptochromes&lt;/a&gt; could relay secondary signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-solar-storms-impact-heart-health"&gt;Solar storms impact heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, the effects are subtle, but population data suggest they are still significant. A global review conducted in 2023 showed that stronger overall geomagnetic fields were linked to slight increases in cardiovascular deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the horizontal part of the field appeared to have a protective effect – highlighting how geomagnetic exposure may influence health in complex ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians already use heart rate variability to flag autonomic imbalance in diabetes, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/meditation-can-rapidly-reduce-ptsd-without-revisiting-trauma/"&gt;PTSD&lt;/a&gt;, and post‑infection fatigue. If space weather can tip that balance, wearable monitors might one day combine cardiology and heliophysics to time workouts, surgeries, or even trading floors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every scientist is convinced. A National Institutes of Health panel recently referred to the current evidence as intriguing yet inconclusive, noting that lab replications with shielded chambers are still scarce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-emergency-planning-for-space-weather"&gt;Emergency planning for space weather&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/massive-geomagnetic-storm-reveals-earths-technological-vulnerabilities/"&gt;geomagnetic&lt;/a&gt; factors affect heart and nervous system activity – even subtly – then hospitals and emergency services may need to adjust staffing or readiness protocols during peak solar events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historical data already confirm that ER visits and psychiatric admissions spike during geomagnetic disturbances. People who are at risk from arrhythmia, hypertension, or mental illness may experience the strongest effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weather forecasts increasingly include space weather alerts, but medical infrastructure hasn’t caught up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors, paramedics, and health agencies could benefit from predictive models that track these environmental stressors and inform care delivery for vulnerable groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-further-research-is-needed"&gt;Further research is needed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Saudi volunteers were young, healthy, and living at low geomagnetic latitude. We do not yet know whether patients with arrhythmias, hypertension, or pacemakers react the same way at polar latitudes where field swings are stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dose matters too. Satellites warn of major solar storms days in advance, but subtle changes within the “quiet” range may fly below meteorological forecasts while still nudging sensitive physiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, correlation is not causation. Although animal studies shows pulsed fields can shift heart‑rate timing, the precise chain from ionospheric disturbance to vagus nerve firing remains only partially mapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies may include networks that monitor heart rate variability across multiple locations, along with magnetometers and possibly even &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-mapping-research-mouse-neurons-revolutionary-advance/"&gt;genetic screening&lt;/a&gt; for traits linked to magnetic sensitivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the evidence suggests we should consider space weather as one more environmental factor that may influence heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323016904_Long-Term_Study_of_Heart_Rate_Variability_Responses_to_Changes_in_the_Solar_and_Geomagnetic_Environment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 16:41:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE9pSkhwczJSd1d0bFVwa2xoUlo1MmpEZ0ZnWW1wcG51S0tuSE9IdDV1Rlo2S2lNQjQ2cjdXSUhROTZISE9aMkJJUVlXQ2JwSU5QOHRiRi1LQ2pXenFYd1Q1SFZDSkFqVGNMOGF6VExpeURTZGJjalJscl9wOA</guid></item><item><title>一些血液检查有望检测出癌症。须知事项。-《华盛顿邮报》 | Some blood tests promise to detect cancer.

Some doctors and medical practices are &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2024/cancer-blood-test-screening/"&gt;already using them&lt;/a&gt;, and the field has been propelled forward by innovation and hype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MAJXNMQ4NZAOVDMEBB5UO2R24E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Turning these innovative technologies into usable medical tools for the broader population has been complex. But a study recruiting subjects this summer, funded by the National Cancer Institute, seeks to begin to do that by answering basic questions about how the tests perform in comparison to more conventional cancer screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="YV2Z45NXYZELHJLBBYTJ5ANALY" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="YV2Z45NXYZELHJLBBYTJ5ANALY" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What will the study consider?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ECSK5LPSQBBWXNWOQOHQ5JOHSY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A screening test given to millions of healthy people has to be accurate to avoid costly and anxiety-inducing follow-ups. And for it to become part of routine medical care, there needs to be evidence that the test can reliably find cancers — perhaps far earlier than routine methods. Most importantly, scientists want to see clear evidence that earlier detection leads to longer lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QZH6ONEBMFCQBMF7JLGQZACUUQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To begin to fill this knowledge gap, scientists at nine sites around the country are recruiting up to 24,000 people between the ages of 45 and 75&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;for the &lt;a href="https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/institutes-networks-ircs/cancer-screening-research-network/the-vanguard-study.html"&gt;Vanguard Study&lt;/a&gt;. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either regular screening or one of two multi-cancer detection tests. All of the groups will be told to continue with regular cancer screenings and will be followed over two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XRX5WGWGIZFL7DZVFENIPK5KQI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The blood tests used in the study are made by Guardant Health and ClearNote Health. They&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;will screen for a variety of cancers, including many for which there aren’t more traditional screening tests: bladder, breast, colorectal, esophageal, stomach, liver, lung, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VZPVBKT5EFCVTFGVLZ6J6IJU7U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers, guided by what they learn from this first trial, hope to launch a much larger trial, with about 150,000 people, to definitively establish the effectiveness of these tests in preventing deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GIXSYZANJ5CZJAJCKNBIMPX4EU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Bert Vogelstein has been working on these ideas for 30 years at Johns Hopkins Medicine and is a scientific founder of Exact Sciences, a company working to make blood tests for cancer screenings, but is not involved in the new trial. He said the field is still in its adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M2N3UEEUQVE7TA2UU43HQ4FLMA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“But adolescents can do a lot of great things, that’s clear in athletics and it’s clear in science,” Vogelstein said. “I think what NCI is doing is great. And I applaud those efforts, because tests can do good or harm.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="VAV5MEDFLNCOPCBHRGG4ONWPWY" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="VAV5MEDFLNCOPCBHRGG4ONWPWY" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What are the benefits and harms?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6VUQB6PIYJFWLGXO3JWIHJY6L4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The benefit of early cancer detection is intuitive. People could roll up their sleeves and get a blood test to flag 20 cancers, allowing physicians to give early treatments when they have no symptoms. That could dramatically reduce the need for people to go through years of illness and advanced cancer treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WNLZ276BL5H3RLMB4GBRQXU7FI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“That dream, to me, is decades off, but we’re starting on it now — which is why it’s so exciting,” said Scott Ramsey, a physician and researcher at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center and a principal investigator with the Cancer Screening Research Network, which will be running the Vanguard Study. “We’re not talking about treating people who are sick; we’re talking about preventing people of dying in cancer in the first place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PGGHCYOL2NFE7IN7EG4AVPSKWQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The harms of screening are not always as clear to the public, but they show the trade-offs inherent when providing a medical intervention to healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BHSPCS5OERAAJARO2P4WAWD4J4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Ramsey pointed to the history around &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/government-task-force-discourages-routine-testing-for-prostate-cancer/2012/05/21/gIQAhFMFgU_story.html"&gt;prostate specific antigen (PSA) tests&lt;/a&gt;, which identified many prostate cancers early — some of which would have never shown symptoms or caused death. That meant that many men were aggressively treated, with surgery and radiation that caused them to be incontinent or impotent for years or decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IXQ65ALXOBDGTNPTZY55VI7TMU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The recommendations on how to test for prostate cancer changed as these trends became clear over decades. Ramsey said that now is the right moment to be subjecting these cancer blood tests to scrutiny. The potential for the tests is enormous, but there are fundamental questions that need to be answered about how and when they should be used — and, perhaps, when they shouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="PYFYLWDLWBD4XM4JIEBJ7DJ5E4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="PYFYLWDLWBD4XM4JIEBJ7DJ5E4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What needs to happen next?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="V6REZE437ZFLTN5WLTHUSI3TTI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The  recent study in &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerdiscovery/article-abstract/doi/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-25-0375/763427/Detection-of-Cancers-Three-Years-prior-to" target="_blank"&gt;Cancer Discovery&lt;/a&gt; illustrated one of the major problems facing the field. To detect cancers early, the tests need a big boost in sensitivity, because they need to find fragments of cancer tumor DNA that are scarce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BMRSOOFH7VDDDANMEETVBIYMTI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That study found that it was possible to detect cancer three or more years than a traditional diagnosis. “It can be done — and that’s an important part of the article, much earlier than had ever been shown before,” said Vogelstein, part of the team behind the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AT7BR2A24FCPFJ3SFAFA425BSA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But to detect those trace amounts of genetic material, the sensitivity of the test had to be roughly 50 times higher than what it is in tests today, he said — and would likely cost a few thousand dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WQT4VV5ZI5FP5BY6HBIONZU2HE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Ramsey said current tests can be $900 or more.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's common knowledge that obesity is a global epidemic, particularly in industrialized countries, and that it is a major cause of disease and poor overall health. However, there has been a tug-of-war in the debate of whether the main cause of obesity is diet or a lack of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Calories consumed must be expended as energy, whether through &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; or basal activity—the inherent processes within the body that use up energy, such as breathing or digesting food. When it comes to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/obesity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, it has been unclear if too many calories are being consumed on average to be used by normal activity or if there is not enough activity to expend a reasonable amount of calories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study, &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2420902122" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/i&gt;, focuses on the problem of diet vs. exercise. Amanda McGrosky and her team analyzed data from 4,213 adults, aged 18 to 60, across 34 populations in six continents. The sample is impressively diverse and covers people from hunter-gatherer groups, pastoralists, farmers, and industrialized societies. This includes people with a wide range of diets and activity levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined total &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/energy+expenditure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;energy expenditure&lt;/a&gt; (TEE), activity energy expenditure (AEE), basal energy expenditure (BEE) and two measures of obesity: body fat percentage and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/body+mass/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;body mass&lt;/a&gt; index (BMI). AEE is a representation of energy expended by exercise and was found by subtracting BEE from the TEE. The results were categorized into groups by the level of economic development, using the UN Human Development Index (HDI), due to the general lifestyle and dietary differences among groups at different levels of economic development.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The results initially found TEE, AEE and BEE to be higher in more developed populations, along with body mass, BMI and body fat, meaning obesity was more prevalent in more economically developed countries, but it appeared that they were also expending more energy overall. However, this is not the total picture.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledged that body size in general, like height, was overall larger in industrialized places. There are also fluctuations in weight and energy expenditure due to age and sex. The researchers further refined their data by adjusting for these factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results then showed that TEE and BEE decreased slightly, by around 6–11%, with economic development. After adjusting for age, sex and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/body+size/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;body size&lt;/a&gt;, AEE was still higher overall in more economically developed populations, indicating that it is not likely to be a lack of exercise that is causing higher BMI or body fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that total energy expenditure is only weakly associated with obesity, accounting for about 10% of the increased incidence of obesity in more economically developed countries. Instead, they indicate that a higher consumption of ultra processed foods (UPF), like processed meats, ready-made meals and snack cakes, is to blame, noting that "the percent of UPFs in the diet was positively correlated with body fat percentage."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite exercise not being the main driver of obesity, the study authors encourage regular &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/exercise/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;, as it is still known to be key in preventing disease and maintaining better mental health. The study also highlights the need for an emphasis on reducing calories from highly processed foods to help address the obesity crisis, but also to continue to study what makes certain foods lead to obesity, as UPFs appear to affect the body in unique ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They write, "The hyperpalatability, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/energy+density/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;energy density&lt;/a&gt;, nutrient composition, and appearance of UPF might disrupt satiety signaling and encourage overconsumption. Processing has also been shown to increase the percentage of calories consumed that are absorbed into the body rather than excreted."&lt;/p&gt;

BPD is as valid a diagnosis as schizophrenia or depression, which is to say that it is a well-studied clinical phenomenon that lacks biological markers. It has a coherent clinical presentation that differs from affective disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder (&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/topics/ptsd"&gt;PTSD&lt;/a&gt;), with a characteristic onset in adolescence and outcome in adulthood.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1,2&lt;/sup&gt; The term &lt;em&gt;borderline&lt;/em&gt; is a point of contention in the fields of psychiatry and psychology, with varying interpretations leading to an unstable—and occasionally confusing—delineation of its boundaries.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;3,4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;div class=" figure"&gt;&lt;div id="image-caption" class="text-gray-500 italic"&gt;&lt;div class="blockText_blockContent__TbCXh"&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIGURE. &lt;/strong&gt;Prevalence of Borderline Personality Disorder&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s in a Name?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Borderline is used to describe a borderline personality organization, based on Otto Kernberg, MD’s 1975 conceptualization, which is considerably more expansive than &lt;em&gt;DSM&lt;/em&gt;’s description of BPD.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; It is characterized by diffuse identity, predominant use of primitive defenses, and intact but fragile reality testing (ie, with the possibility of brief psychotic lapses in response to stressful situational events).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;In addition, borderline is used in reference to BPD, ie, to a specific clinical syndrome introduced to the &lt;em&gt;DSM&lt;/em&gt; in 1980 based on the pioneering work of John Gunderson, MD.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; It is characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affect, as well as marked impulsivity. BPD emerges during early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by 5 or more of the 9 criteria. BPD represents only approximately 10% to 25% of the patients who would be considered to have borderline personality organization.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Another interpretation of borderline places it as a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. This perspective gained traction in the 1960s and 1970s, emphasizing the proclivity of patients with borderline to experience transient psychotic episodes. Unlike those associated with &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/topics/schizophrenia"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, these episodes are typically brief, self-limiting, and triggered by situational stressors. Psychotic experiences may also be evidenced outside these discrete episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Borderline is also used to describe an affective spectrum disorder. The historical description of affective instability in borderline psychopathology has prompted some clinicians to hypothesize a correlation with mood pathology or even to consider borderline personality psychopathology as an attenuated variant of bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Borderline can be conceptualized as an impulse spectrum disorder because of the propensity for characteristic impulsive action. These are typically driven by an inner state (emotion or thought) that cannot be experienced at the level of inner experience, and that the patient feels the need to immediately express through action. Self-injury, suicide, substance abuse, and other risky behaviors are most concerning for clinicians, patients’ families, and social environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;A sixth potential interpretation is that BPD may represent a chronic form of PTSD. The significant correlation between traumatic experiences in early childhood and the subsequent development of psychopathology in adulthood has been well documented. The inclusion of BPD in the trauma spectrum gives primacy to the relationship with childhood traumatic events, attachment disorders, and defensive mechanisms that are predominantly dissociative in nature and put in place in response to trauma, and to the symptomatologic manifestations that are more likely to be traced to a traumatic genesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Borderline is also used as a catch-all category for any condition that does not fit neatly into the established nosographic patterns. The establishment of dichotomous categories within psychiatric nosology has been observed to give rise to the reappearance of hybrid clinical entities that disrupt the established nosographic patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Finally, borderline is used as a simplistic and inappropriate marker of failure, ie, when the clinician’s efforts are proved to be ineffective or unsuccessful (eg, admissions to services or psychotherapy pathways). This approach ignores the difficulties that patients with borderline may experience in forming relationships and the challenges that clinicians may face in managing and containing negative emotions (eg, hostility, anxiety, confusion, helplessness, and boredom), which are inherent to the intense and turbulent relationship with these patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;For these reasons, the patient with borderline represents a psychopathological figure in a state of perpetual suspension, traversing a series of positions and pathways whose significance can only be fully appreciated when viewed from an expanded perspective of individual episodes and the broader sequence of experiences and situations that shape the borderline condition. This fundamental aspect of borderline psychopathology renders it a true migrant within the field of mental health.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Essence of Borderline Psychopathology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;The construct of BPD is internally consistent and more homogeneous than is commonly assumed.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Thus, several theoretical models have been put forth to elucidate the core features that underpin the observed phenotypic heterogeneity.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1,3,6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Is there a psychopathological core that enables the clinical identification across theoretical models and perspectives? As early as the 1950s, Melitta Schmideberg, MD, posited that the defining characteristic of borderline psychopathology is its inherent instability, calling it “stable in its instability.”&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; This implies that the patient perceives instability as an inherent and fundamental aspect of their identity, establishing it as the bedrock of their own functioning. Consequently, this perception also influences the conceptualization of the pathology itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;But what does instability mean from a clinical point of view? A relational-affective vulnerability may be identified, which can be further delineated into 3 subdimensions: (1) a pronounced predisposition toward distrust and resentment toward others; (2) an inability to regulate one’s internal states and to tolerate and manage emotions, particularly negative ones; and (3) ineffectual attempts to cope with and express this distressing internal experience.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;These experiences are often rooted in distressing and traumatic events that occurred during childhood. They function as a catalyst for overreactions to situational events, particularly those involving interpersonal variables, in a dynamic relationship between past and present, which is mediated by protective and risk factors.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; This response reinforces the patient’s traumatic experience of contact with the external world, particularly with other individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;From this perspective, the array of borderline symptoms can be seen as an external manifestation of this relational-affective vulnerability; this interpersonal focus incorporates Gunderson’s seminal contribution to the understanding of borderline psychopathology.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The relational-affective vulnerability that is solicited by contingent stressful events results in the patient experiencing painful emotional states, which they attempt to escape. This is discerned by pursuing 2 distinct paths: one that is organizing and one that is disorganizing, with each culminating in disparate acute phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Anger and nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) are the most illustrative examples of organizing internal painful experiences. Anger serves to eliminate a source of irritation or pain, remove an obstacle to gratification, and restore a sense of autonomy in the face of highly frustrating situations.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;10,11&lt;/sup&gt; When anger is projected in the form of hostility, it temporarily rids the patient of these intolerable feelings about themself. Similarly, NSSI has the advantage of positioning negative emotions in a behavioral circuit that leads to a state of reduced tension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;In contrast, a state of disorganization and confusion about personal identity, corresponding to a series of painful experiences of emptiness, insubstantiality, and inauthenticity, is the most representative example of the failure of patients to organize painful internal experiences. When emptiness or aloneness is particularly intense, there may be an attempt to pursue an organizing path, often achieved through impulsive action, which provides a sense of cohesion and coherence to the self, restores a sense of vitality, and fosters hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;It can be said that BPD is fundamentally a disorder of paradox, in which the patient is trapped in a need-fear dilemma,&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;12,13&lt;/sup&gt; which is a simultaneous need for and fear of closeness with other persons. Thus, the patient teeters back and forth like a yo-yo in interpersonal relations,&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; placing the object in a classic double bind&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;: too far and the patient’s abandonment fears are triggered, too close and the patient responds masochistically by pushing the object away. This dynamic contributes to much of the interpersonal dysfunction observed in BPD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stigma and the Anti-BPD Movement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Patients and their caregivers/families frequently encounter structural stigma when accessing health services, resulting in poor health outcomes.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;16,17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Klein et al explored the international literature on structural stigma associated with BPD.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; The review highlighted 3 commonly held myths that continue to impede its understanding: (1) uncertainty about BPD as a legitimate mental illness; (2) concerns about disclosing a BPD diagnosis; and (3) the perception of BPD as an untreatable condition. Consequently, individuals are frequently denied evidence-based treatment and excluded from the health care system through a process of demedicalization.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;This notion has been reinforced in recent years by Roger Mulder, PhD, MBChB, and Peter Tyrer, FMedSci, who have argued that BPD has no place in clinical practice and that the diagnosis should be abandoned because it is inappropriately used, provides little information, creates confusion and uncertainty, and generates enormous stigma.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; The authors state that BPD has no basis in the scientific study of personality and is used indiscriminately to describe a range of negative interactions in human relationships that have causes far beyond personality function. Their paper has become a manifesto for an anti-BPD movement, which is part of a broader movement against modern psychiatry in the US. It is not within the scope of this paper to comment on the merits of this wider movement, which one of us has covered elsewhere.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;We argue that the anti-BPD movement can be dangerous for at least 2 reasons. Firstly, it contributes to the growing phenomenon of medical mistrust,&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; which has sometimes resulted in attacks on medical staff by patients or their families. Secondly, it is attracting an increasingly large group of patients (and their caregivers/families) who are angry (understandably) at mental health professionals because of repeated and frustrating experiences of malpractice. This process of channeling borderline anger forcibly addresses the organization of painful internal experiences previously discussed as essential to borderline functioning. However, it does not allow for the opportunity to work with these experiences in an appropriate and beneficial way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;The anti-BPD movement carries the risk of fueling mystification and chaos, as well as group defensive processes of splitting and projective identification. Borderline may be viewed as a witch to be burned at the stake, with clinicians who proffer this label becoming the perpetrators and those who proffer an antilabel becoming the saviors. There has been a proliferation of communities of angry patients on social networks that refer to the Mad in America website and exist to fight back against the pathologization and the use of labels. Such trends demonstrate en masse the very psychodynamics that characterize BPD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Can Really Help Patients?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;The pervasiveness of the stigma associated with BPD within health systems highlights the necessity for a comprehensive approach to addressing the underlying issues and implementing effective solutions. These issues extend beyond the realm of the BPD diagnosis; they pertain to the culture and delivery of health services and care.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;It can be—and has been—argued that renaming is not an effective solution to the negative beliefs and discrimination that are prevalent in society.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;9,22&lt;/sup&gt; Indeed, removing the borderline label would result in these patients being orphaned from a diagnostic framework, thereby compromising their access to evidence-based treatments. Renaming could potentially result in the obfuscation of the disorder’s complex and often challenging nature, which is relational in nature and manifests not only within the individual but also within the clinical relationship and even within the broader social reference community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Similarly, categorizing BPD as a form of trauma and reducing it to a description of childhood adversity is an inadequate approach to the condition.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; This fails to account for the complex developmental etiology and thus may reinforce victimization, failing to acknowledge the strong sense of agency that many patients possess.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;What, then, might be the most efficacious approach for assisting patients with BPD?&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1,3,18,19&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Firstly, clinicians must be provided with the requisite support in understanding the clinical complexity of the borderline condition, the role of situational interpersonal triggers (which are less well known than the impact of childhood traumas), the emotive burden associated with it, and the most effective treatments. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/topics/psychotherapy"&gt;Psychotherapy&lt;/a&gt; is the preferred treatment, whereas pharmacotherapy is recommended only for addressing discrete and severe comorbid disorders, such as severe depression or anxiety, or transient psychotic symptoms.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; Furthermore, pharmacotherapy should be administered for the shortest feasible duration and solely as a crisis intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Secondly, it is imperative to pursue further investigation into the disorder’s psychopathological core, which underlies the diversity of symptoms. This will facilitate a deeper comprehension of patients’ subjective experience. Research should be conducted on the developmental prodromes of adult-onset BPD, with particular attention to adolescence to facilitate the identification and treatment of high-risk clinical indicators for BPD before the disorder becomes disabling and thus challenging to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Thirdly, disseminating information about generalist models is essential. Clinicians should receive training in at least 1 generalist model that incorporates features of specialized evidence-based treatments (eg, Gunderson’s good psychiatric management).&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; Treatments can be conducted by experienced clinicians, even without formal training in the specific treatment modality. In the absence of evidence-based psychotherapeutic modalities, experienced clinicians may employ psychoeducation or crisis management; these are also beneficial for family members of patients with BPD, who bear a significant burden. The generalist approach also holds promise for early intervention for personality disorders among youth.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Ultimately, further measures are necessary to reduce the stigma. It is not uncommon for individuals to delay seeking assistance, and when they do seek assistance, they are frequently confronted with stigma regarding the nature and treatability of their disorder. Given the considerable advances made in research and clinical practice, this situation is no longer tolerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Finally, it is essential to promote and reinforce the efforts of the civil rights movement (as opposed to antidisorder movements) in defense of the fundamental rights of individuals experiencing mental distress: the right to life; the right to health, dignity, and citizenship; and the right to live in an inclusive and supportive community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prof D’Agostino&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;is an associate professor of clinical psychology at the University of Urbino Carlo Bo in Italy.

That 1949 letter, discovered during a 2023 digitization project in Bavaria, pointed curators toward a shoebox of lemon‑yellow fragments that had sat unnoticed for decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Roland-Eichhorn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Roland Eichhorn&lt;/a&gt; of the Bavarian State Office for the Environment (&lt;a href="https://www.stmuv.bayern.de/english/index.htm"&gt;LfU&lt;/a&gt;) led the modern hunt that followed, and his team soon realized they were staring at humboldtine, one of the &lt;a href="https://www.mindat.org/reference.php?id=13861544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;scarcest minerals&lt;/a&gt; on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-humboldtine-treasure-hunt"&gt;Humboldtine treasure hunt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archivists scanning shelves in Hof found the coal‑mine owner’s note and the tantalizing phrase: “Humboldtine from the Mathias mine near Schwandorf.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their curiosity sent Eichhorn’s crew rifling through more than 130,000 catalogued specimens stored beneath the LfU headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a small box, the team found hazelnut‑sized yellow fragments and a handwritten label that matched the location mentioned in the letter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the tag confirmed as authentic, Eichhorn and his team began a full investigation to determine if the samples were truly humboldtine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-makes-humboldtine-special"&gt;What makes humboldtine special&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/geologists-discover-three-new-mineral-specimens-in-southwestern-us/"&gt;mineral&lt;/a&gt; is an organic mineral, a rare class whose crystal lattice holds carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen bound to metals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humboldtine’s formula couples iron with oxalate, giving it a soft hardness of 1.5-2 and a resinous yellow sheen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectors prize it because it has been documented at only 30 localities worldwide, scattered across eight countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each discovery of the mineral seems like a fluke, happening when iron-rich rocks come into contact with certain natural acids in just the right damp conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mineral first surfaced in 1821, when Peruvian geologist &lt;a href="https://revistas.up.edu.pe/index.php/apuntes/article/view/780/917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mariano de Rivero&lt;/a&gt; named it for the Prussian explorer &lt;a href="https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/explore/alexander-von-humboldt/a-name-to-conjure-with" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alexander von Humboldt&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historians count roughly 400 species and minerals that now bear Humboldt’s name, more than for any other individual in science. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bavarian-brown-coal"&gt;Bavarian brown coal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bavarian nodules formed about eight feet below ground in a lignite seam that was mined during the mid‑20th century. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown coal is not an obvious birthplace for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0009281916300587" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;iron oxalate&lt;/a&gt; crystals. The reason these yellow nodules formed in the Schwandorf brown coal is still unknown and will likely never be fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mining ended years ago, leaving no fresh outcrops to analyze, yet the rediscovered lumps instantly doubled Germany’s documented reserve of the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-microscopic-mineral-ehrigite-discovered-could-revolutionize-geological-exploration/"&gt;mineral&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their size, each roughly the volume of a hazelnut, also dwarfs the millimeter‑scale grains typically reported from other sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-proving-it-s-humboldtine"&gt;Proving it’s humboldtine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back at the LfU laboratory, technicians ground a sliver and ran &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/x-ray-diffraction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;X‑ray diffraction&lt;/a&gt; on the powder. The diffractogram matched monoclinic humboldtine with textbook precision, ending any doubts raised by the old label. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another test showed the sample had the right mix of iron, carbon, oxygen, and water. Since it didn’t contain manganese, it couldn’t be mistaken for a similar mineral called lindbergite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are legally obligated to make geological collection pieces accessible to the public,” noted Eichhorn once the verdict came in. The verified samples will soon be displayed in the agency’s public gallery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-museum-drawer-to-lab"&gt;From museum drawer to lab&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond curiosity, humboldtine interests materials scientists because iron oxalates can shuttle electrons efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2019 study showed that a related oxalate compound stores charge through both iron and oxalate redox reactions, pointing to safer, high‑capacity cathodes for lithium‑ion batteries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2021 paper by &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paula-Vehmaanperae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Paula Vehmaanperä&lt;/a&gt; and colleagues went further, describing how humboldtine precipitates when oxalic acid dissolves hematite at modest temperatures, suggesting a low‑energy synthesis route. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineers now eye the mineral as a precursor for iron‑based battery anodes that avoid cobalt and nickel supply risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those industrial dreams hinge on reliable feedstocks, yet natural humboldtine remains vanishingly scarce. The Bavarian trove shows that museum drawers, not just mines, may hold the key to scaling future green technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-humboldt-s-legacy-in-modern-science"&gt;Humboldt’s legacy in modern science&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mineral’s namesake, Alexander von Humboldt, wasn’t just a collector, he shaped the way we understand Earth’s interconnected systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His approach to mapping botanical zones by climate and geography laid the foundation for modern environmental science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humboldt’s influence stretches from volcanology to climate research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By naming humboldtine after him, scientists honored a thinker whose curiosity bridged &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/water-and-ice-may-reveal-where-rare-earth-elements-are-hiding/"&gt;minerals&lt;/a&gt;, organisms, and entire ecosystems, an approach still shaping how today’s researchers connect geology with global change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-catalogues-still-matter"&gt;Why catalogues still matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digitising legacy collections can expose overlooked pages, mislabelled crates, and minerals that vanished from the field generations ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Schwandorf find underscores how systematic record‑keeping lets modern analysts revisit twentieth‑century fieldwork with twenty‑first-century tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As more agencies move their paper files online, Eichhorn predicts further surprises.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOUISVILLE, Ky. — A case of the &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-outbreak-central-kentucky-lexington/417-e2567188-2156-473b-b53c-4c63b5fa0f29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;measles &lt;/a&gt;has appeared in Jefferson County.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a news conference Tuesday, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said a child had traveled internationally to a country that has a measles outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first measles case to be confirmed in Jefferson County and the 13th case of measles in the Commonwealth in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norton Women's and Children's Hospital confirmed they saw the patient on July 12, and got the test results back late on July 14.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mayor said Louisville health officials are doing contact tracing to find who may have been in contact with them.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Public Health will tell those that they connect with through the contact tracing what to do, but there is a group of people who we will be asking to isolate," Greenberg said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mayor confirmed the case in Jefferson County is not related to the other active cases in the state; of those, 11 people were unvaccinated and one only person had one dose of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The health and safety of our community and residents are of my utmost importance,” Greenberg said. “Our team is working hard to prevent further spread in the community. I encourage everyone to check their vaccination status and get vaccinated if needed, as it is the most effective way to protect ourselves from this disease.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The child's vaccination status is currently unknown, according to health officials.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="isPasted"&gt;How do I know if I have measles?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus that can cause serious health complications, especially in young children. Measles is spread through the air and can remain suspended in the air for up to two hours. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early symptoms of measles begin eight to12 days after exposure and include high fever, cough, runny nose and red or watery eyes. The characteristic measles rash typically appears three to five days after symptoms begin, usually on the face before spreading down to the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Health Strategist Connie Mendel said Tuesday if you believe you have the measles to call the doctor's office ahead of time so they can make special arrangements to see you.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Measles vaccine&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first dose of measles vaccine is routinely administered in combination with mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) to children at age 12 months through 15 months, and a second dose at age 4 through 6. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two doses of MMR vaccine is 97% effective against measles, according to the CDC. CDC recently issued a travel advisory to urge all people traveling outside of the U.S. to receive two doses of MMR vaccine if they have never had measles. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, immunization rates among Kentucky’s kindergartners have declined.  Results from the most recent school immunizations survey for the 2024-2025 school year indicate that only 86.9% of Kentucky kindergarteners are fully vaccinated against measles, which is lower than the national average of 93%. Two doses of MMR vaccine are required for school attendance in Kentucky.  &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kentucky’s first confirmed measles case of 2025 occurred in an adult resident in February. The second case occurred in March in a child who was traveling through the Commonwealth when they sought treatment.  &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Copper isn't normally what comes to mind when talking about healthy eating, but a new study links copper in the diets of older adults to better cognitive function – a significant finding for research into &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coffee-could-be-the-secret-to-healthy-aging-for-women-scientists-discover"&gt;healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carried out by a team from Hebei Medical University in China, the study looked at diet and health data for 2,420 adults aged 60 or over in the US, finding there was a link between more copper in diets and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-4-key-factors-that-may-predict-cognitive-decline"&gt;better cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across multiple measures, those with more copper in their diets scored significantly higher than those with less – though there was also a threshold point above which more copper doesn't seem to bring additional benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/you-should-eat-more-of-these-8-healthy-foods-and-heres-why?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;8 Foods You Should Actually Eat More of: A Nutritionist Explains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The current study indicates a potential association between dietary copper intake and enhanced cognitive function in American older adults, particularly among those with a history of stroke," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-09280-9"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dose–response analysis suggested an optimal copper intake level, with an inflection point of approximately 1.22 milligrams per day. However, further longitudinal studies are necessary to confirm these findings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that gets at some key limitations of the study. Participants were asked to report everything they'd eaten in the last 24 hours, on two occasions, and the scientists estimated their copper intake from that. That only gives us a snapshot in time, and introduces potential biases from self-reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate further, studies would need to follow participants over several years, and measure their copper intake more carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, we can't say there's a direct &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"&gt;cause and effect&lt;/a&gt; relationship here. However, the relationship is statistically strong enough to warrant further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167687" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167687" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/CopperChart.jpg" alt="Copper analysis" class="wp-image-167687 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/CopperChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/CopperChart-600x387.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167687" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers charted copper intake against cognition test results. (Jia et al., &lt;em&gt;Sci. Rep.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, it fits with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-022-01802-5"&gt;earlier studies&lt;/a&gt; that came to the same conclusion: copper is good for the brain. We know that it helps &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2014.00143"&gt;neuron communication&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms232213850"&gt;energy production&lt;/a&gt; in the brain, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2008.09.039"&gt;protects against damage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, the study results aren't surprising. However, they do help quantify the benefits of copper across a relatively large group of older people, and several different &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-test-could-tell-if-you-have-early-signs-of-dementia-with-high-accuracy"&gt;cognitive tests&lt;/a&gt; – and identify a 'sweet spot' for copper intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Though copper is necessary for proper functioning of the brain, and deficiencies can lead to neurological disorders, excessive copper can be toxic, leading to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-09280-9"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1.22 mg per day is the equivalent of a handful of walnuts or a bowl of lentils. Copper is found in more foods &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/nutrition/copper-in-diet"&gt;than you might think&lt;/a&gt; – including mushrooms, dark chocolate, wheat bran, and oysters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15245116"&gt;an increasing amount of interest&lt;/a&gt; in micronutrients such as magnesium, iron, selenium, zinc, and copper, and how they might be important in keeping brains sharp as people enter the later years of their lives. This is on top of what studies have already discovered about &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-30-year-study-may-have-found-the-single-best-diet-for-healthy-aging"&gt;diets and healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly, what we eat &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-pinpointed-the-best-diets-to-boost-healthy-aging"&gt;plays a major role&lt;/a&gt; in how healthy our brains are – though diet is far from the only factor involved. Research like this can lead the way towards improvements in preventions and treatments for the brain problems that tend to come with old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the increase in the aging global aging population, the prevalence of cognitive impairment is also escalating," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-09280-9"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All forms of dementia, ranging from mild cognitive impairment to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="167684" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease, are marked by cognitive decline and are increasingly emerging as a significant global public health challenge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-09280-9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

NAD plus is a compound that naturally exists in your body and is responsible for keeping your skin looking youthful. However, as you age, its levels decrease, so it stands to reason that a supplement could help counteract that. Many people have taken to &lt;a target="_self" data-id="1cb5538c-653f-4fe5-8d5f-10900990eece" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/45PlusSkincare/comments/1h4u0km/has_anyone_tried_nad/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; to inquire about the potential skin care effects of this supplement, particularly for more mature skin. But will taking a NAD plus supplement actually make a difference in your skin and overall health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;No &lt;a target="_self" data-id="b2d4d030-ce4c-4208-85a7-79153a17ca86" href="https://www.cnet.com/health/biological-age-chronological-age-do-anti-aging-hacks-do-anything/"&gt;anti-aging method&lt;/a&gt; is foolproof, which is why we consulted doctors and experts to understand what exactly NAD plus is, how supplements can help the body's aging process and whether these supplements are safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="f5a64693-4cee-49c0-8063-81817a5cf533" data-cy="shortcodeListicle" data-id="listicle-f5a64693-4cee-49c0-8063-81817a5cf533" data-location="LIST" data-position="1" class="c-shortcodeListicle g-border-thin-light-top g-inner-spacing-bottom-medium g-inner-spacing-left-large g-inner-spacing-right-large g-inner-spacing-bottom-xlarge c-shortcodeListicle-notInfoCard g-outer-spacing-bottom-large g-border-thin-light-bottom g-border-thin-light-right g-border-thin-light-left"&gt; &lt;div class="c-shortcodeListicle_text"&gt;     &lt;div class="c-shortcodeListicle_dek c-shortcodeListicleDek c-shortcodeListicleDek-inline g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAD plus supplements may help improve cognitive function, boost energy and metabolism, support heart health and slow the aging process. Research is still limited and more is needed to understand the long-term effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="49f08103-a2b4-43c1-83fe-dd6a1924c06c" data-ng-block="{"&gt;What is NAD plus and what does it do in the body? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAD plus -- nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide -- is a coenzyme found in all living cells that keeps "everything running smoothly," explains &lt;a data-id="36018e2d-ad6f-46be-9907-e0ac6f84e2ec" href="https://www.facialartistrymd.com/" target="_self"&gt;Dr. Konstantin Vasyukevich&lt;/a&gt;, a New York-based facial plastic surgeon who often discusses aging with patients. It "creates energy and repairs DNA" and also regulates your circadian rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is also involved in the function of sirtuins, proteins that help regulate cell survival and aging processes," said Nayan Patel, a doctor of pharmacy and founder of &lt;a data-id="b98a82d9-b90a-4400-a2ce-7621d854550f" href="https://aurowellness.com/" target="_self"&gt;Auro Wellness&lt;/a&gt;. The coenzyme slightly differs from NADH, which you may also see while looking for NAD plus supplements. NAD plus is oxidized, while NADH is reduced, which basically means NAD plus has an extra electron and when it loses it, it becomes NADH.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAD plus is naturally found in the body, but as you age, your levels drop, which can lead to tiredness and skin aging, Vasyukevich says. An NAD plus supplement can help combat this, as can a vitamin B3 supplement. Although vitamin B3 is not the same as NAD plus, your body converts vitamin B3 into NAD plus, so these extra supplements can also help your NAD plus levels.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="38549039-8444-4991-9c45-77c7329c63a0" data-ng-block="{"&gt;NAD plus benefits &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary benefit of NAD plus, and, in turn, an NAD plus supplement, is that it's an energy booster. Studies -- including &lt;a target="_self" data-id="42ecc3fe-5411-44f8-a808-59060288463b" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10692436/"&gt;this one from 2023&lt;/a&gt; -- have shown that the coenzyme helps with weight management and balances metabolism, as pointed out by Vasyukevich. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[NAD plus] can do a few cool things," he says. "It can help with skin health by promoting DNA repair and fighting oxidative stress, which is a big reason skin ages. It can also give you more energy by helping your cells make more [adenosine triphosphate or ATP] -- that's the energy your body runs on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Daniel Llao Calvet/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="41f0d370-f007-4a34-910a-4a1c57dcc08e" data-ng-block="{"&gt;NAD plus side effects &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-id="021c9330-e0c6-4be3-926e-474eb0cf0d6e" href="https://www.medicalofficesofmanhattan.com/our-team/dr-jonathan-jennings/" target="_self"&gt;Dr. Jonathan Jennings&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified internist with Medical Offices of Manhattan and contributor to &lt;a data-id="021c9330-e0c6-4be3-926e-474eb0cf0d6e" href="https://www.labfinder.com" target="_self"&gt;Lab Finder&lt;/a&gt;, tells CNET that NAD plus supplements are mostly viewed as safe -- but as with any change to your health-care routine, you always want to approach with caution. Especially considering that the Food and Drug Administration does not regulate supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most data suggests all versions are safe in most populations and side effect profiles depend on the mode of supplementation," he says, noting that side effects for the supplement in pill form can differ from those when you take it intravenously, for example. "Common side effects include abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness and flushing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another common side effect, Vasyukevich says, is an interruption to your sleeping pattern. He says this can happen if you take the supplement too late in the day, which can generally be corrected by changing when you take it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both doctors, as well as Patel, recommend speaking with your health-care provider before starting an NAD plus supplement, as well as if you experience any side effects. If you experience any side effects, you should stop taking the supplement immediately. It may be interacting with another one of your medications or you may even have an allergy to it. You also may have an intolerance to it. This will be up to you and your doctor to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="942b3a2a-c682-4b5c-8e12-0cb67d00aeb1" data-ng-block="{"&gt;Who should avoid NAD plus supplements? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While NAD plus supplements are largely viewed as safe, Jennings cautions that they aren't for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is important to consult your health professional prior to supplementation because safety has not been confirmed for certain populations such as pregnant [people] and children," he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patel also recommends that people who are nursing avoid NAD plus supplements, as there's not enough research on these products. He also advises anyone interested in taking the supplement to discuss it with their doctor, as he wouldn't recommend it for people on certain medications or with specific medical conditions, although he did not specify which because that should be left up to each patient and their health-care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a data-id="9154310f-74d4-45c1-a6c0-56e73ed520ea" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/10/5/687" target="_self"&gt;2020 study&lt;/a&gt; showed, however, that NAD plus supplements could have adverse effects on those with existing liver or kidney problems because of how the supplement is metabolized. "Factors like age, genetic makeup, diet and health conditions can affect the body's response to supplementation," Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;RealPeopleGroup/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="9a579624-59ca-4a19-94cb-913e845a31f5" data-ng-block="{"&gt;Do NAD plus supplements actually work to slow down aging? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts and studies believe these supplements can positively affect people if used properly and at a dose recommended by a medical professional. Vasyukevich cautions, though, that they're not a "magic fix" to reverse the aging process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"NAD plus supplements can help by boosting the body's repair systems, which may reduce wrinkles and other signs of aging over time," he says. "They won't completely stop aging but they could help your cells stay healthier and function better, which might slow things down a little."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patel tells CNET that these supplements are still actively being studied. While some research shows that they can help improve the appearance of skin or give people more energy, he believes more clinical trials are "necessary" to fully establish efficacy in "aging prevention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also stresses that these supplements should never be used as a replacement for healthy habits, as those are some of the best ways to keep your body youthful as you continue to age. "Exercise, good nutrition, adequate sleep and &lt;a data-id="f053aeaf-f799-4ace-a304-96bc5e24d74e" href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/7-stress-relieving-tactics-that-will-help-you-reach-your-carefree-era/" target="_self"&gt;stress management&lt;/a&gt; are crucial for overall well-being," he says, adding that if you're going to try the supplements, take care in choosing them. They're not all equally effective and it's important to pick one that's high-quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="3143ebf2-0d8d-4080-876a-a2e2284d1af0" data-ng-block="{"&gt;NAD plus supplement dose and can you take it daily? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are different methods of supplementation which include oral, nasal, intramuscular and intravenous versions," Jennings said. Studies have been done on how supplements work in the body, although findings are limited.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patel tells CNET that nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide mononucleotide supplements have been studied and have been shown to improve the aging process but should be approached "with caution." Both types of supplements, also known as NAD plus precursors, are natural compounds that can &lt;a data-id="d5178451-7f28-4f01-af81-45bcb21e3700" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5842119/#:~:text=(A)%20Nicotinamide%20mononucleotide%20(NMN,are%20independent%20of%20catalytic%20activity." target="_self"&gt;enhance the production&lt;/a&gt; of NAD plus within the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a data-id="60e50af1-e2bc-408e-8784-e0660290be61" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10692436/#s17" target="_self"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; of nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide mononucleotide oral supplementation reported some improvement in "cardiovascular, metabolic and physical function" in those who participated. This study looked at several groups of people who had been given different doses of a supplement for various periods of time to analyze the efficacy and safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That being said, the dose that is right for you largely depends on what you discuss with your health-care provider. It also depends on the method you choose for supplementation. Most supplements in pill or nasal form can be taken daily but your doctor can advise you on what's best and adjust as needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Tetra Images/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a319ec0e-0d8f-4883-b126-8310c29ab0e2" data-ng-block="{"&gt;Other ways to increase NAD plus levels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking an NAD plus supplement isn't the only way to boost your body's NAD plus levels.

"Regular exercise has been shown to boost NAD plus levels by stimulating the production of NAD plus precursors," he says. "Additionally, lifestyle choices like adequate sleep hygiene and stress management can positively affect NAD plus levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you eat can also affect your NAD plus levels, especially if you reach for foods rich in vitamin B3 and niacin, which are precursors for NAD Plus (meaning the body turns them into NAD plus). Foods rich in vitamin B3 and niacin include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-ng-block="{" id&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beef&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Broccoli&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cabbage&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dairy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fish&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fruit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nuts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Peanuts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seeds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turkey&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole grains&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="aaf0df05-9bb7-4d46-a912-e987e50f01dc" data-ng-block="{"&gt;The bottom line &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we age, the body's naturally occurring coenzyme NAD plus decreases, leading to tiredness and skin aging.

It’s also crucial for normal cell growth and function. The &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Riboflavin-HealthProfessional/#h3" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recommended daily allowance;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;recommended daily allowance&lt;/a&gt; of riboflavin is 1.1 milligrams for most adult women (that jumps to 1.4 milligrams and 1.6 milligrams when you’re pregnant and breastfeeding, respectively), and 1.3 milligrams for most adult men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, if you’re consistently falling short of that amount, you may end up dealing with uncomfortable symptoms. Vitamin B2 isn’t a nutrient most people are familiar with, and it’s fair to be unclear on what the signs of a riboflavin deficiency actually are. Here’s what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the symptoms of low vitamin B2?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some symptoms of low vitamin B2 overlap with a slew of underlying health conditions, making it tricky to say for sure if you’re dealing with a vitamin B2 deficiency or something else. But if you notice one or several of these at once, it’s worth consulting a healthcare professional for a deeper dive into your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fatigue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cause of fatigue is an admittedly tough thing to pin down. Have you been working out too hard? Are you getting enough iron? Is your sleep off? Or is it your vitamin B2 levels? You can develop anemia, a condition where your body doesn’t have enough healthy red blood cells, when you have too-low levels of riboflavin over a longer period of time, according to the NIH. Among other things, that can make you feel weak and fatigued. But there’s another reason why a lack of riboflavin can make you feel tired, according to Keri Gans, R.D.N., dietitian and host of &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpodcasts.apple.com%2Fus%2Fpodcast%2Fthe-keri-report%2Fid1505586646&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffood-nutrition%2Fa65372376%2Fvitamin-b2-deficiency-symptoms%2F" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Keri Report podcast;cpos:12;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;The Keri Report podcast&lt;/a&gt;. “Riboflavin helps your body convert carbohydrates into fuel and plays a big role in how your cells produce energy,” she says. “Fatigue can happen when that process breaks down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cracked lips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, this may be due to something else, including not taking in enough liquids regularly. But cracked lips may also be a sign of low B2, according to Ife J. Rodney, M.D., a dermatologist and founding director of &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://eternaldermatology.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Eternal Dermatology + Aesthetics;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eternal Dermatology + Aesthetics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Riboflavin helps with moisture retention,” she says. If you’re low in the nutrient, your lips’ natural moisture can suffer as a result, leading to cracking and even bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crusty corners of the mouth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a more unique symptom of riboflavin deficiency, leading to lesions at the corners of your mouth. “You may get scaling or cracking in the corners of the mouth,” Dr. Rodney says. (This may even show up in the corners of your mouth and ears, she adds.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scaly patches on your skin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scaly patches can be a symptom of several skin conditions, but they may also be due to a lack of B2. “Riboflavin helps with tissue repair and cell turnover,” Dr. Rodney explains. “Any time you have issues with tissue repair or cell turnover, that’s when you get cracking or scaling.” These scaly patches will often look red or discolored from your usual skin color, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sore throat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riboflavin deficiency may cause swelling in your mouth and throat, making it feel like you have a sore throat, according to the NIH. “Since riboflavin is also crucial for overall cell function, low levels can affect fast-healing areas like the skin and mouth, leading to symptoms like a sore throat,” Gans says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unexplained hair loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;That cell turnover that can impact the health of your lips and skin may also affect your hair, Dr. Rodney says. When you don’t have enough riboflavin, it can impact the production of collagen, a type of protein that supports hair follicle (and skin) health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reproductive issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fertility is incredibly complicated, and it’s hard to say that adding more B2 to your diet will magically help you conceive. But not having enough riboflavin can interfere with several areas of reproduction, including the development of sperm and eggs, and ovulation, along with early development of the embryo, says &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://askdrgreves.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Christine Greves, M.D.;cpos:14;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christine Greves, M.D.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ob/gyn at the Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies in Orlando, Fla. (Worth noting: Many prenatal vitamins contain riboflavin.) Still, this isn’t usually a go-to solution for doctors when you’re struggling to conceive. “I don’t ask someone when they’re trying to get pregnant if they’re taking riboflavin,” Dr. Greves says. “But I do say that you should be having well-balanced meals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to tell if you have a vitamin B2 deficiency&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, if you suspect you might have a vitamin B2 deficiency, it’s important to see a healthcare provider for a proper evaluation. “A blood test is the gold standard,” says &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://jessicacordingnutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jessica Cording, R.D;cpos:15;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica Cording, R.D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;., author of &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/163228068X?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.65372376%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Little Book of Game-Changers;cpos:16;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Little Book of Game-Changers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;“This will give you information on how deficient you may be.” You and your healthcare provider can make decisions on next steps from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which foods are rich in vitamin B2?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few food sources of vitamin B2 to consider adding to your diet. According to the NIH, some of the biggest ones include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beef liver, 3 ounces, 2.9 milligrams&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortified breakfast cereals, 1 serving, 1.3 milligrams&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oats, 1 cup, 1.1 milligrams&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plain yogurt, 1 cup, 0.6 milligrams&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2% milk, 1 cup, 0.5 milligrams&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much B2 do I need?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;B2 recommendations vary slightly by age, sex, and life phase. Most genetic adult women need 1.1 milligrams a day of riboflavin, according to the NIH. However, those who are pregnant need 1.4 milligrams and those who are breastfeeding need 1.6 milligrams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most genetic adult men need 1.3 milligrams daily of riboflavin, per the NIH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I increase my B2 naturally?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding more B2-rich foods to your diet can help, Dr. Rodney says. “I recommend mostly focusing on your diet,” she says. If that doesn’t seem to help, she says a supplement may work—just consult a healthcare provider first about the proper dosing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin B2 risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few things that may happen when you take vitamin B2. “Some individuals experience digestive discomfort, nausea, or bloating,” says Scott Keatley, R.D., co-owner of &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://keatleymnt.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy;cpos:17;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (Taking it on an empty stomach may make this worse, he says.) Something else to consider, per Keatley: “Excess riboflavin can turn urine bright yellow, which is harmless but sometimes alarming.” That said, you’re likely to just pee out the riboflavin you don’t need. “B2 is a water-soluble vitamin, so excess amounts are typically excreted in urine,” Gans says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Cording stresses the importance of only taking a supplement under the guidance of a healthcare provider. “It’s the best way to go,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet. They are not medicines and are not intended to treat, diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or cure diseases. Be cautious about taking dietary supplements if you are pregnant or nursing. Also, be careful about giving supplements to a child, unless recommended by their healthcare provider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 14:00:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTFBjbV9WX3BkSEY3WW4za2V4Y05PTnkzekRoRHdrZnpSMTUteUQwU2dscUJuSWtod2paUmFHclJncTRkN2NDOXZFYm4zeWdtQ2UwYlFTYmRvZ002LVNwNVVvY0ZKZ1FTaFZDMDZr</guid></item><item><title>每天跑步5分钟可以延长3年的寿命- AOL.com | Running 5 minutes a day can add 3 years to your life - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE5DQUdKdEhDYVp3eHN5ZUZmVmRSN0hCX2FDLXppU09ubllzazVWRGhCQ3AxX1dkYWhRaGtIRzRveGhYTlFvTjhoQXpnRm94WlFWYVZVaHJqUC1DczVlbVlmYnJNaUNPUmhyZV9vdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;A couple running outdoors in the morning. - Ground Picture // Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Running 5 minutes a day can add 3 years to your life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running is one of the world’s most popular workouts, for good reason. It’s free, it’s simple, and it delivers near-instant payoffs: a better mood, a clear head, a calmer mind. But its biggest benefit may be one you won’t feel right away — a longer, healthier life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just five to 10 minutes a day of low-intensity running (think: a pace less than 6 mph) can extend your life expectancy by three years, compared with not running at all, &lt;a href="https://honehealth.com/mens/longevity/?utm_source=stacker&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=running-longevity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hone Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Hone Health&lt;/a&gt; reports.

The aorta, the body’s main artery, is especially prone to becoming less elastic. “Aortic stiffness is linked to hypertension and heart disease, says Knight. “Making the aorta more elastic again can ease the workload on the heart and improve blood flow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2019.10.045" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2020 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2020 study&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology suggests running can do just that. Researchers found that novice marathoners significantly reduced aortic stiffness and &lt;a href="https://honehealth.com/edge/does-trt-raise-blood-pressure/?utm_source=stacker&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=running-longevity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, effectively lowering their “arterial age” by about four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Essentially, months of &lt;a href="https://honehealth.com/edge/how-to-increase-vo2-max/?utm_source=stacker&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=running-longevity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:endurance training;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;endurance training&lt;/a&gt; produced benefits comparable to what we’d expect from certain blood pressure medications,” says Knight, “but achieved through exercise alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research puts a number on something experts have long suspected: “Consistent endurance training can &lt;a href="https://honehealth.com/edge/aging-backwards/?utm_source=stacker&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=running-longevity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:‘turn back the clock’ on your arteries;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;‘turn back the clock’ on your arteries&lt;/a&gt;, making your heart and vessels more youthful,” says Knight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduces chronic disease risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to cardiovascular benefits, running enhances &lt;a href="https://honehealth.com/edge/lower-blood-sugar-naturally/?utm_source=stacker&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=running-longevity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insulin sensitivity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;, lowering the risk of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. It also reduces the risk of major killers like stroke, diabetes, and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Regular exercise like &lt;a href="https://honehealth.com/edge/what-muscles-does-running-work-injury-prevention/?utm_source=stacker&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=running-longevity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:running;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;running&lt;/a&gt; is linked to better outcomes across the board,” Knight says. “Over the long term, these benefits translate into a significantly lower risk of premature death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you start your running routine, picking up the pace every once in a while could further slash your risk. &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/fulltext/2008/06000/vigorous_exercise,_fitness_and_incident.3.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:In a study of more than 41,000 runners;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;In a study of more than 41,000 runners&lt;/a&gt;, faster paces were associated with a lower prevalence of chronic health conditions, independent of total exercise volume and fitness level. For example, compared with the least fit men, the fittest men had a 62% reduction in the prevalence of hypertension, a 67% reduction in high cholesterol, and an 86% reduction in type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthens bones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running is a high-impact, weight-bearing activity — one of the best defenses against osteoporosis, a bone-weakening condition that affects one in two women and one in four men over the age of 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your bones react to the impact forces of running by becoming stronger and denser,” Knight explains. “It’s a classic ‘use it or lose it’ scenario.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She notes that regular running in early and midlife is an &lt;a href="https://honehealth.com/edge/anti-aging-foods/?utm_source=stacker&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=running-longevity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anti-aging strategy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;anti-aging strategy&lt;/a&gt; that helps build up a reserve of bone mass. Continuing to run slows the rate of bone loss that comes with aging. In older adults, even &lt;a href="https://honehealth.com/edge/best-exercise-for-menopause-belly/?utm_source=stacker&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=running-longevity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:slow jogging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;slow jogging&lt;/a&gt; or brisk walking can help preserve bone density and reduce the risk of fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case in point: A &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/46/6/1847/3902973?login=false" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study published in the International Journal of Epidemiology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;study published in the International Journal of Epidemiology&lt;/a&gt; found that just one to two minutes per day of running in pre-menopausal women and slow jogging in postmenopausal women is associated with better bone health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lubricates joints&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite what you may have heard, running won’t &lt;a href="https://honehealth.com/edge/menopause-and-joint-pain/?utm_source=stacker&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=running-longevity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:wreck your knees;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;wreck your knees&lt;/a&gt;.

Think again. Your body can adapt and improve its strength and aerobic capacity at any age. And if you’re looking for an all-in-one &lt;a href="https://honehealth.com/edge/8-longevity-habits/?utm_source=stacker&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=running-longevity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:longevity booster;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;longevity booster&lt;/a&gt;, running is a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While no one exercise can provide every aspect of fitness, running is definitely a strong contender,” says exercise physiologist Janet Hamilton. “It’s a natural movement, doesn’t require special equipment beyond a decent pair of shoes, and can be done most anywhere and at any time of day. It can be modulated to lower or higher intensity easily, so it can work the entire spectrum of cardiorespiratory fitness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re lacing up for the first time (or first time in a long time), here are a few of Hamilton’s top tips for making your running habit stick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respect the process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Start from where you are, not where you think you should be,” says Hamilton. “Building your fitness is a physiological process that takes place on a &lt;a href="https://honehealth.com/edge/mitochondria-longevity-aging/?utm_source=stacker&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=running-longevity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cellular level;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cellular level&lt;/a&gt;. You’re building all sorts of infrastructure to support what you want to do, and that stuff doesn’t happen overnight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re not currently running, start with a walking program, says Hamilton. Aim to build up to 10 miles a week without discomfort. Then, add short intervals of easy running — say, one minute of running followed by four minutes of walking. Do this for at least a week, and then gradually increase the run segments and decrease the walk segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people stay at the same ratio for a few weeks, and that’s totally fine, Hamilton says. “Don’t try to rush the process or you’ll end up injured.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invest in good shoes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Head to your local running store if you don’t know where to start. (Hint: If a shoe feels comfortable on your foot, it’s probably a good match.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Track your mileage and aim to replace your shoes every 300 to 500 miles or about every six months, depending on how often you run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stick with it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have to take a training break because of a family emergency or work commitment, &lt;a href="https://honehealth.com/edge/weight-loss-mindset/?utm_source=stacker&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=running-longevity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:don’t beat yourself up;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;don’t beat yourself up&lt;/a&gt;. “You don’t gain fitness overnight and you won’t lose it overnight,” Hamilton says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key, she says, is consistency over perfection. “You’re making an investment here, and much like the compound investing that comes with dividends being reinvested in your savings. The payout grows with time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://honehealth.com/edge/do-runners-live-longer/?utm_source=stacker&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=running-longevity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This story;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; was produced by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://honehealth.com/mens/longevity/?utm_source=stacker&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=running-longevity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hone Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hone Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and reviewed and distributed by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://hubs.la/Q03klgSR0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stacker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stacker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 13:51:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE5DQUdKdEhDYVp3eHN5ZUZmVmRSN0hCX2FDLXppU09ubllzazVWRGhCQ3AxX1dkYWhRaGtIRzRveGhYTlFvTjhoQXpnRm94WlFWYVZVaHJqUC1DczVlbVlmYnJNaUNPUmhyZV9vdw</guid></item><item><title>亚利桑那州男子在与蔓延到他大脑的严重山谷热作斗争后找到希望- ABC15亚利桑那州 | Arizona man finds hope after battling severe Valley Fever that spread to his brain - ABC15 Arizona</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxPamZvNlY0OG8yZ21MWlNibkdpS1gtVzZ3MHh5NjNXWHRWRkM1UUhHb2o3RmJWOTU2U0RqSzRFYWF2VG9UR0dLLWVnaHAtN1lEd09xaXNlajJ3Q1FmY2FDRGMya0gwNktWUHhoR0VEcUloSGhmV2J1em5sS2wySGpYOWRmU05yZ24tVFcyYkJBTkxNeV9aQVpmSkhFWG9XMFdxM3ZvbFV6UUhQR19vMjMxZG5OTWJOa28?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextArticleBody-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Phoenix resident is showing signs of improvement after years of treatment for a severe case of Valley Fever that spread to his brain, requiring specialized care at the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most Valley Fever cases present with mild symptoms similar to the common cold, Chris is among the small percentage of patients whose infection spreads beyond the lungs, creating life-threatening complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The spores spread to my brain, which made my condition much more complex and dangerous," Chris said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Marie Grill, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic who specializes in treating severe Valley Fever cases, has been overseeing Chris's treatment.

&lt;p&gt;Psilocybin, the main psychoactive ingredient in magic mushrooms, extends the lifespan of human cells, a lab study suggests. Researchers also found that the psychedelic compound slows certain hallmarks of aging in older mice while improving their fur quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, published July 8 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_8461513180531029056&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41514-025-00244-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fageing%2Fi-was-floored-by-the-data-psilocybin-shows-anti-aging-properties-in-early-study" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-025-00244-x" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41514-025-00244-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fageing%2Fi-was-floored-by-the-data-psilocybin-shows-anti-aging-properties-in-early-study" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;npj Aging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, provide the first experimental evidence of psilocybin's potential anti-aging properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The study provides a unique look at the potential of psychedelics to promote healthy aging and provides a provocative mechanism to explain how they do it," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/psychiatry/research/faculty-labs/laboratories-of-translational-psychiatry/scott-thompson" target="_blank" data-url="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/psychiatry/research/faculty-labs/laboratories-of-translational-psychiatry/scott-thompson" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Scott Thompson&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor in the University of Colorado Department of Psychiatry who was not involved in the research, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, "much additional work will be required to take these findings forward in a way that will reveal whether or not the findings are applicable and adaptable for human health," Thompson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, studies have explored psilocybin's therapeutic potential for treating various conditions, such as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10306375/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10306375/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;anxiety&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/385/bmj-2023-078084" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.bmj.com/content/385/bmj-2023-078084" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;depression&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and neurodegenerative disorders like &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11266071/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11266071/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The team found that the psilocin extended the lifespans of the cells by up to 57%, depending on the dose given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The psilocin also preserved the cells' telomere length and reduced levels of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/oxidative-stress" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/oxidative-stress" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or the buildup of reactive molecules. Simultaneously, it led to higher levels of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(13)00333-1?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1550413113003331%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(13)00333-1?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1550413113003331%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sirt1, a protein associated with longevity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;On the left, the old mice not given psilocybin are shown at two time points in the study.

(2025). npj Aging.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the psilocin made the cells appear like younger cells, Hecker told Live Science. Hecker's research involves looking at the impacts of aging on the body, and everything she knew to test for "just worked" she said. "I was floored by the data."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then went on to study the effects of psilocybin on approximately 19-month-old female mice — which, in human years, would be in their early 60s. The mice received monthly doses of psilocybin for 10 months. At the end of that period, 80% of the treated mice were still alive, compared with only 50% of an untreated group. The treated mice also displayed hair growth where they'd previously had bald spots, and their once-white hair grew back brown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's exciting that we can give this intervention in late life and have such a dramatic impact," Hecker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychedelics, in general, are known to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_1161023596451825621&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-08880-9&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fageing%2Fi-was-floored-by-the-data-psilocybin-shows-anti-aging-properties-in-early-study" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08880-9" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-08880-9&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fageing%2Fi-was-floored-by-the-data-psilocybin-shows-anti-aging-properties-in-early-study" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;alter the workings of the immune system&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the body's &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_8018116739315346023&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fnpp201784&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fageing%2Fi-was-floored-by-the-data-psilocybin-shows-anti-aging-properties-in-early-study" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/npp201784" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fnpp201784&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fageing%2Fi-was-floored-by-the-data-psilocybin-shows-anti-aging-properties-in-early-study" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;stress resilience&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, both of which can affect organ health, Thompson said. "What is new in this study is the provocative suggestion that changes in the length of telomeres — important regulators of DNA replication — may be produced by psychedelics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major limitation of the study is that the drug doses used in the lab mice are much higher than those typically administered to humans, Thompson said. That said, Hecker argues that this comparison doesn't consider the much faster metabolism of mice and the consequently shortened time the psychedelics are active in the animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings set the stage for investigating psilocybin as a treatment for aging and age-related diseases, Hecker said. Future research should investigate optimal doses to use in humans, as well as the potential risks, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-T6GCcrsWL4Rsi7MQpLg5wY-EMi4FcSAMnP74A0Pcp0ru5VHNn5kDBve" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-T6GCcrsWL4Rsi7MQpLg5wY-EMi4FcSAMnP74A0Pcp0ru5VHNn5kDBve slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest revolutions in the field of pain medication was the isolation of morphine from the opium poppy in the 19th century. Morphine molecules act as painkillers by attaching themselves to the µ-opioid receptor (MOR) in the central nervous system and blocking the brain from sending pain signals to the rest of the body. This potent opioid analgesic also has side effects such as constipation, respiratory depression, and even serious addiction problems.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;A new study &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2425438122" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/i&gt; has found that a single heavy atom replacement in the morphine core structure can transform its pharmacological behavior, resulting in reduced &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/respiratory+depression/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;respiratory depression&lt;/a&gt; and no evidence of reward behavior—a key component of addiction tendencies—even at high doses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the insight that core-atom changes to the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/opioid/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;opioid&lt;/a&gt; drug molecule may exhibit biological effects distinct from the parent compound, the researchers developed a 15-step total synthesis of a morphine derivative where an oxygen atom in the E-ring is replaced with a methylene (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) group and called the new derivative carbamorphine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opioid-abuse epidemic, also known as the opioid crisis, is a major concern worldwide as its repercussions go beyond health implications. The addictive nature of opioids affects &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(23)00131-X/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;60 million people worldwide&lt;/a&gt;, with overdose deaths exceeding 100,000 each year, especially from fentanyl, an opioid 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. The side effects of overuse can also creep into one's social life, often leading to difficulty in maintaining relationships and employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;With this ongoing opioid crisis, designing morphine-like MOR compounds that relieve pain without causing addiction or breathing problems is a major goal in pain research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key interaction that helps morphine activate the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/opioid+receptor/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;opioid receptor&lt;/a&gt; is a hydrogen bond between the oxygen atom in its dihydrofuran ring and a tyrosine residue in the receptor.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For nearly two centuries, morphine derivatives like codeine, heroin, and naloxone were developed by making peripheral modifications to the molecule's structure and not the core E-ring oxygen atom. Analogs like levorphanol and dextrorphan that did make changes to the core atom also included other structural changes, making it difficult to pinpoint the impact of removing just a single atom on the morphine-receptor interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To study the role of this bond, the team replaced the core E-ring oxygen with a carbon by introducing a methylene group, a swap that removed the hydrogen bond but kept the molecule's overall size and shape almost identical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers used cell-based assays to measure how well the molecules bound to and activated the opioid receptor. They found that the carbamorphine molecule showed MOR activity in both enantiomeric forms—two molecules with the same molecular formula and structure but arranged differently—unlike &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/morphine/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;morphine&lt;/a&gt;, which has only one enantiomer that is opioid-active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;They also conducted studies in mice to assess the behavioral and physiological effects of the derivative. The results revealed that carbamorphine provided effective pain relief, significantly reduced slow and shallow breathing behavior, and, most importantly, the drug did not show conditioned place preference (CPP)—a behavioral procedure used to assess the rewarding effects of drugs— even at higher doses, indicating a reduced potential for abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight how subtle atomic changes can significantly alter a drug's interaction with its receptor and its effects in the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that derivatives of opioids that focus on core atom modification could unlock a new generation of safer opioid drugs with more desirable properties.&lt;/p&gt;

But it’s widespread among those of us in wealthy, highly industrialized nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="P45HQEDIIVBRVJH5FJAJYAXUEY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Why? A major study published this week in PNAS brings surprising clarity to that question. Using objective data about metabolic rates and energy expenditure among more than 4,000 men and women living in dozens of nations across a broad spectrum of socioeconomic conditions, the &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2420902122" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; quantified how many &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/06/13/weight-loss-calories-fiber-microbiome/" target="_blank"&gt;calories&lt;/a&gt; people from different cultures burn most days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="S2JSS34NC5HNLISIYVJPB43HPM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For decades, common wisdom and public health messaging have assumed that people in highly developed nations, like the United States, are relatively sedentary and burn far fewer daily calories than people in less-industrialized countries, greatly increasing the risk for obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IRP2RC32SRAGXK5LLLG3VZJ34Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the new study says no. Instead, it finds that Americans, Europeans and people living in other developed nations expend about the same number of total calories most days as hunter-gatherers, herders, subsistence farmers, foragers and anyone else living in less-industrialized nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CS4OXHEVDZB2LLIE4AUGR5XKDM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That unexpected finding almost certainly means inactivity is not the main cause of obesity in the U.S. and elsewhere, said Herman Pontzer, a professor of evolutionary anthropology and global health at Duke University in North Carolina and a senior author of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LGRUTP3EWVEOPCDMSW2PMGV7SU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;What is, then? The study offers provocative hints about the role of diet and some of the specific foods we eat, as well as about the limits of exercise, and the best ways, in the long run, to avoid and treat obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="6G63EE4UA5DXPJOUJ7M57W5Y4E" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="6G63EE4UA5DXPJOUJ7M57W5Y4E" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Is diet or inactivity causing obesity?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BII7HAIURNB7DAJJNSR6EODF3Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“There’s still a lively debate in public health about the role of diet and activity” in the development of obesity, Pontzer said, especially in wealthy nations. Some experts believe we’re exercising too little, others that we’re eating too much, and still more that the two contribute almost equally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BNEABTOQ7BBSTPCTXUKOYPHKN4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Understanding the relative contributions of diet and physical activity is important, Pontzer noted, because we can’t effectively&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;help people with&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;obesity unless we first tease out its origins. But few large-scale studies have carefully compared energy expenditure among populations prone to obesity against those more resistant to it, which would be a first step toward figuring out what drives weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GNTTM2UDAJEGPDZNILDLIOXPII" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So, for the new study, Pontzer and his 80-plus co-authors gathered existing data from labs around the world that use doubly labeled water in metabolism studies. Doubly labeled water contains isotopes that, when excreted in urine or other fluids, allow researchers to precisely determine someone’s energy expenditure, metabolic rates and body-fat percentage. It’s the gold standard in this kind of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5P55V2GFCBCY5JRB5D5SD7VR7A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;They wound up with data for 4,213 men and women from 34 countries or cultural groups, running the socioeconomic gamut from tribes in Africa to executives in Norway. They calculated total daily energy expenditures for everyone, along with their basal energy expenditure, which is the number of calories our bodies burn during basic, biological operations, and physical activity energy expenditure, which is how many calories we use while moving around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="2JRDQXWJ7JD57OGZDNHHB6C32Q" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="2JRDQXWJ7JD57OGZDNHHB6C32Q" data-testid="article-header"&gt;A new theory of how our metabolisms work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OBEP74FI4VD5TBYSK53VAYTJTM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After adjusting for body size (since people in wealthy nations tend to have larger bodies, and larger bodies burn more calories), they started comparing different groups. Anyone expecting a wide range of energy expenditures, with hunter-gatherers and farmer-herders at the high end and deskbound American office workers trailing well behind, would be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NYO7IDQC6NFI5OBLZEMAQK5PGI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Across the board, the total daily energy expenditures of the 4,213 people were quite similar, no matter where they lived or how they spent their lives. Although the hunter-gatherers and other similar groups moved around far more throughout the day than a typical American, their overall daily calorie burns were nearly the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="P4ZYVXOA3VFSTC3YGNXWUU2IG4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The findings, though counterintuitive, align with a new theory about our metabolisms, first proposed by Pontzer. Known as the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/11/27/exercise-weight-loss-science/" target="_blank"&gt;constrained total energy expenditure model&lt;/a&gt;, it says that our brains and bodies closely monitor our total energy expenditure, keeping it within a narrow range. If we start consistently burning extra calories by, for instance, stalking prey on foot for days or training for a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/10/25/marathon-recovery-strategies/" target="_blank"&gt;marathon&lt;/a&gt;, our brains slow down or shut off some tangential biological operations, often related to growth, and our overall daily calorie burn stays within a consistent band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="XR4EMZRYDZGBTIUE4ONKBN6XRI" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="XR4EMZRYDZGBTIUE4ONKBN6XRI" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The role of ultra-processed foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VSB6HMTR5FF3ZB75TADEACRSS4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The upshot is that “there is no effect of economic development on size-adjusted physical activity expenditure,” Pontzer says. In which case, the fundamental problem isn’t that we’re moving too little, meaning more exercise is unlikely to reduce obesity much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HPZAFSQZEZGIFC7RIBWNNRHDQA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;What could, then? “Our analyses suggest that increased energy intake has been roughly 10 times more important than declining total energy expenditure in driving the modern obesity crisis,” the study authors write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C4X7HE3ITNCZTE2VHSGYSABJEY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In other words, we’re eating too much. We may also be eating the wrong kinds of foods, the study also suggests. In a sub-analysis of the diets of some of the groups from both highly and less-developed nations, the scientists found a strong correlation between the percentage of daily diets that consists of “&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/09/27/ultraprocessed-foods/" target="_blank"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;” — which the study’s authors define as “industrial formulations of five or more ingredients” — and higher body-fat percentages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SUVHEFBD6ZALBFQU7TUXF6PFYA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;We are, to be blunt, eating too much and probably eating too much of the wrong foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BSNVP6FXZRCT5JCPRFNUQZU7UM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“This study confirms what I’ve been saying, which is that diet is the key culprit in our current [obesity] epidemic,” said Barry Popkin, a professor at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and an obesity expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MNZ26ZHS5FFAVDYNL2MZGMDRG4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“This is a well-done study,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BSRFBAZKCBBRTEJI7RNNZ7K6ZA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Other experts agree. “It’s clear from this important new research and other studies that changes to our food, not our activity, are the dominant drivers of obesity,” said Dariush Mozaffarian, director of the Food is Medicine Institute at Tufts University in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WDATWET4ORFG3ASVWJWFFOSOG4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The findings don’t mean, though, that exercise is unimportant, Pontzer emphasized. “We know that exercise is essential for health.

But this ancient threat is still very much a danger in our modern world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to research published in 2022, the bacterium that causes typhoid fever is evolving extensive drug resistance, and is rapidly replacing strains that aren't resistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, antibiotics are the only way to effectively treat typhoid, which is caused by the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/em&gt; serovar Typhi (S Typhi). Yet over the past three decades, the bacterium's resistance to oral antibiotics has been growing and spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their study, researchers sequenced the genomes of 3,489 S Typhi strains contracted from 2014 to 2019 in Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India, and found a rise in extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Typhi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XDR Typhi is not only impervious to frontline antibiotics, like ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, but it is also &lt;a href="https://www.coalitionagainsttyphoid.org/the-issues/drug-resistant-typhoid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;growing resistant&lt;/a&gt; to newer antibiotics, like fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/forgotten-antibiotic-from-decades-past-could-be-a-superbug-killer?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Forgotten Antibiotic From Decades Past Could Be a Superbug Killer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even worse, these strains are spreading globally at a rapid rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While most XDR Typhi cases stem from south Asia, researchers have identified nearly 200 instances of international spread since 1990.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_146183" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-146183" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/SalmonellaTyphiFlagellarStain.jpg" alt="salmonella typhi picture" class="wp-image-146183 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/SalmonellaTyphiFlagellarStain.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/SalmonellaTyphiFlagellarStain-600x333.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-146183" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Salmonella Typhi.

In 2016, the first XDR typhoid strain was identified in Pakistan. By 2019, it had become the dominant genotype in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, most XDR typhoid strains have been fought with third-generation antimicrobials, like quinolones, cephalosporins, and macrolides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But by the early 2000s, mutations that confer resistance to quinolones accounted for more than 85 percent of all cases in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Singapore. At the same time, cephalosporin resistance was also taking over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href="https://www.coalitionagainsttyphoid.org/the-issues/drug-resistant-typhoid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;only one oral antibiotic is left&lt;/a&gt;: the macrolide, azithromycin. And this medicine might not work for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2022 study &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(22)00093-3/fulltext#seccestitle10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; mutations that confer resistance to azithromycin are now also spreading, "threatening the efficacy of all oral antimicrobials for typhoid treatment". While these mutations have not yet been adopted by XDR S Typhi, if they are, we are in serious trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If untreated, up to 20 percent of typhoid cases can be fatal, and today, there are 11 million cases of typhoid a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future outbreaks can be prevented to some extent with typhoid conjugate vaccines, but if access to these shots is not expanded globally, the world could soon have another health crisis on its hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The recent emergence of XDR and azithromycin-resistant S Typhi creates greater urgency for rapidly expanding prevention measures, including use of typhoid conjugate vaccines in typhoid-endemic countries," the authors &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(22)00093-3/fulltext#seccestitle10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Such measures are needed in countries where antimicrobial resistance prevalence among S Typhi isolates is currently high, but given the propensity for international spread, should not be restricted to such settings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Asia might be the main hub for typhoid fever, accounting for 70 percent of all cases, but if  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="167902" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; taught us anything, it is that disease variants in our modern, globalized world are easily spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent that from happening, health experts argue nations must expand access to typhoid vaccines and invest in new antibiotic research. One recent &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X21007131" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in India, for instance, estimates that if children are vaccinated against typhoid in urban areas, it could prevent up to 36 percent of typhoid cases and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakistan is currently leading the way on this front. It was the first nation in the world to offer routine immunization for typhoid. Health experts argue more nations need to follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antibiotic resistance is one of &lt;a href="the-third-leading-cause-of-death-globally-in-2019-was-antibiotic-resistant-bacterial-infection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the world's leading causes of death&lt;/a&gt;, claiming the lives of more people than  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hiv" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73049" data-postid="167902" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt;/ &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hiv" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73049" data-postid="167902" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt; or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/malaria" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73073" data-postid="167902" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt;.

This is also true for some smaller public health departments. The CDC didn’t immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not knowing exactly what COVID cases look like in your area is unnerving, especially as more people start to get sick this summer. Below, experts explain why the tracking is off and what COVID is looking like this summer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COVID data from the CDC isn’t too accurate right now, and that’s for a number of reasons.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID tracking data from the CDC used to be a reliable way to look up COVID case numbers and hospitalizations in your area, but that isn’t the case anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since COVID lost its public health emergency designation status, “some of those tools and resources that we relied on for data are no longer being used,” said &lt;a href="https://www.elisabethmarnikphd.com/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Elisabeth Marnik" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68750aebe4b00af0c5f268a4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.elisabethmarnikphd.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Elisabeth Marnik&lt;/a&gt;, a scientist and science communicator based in Maine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hospitals also aren’t required to report their COVID data to the CDC anymore, Marnik noted. This is one reason cases may appear to be lower than they really are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, some people, including some medical professionals, don’t look at COVID as a summer problem, said&lt;a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/emily-landon" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" Dr. Emily Landon" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68750aebe4b00af0c5f268a4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/emily-landon" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt; Dr. Emily Landon&lt;/a&gt;, the executive medical director of Infection Prevention and Control at UChicago Medicine. This could mean less COVID testing in the summer, which means fewer COVID cases reported to hospitals and public health departments, Landon explained. And this could also make cases appear to be lower than they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But what doesn’t help that at all is the way the federal government, the new administration, is treating COVID as though it doesn’t exist,” Landon added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration put an end to&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/trump-administration-axes-covid-funding-state-community-health-departments" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" COVID funding" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68750aebe4b00af0c5f268a4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/trump-administration-axes-covid-funding-state-community-health-departments" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt; COVID funding&lt;/a&gt; for state and local health departments, as well as the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, certain health departments don’t have enough funding to properly track COVID infections in their area or to send their data on to the CDC, Landon explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The less funding there is for COVID and for public health in general, the less testing and sequencing and forwarding on of data, data collection and data aggregation,” Landon added. This also makes COVID cases appear to be lower than they actually are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We just don’t have as much data as we had a year ago or even a couple years ago when we were in that public health emergency,” Marnik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wastewater data is a good way to track COVID infections in your area, but it is still not a total picture.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if someone chooses not to test and brushes off a COVID infection as a “cold,” wastewater data can indicate when there are high levels of COVID in an area. Wastewater data tracks infections in sewers from toilets, showers and sinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While wastewater data, once again, isn’t as reliable as it once was, you can look at the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="CDC’s COVID wastewater data" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68750aebe4b00af0c5f268a4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;CDC’s COVID wastewater data&lt;/a&gt; dashboard to see how infection levels are in your area, said &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/1821/suruchi-sood" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Suruchi Sood" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68750aebe4b00af0c5f268a4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/1821/suruchi-sood" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Suruchi Sood&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also have a tool that I like better called &lt;a href="https://www.wastewaterscan.org/en" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="wastewaterscan.org" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68750aebe4b00af0c5f268a4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.wastewaterscan.org/en" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;wastewaterscan.org&lt;/a&gt;,” Marnik added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, right now, when I look at the data, the CDC page is saying COVID-19 levels are low in wastewater, whereas Wastewater Scan has been kind of toggling between high and medium,” Marnik noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, I think that kind of also shows that there’s some discrepancy between the data that the CDC has access to and the data that Wastewater Scan has access to,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither have a complete look at the country, she added, but both still give helpful information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also look at your local and state public health departments, which may have data on COVID cases in your region, Marnik said. As mentioned above, not all of these departments have enough funding to track this data, but you can check and see if it’s a good resource for your area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this information can help you stay safe from a COVID infection. For instance, if you know cases are high in your town, you can take additional precautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Guido Mieth via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Guido Mieth via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;To protect yourself from COVID this summer, gather outside when possible and improve indoor circulation when not.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But, COVID cases &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; increasing in many parts of the U.S.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Historically, if we look at all the past summers, we have had a summer spike,” Marnik noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC wastewater data, there’s a COVID increase in Florida and Alabama, Sood said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you look at Wastewater Scan right now, we’re starting to see that the West Coast has high levels of SARS-CoV-2 detected in wastewater,” Marnik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also the case for the Northeast. “Whereas the Midwest area has low levels,” Marnik added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, it’s not unreasonable to think we likely will also be having a summer spike now, and the Wastewater Scan data ... because we’re starting to see higher rates in some areas of the country, indicates that we might be also heading for that summer spike,” Marnik added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, it’s impossible to predict how high of a spike we’ll have, noted Marnik.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;At UChicago Medicine, Landon said they’re seeing more COVID this week than last, and more employees are sick with COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, of course, doesn’t account for the folks who aren’t going to the hospital for COVID, so there is even more COVID out there, said Landon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nimbus COVID variant, or NB.1.8.1, is the &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="dominant variant " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68750aebe4b00af0c5f268a4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;dominant variant &lt;/a&gt;in the U.S., meaning it makes up the majority of cases right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been seeing it increasing for the last few weeks,” Landon noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;NB.1.8.1 could potentially “contribute to a summer wave,” Marnik said. “But ... we really just have to wait and see what it ends up looking like.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a peek into what COVID &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; look like in the U.S. this summer, experts look to the U.K. The U.S. tends to follow the U.K.’s COVID-19 patterns, Sood added&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They were seeing an increased amount of COVID-19, the Nimbus strain, but luckily, it actually wasn’t really strongly associated with a lot of hospitalizations,” Sood said. “So, all of that, to me is really quite reassuring.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID levels also weren’t as high as they were in previous summers in the U.K., Marnik noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases in the U.K. are starting to go down, Sood added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.K. tends to have higher rates of COVID vaccination than the U.S., though, Marnik said. This could mean fewer infections in the U.K. as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So it’s really hard to know how we’re going to compare to what we’re seeing in other parts of the world,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either way, there are more COVID cases in the U.S. than there were a few weeks ago. &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#maps_positivity-week" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="CDC data shows test positivity" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68750aebe4b00af0c5f268a4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#maps_positivity-week" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;CDC data shows test positivity&lt;/a&gt; is currently at 3.1%, up from 2.9%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what you can do to stay healthy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some summer activities — such as vacationing, lacking immunity from winter infections and vaccinations, and being in enclosed, air-conditioned spaces on hot days — can increase your risk of catching COVID, experts told HuffPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To lower your risk, there are a few things you can do, such as wearing a mask indoors and washing your hands well (and frequently), Landon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re 65 or older or have conditions that put you at high risk of complications from COVID, you are also &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s1023-covid-19-vaccine.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="eligible to get a second COVID shot" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68750aebe4b00af0c5f268a4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s1023-covid-19-vaccine.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;eligible to get a second COVID shot&lt;/a&gt; in the spring.

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lab-study-raises-concerns-that-sugar-substitute-erythritol-may-raise-risk-of-stroke"&gt;Lab Study Raises Concerns That Sugar Substitute Erythritol May Raise Risk Of Stroke&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-group has-octonary-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a Nutshell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Erythritol, found in many sugar-free drinks, was tested on human brain blood vessel cells in the lab.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The sweetener increased cellular stress and disrupted key protective pathways.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;These changes are known risk factors for stroke — but the study was short-term and done in cells only.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Researchers say more human research is needed to understand real-world health effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOULDER, Colo. —&lt;/strong&gt; That zero-calorie sweetener making your morning coffee taste just right might be quietly interfering with the tiny blood vessels in your brain — at least in a petri dish. A new laboratory study has found that erythritol, one of the most widely used artificial sweeteners, adversely affects the function of human brain blood vessel cells at levels similar to drinking just one can of diet soda.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Colorado-Boulder discovered that erythritol triggers a cascade of cellular changes that &lt;em&gt;could theoretically&lt;/em&gt; raise &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/stroke/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stroke risk&lt;/a&gt;: ramping up harmful oxidative stress inside cells, disrupting protective nitric oxide pathways, and blunting the brain’s natural clot-busting abilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team used concentrations of erythritol that match what someone would have in their bloodstream after consuming about 30 grams of the sweetener, which is roughly the amount in a standard &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/artificial-sweetener/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;artificially sweetened&lt;/a&gt; drink. It’s the same kind millions of people reach for daily, believing they’re making a healthier choice because it says “diet” or “sugar-free.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Erythritol’s popularity has surged over the past decade as consumers and food companies search for sugar alternatives that don’t &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/bllod-sugar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;spike blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt;. Found in everything from sugar-free gum and protein bars to energy drinks and low-calorie sodas, erythritol occurs naturally in some fruits but is now produced industrially for commercial use. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved it in 2001, and it’s marketed as a nearly ideal &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/common-sugar-substitute-xylitol-linked-to-blood-clots/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sugar substitute&lt;/a&gt;: it tastes about 60–80% as sweet as sugar, provides virtually no calories, and is generally considered safe for people with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-erythritol-alters-brain-vessel-cells"&gt;How Erythritol Alters Brain Vessel Cells&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Colorado Boulder focused on human brain microvascular endothelial cells. These are specialized cells that line the tiny blood vessels &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/brain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;in the brain&lt;/a&gt;. They are vital gatekeepers of the blood-brain barrier, regulating blood flow and blocking harmful substances from reaching brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the experiment, the team exposed these cells to a 6 millimolar (mM) concentration of erythritol for three hours — a dose that mimics typical human blood levels after consuming about 30 grams &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/artificial-sweetener-erythritol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;of the sweetener&lt;/a&gt;. The results were striking: erythritol increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) — a form of harmful cellular stress — by about 75%. It also disrupted the cells’ ability to produce nitric oxide, a protective molecule that keeps blood vessels open and healthy. Nitric oxide production dropped by around 20% in the erythritol-treated cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, levels of endothelin-1 (a powerful blood vessel constrictor) rose by about 30%. Tight regulation of blood vessel diameter is especially crucial in the brain, where steady blood flow is needed to keep neurons alive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most concerning was erythritol’s impact on the brain’s natural clot-busting system. When the researchers exposed the cells to thrombin, a protein that normally triggers the release of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) to dissolve clots, the untreated cells boosted their t-PA release by about 25%. But the erythritol-treated cells failed to respond at all.&lt;/p&gt;

(© TATIANA – stock.adobe.com)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-recipe-for-stroke"&gt;A Recipe for Stroke?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors note that these cellular changes represent “central characteristics of cerebral vascular endothelial dysfunction and causative factors in the development, severity, and outcome of ischemic stroke.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke — &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/3-health-risks-increase-odds-disabling-stroke/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;which happens when&lt;/a&gt; a clot blocks blood flow to part of the brain — accounts for nearly 87% of all strokes. The combination of increased cellular stress, reduced nitric oxide, elevated endothelin-1, and impaired clot-busting ability could, in theory, create conditions that increase the risk of these dangerous blockages. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers point out that brain blood vessels are especially vulnerable to this kind of damage because they contain large numbers of mitochondria, the tiny energy factories inside cells that are particularly sensitive to oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-it-time-to-substitute-sugar-subtitutes"&gt;Is It Time To Substitute Sugar Subtitutes?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These results, published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, are noteworthy given how common erythritol is and the mounting evidence linking it to cardiovascular issues. Recent large-scale studies have found that people with elevated blood levels of erythritol had a higher &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;risk of heart attacks&lt;/a&gt; and strokes over three years. A small follow-up trial showed that consuming 30 grams of erythritol significantly increased platelet activity and clotting potential in healthy volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike some cell studies that use unrealistically high doses, this research used erythritol levels that millions of people can realistically reach through normal consumption of sugar-free &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;foods and drinks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the researchers acknowledge that the study has important limitations: it was conducted in isolated cells over a short period and does not prove that consuming erythritol causes strokes in real people. However, the cellular pathways they identified have been linked to stroke risk in other studies and provide a plausible mechanism worth investigating further.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rethinking-erythritol-0"&gt;Rethinking Erythritol&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Erythritol’s rise from a niche ingredient to a mainstream sugar substitute reflects a broader trend: as obesity &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/obesity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;rates rise&lt;/a&gt; and more people try to manage &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diabetes,&lt;/a&gt; artificial sweeteners have become go-to products for cutting calories without giving up sweetness. Marketing often highlights the positives, noting that erythritol is “natural,” low-calorie, and doesn’t &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/gut-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;upset the gut&lt;/a&gt; the way other sugar substitutes can. But emerging research on its potential cardiovascular and cerebrovascular effects receives far less attention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, this new evidence suggests that while erythritol may still have a place for people managing diabetes or weight, it may not be the entirely risk-free alternative it’s sometimes made out to be. Instead of searching for the perfect &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/artificial-sweetener/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;artificial sugar substitute,&lt;/a&gt; many health experts argue that training our palates to crave less sweetness overall — from any source — could be a &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/wellness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthier long-term strategy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; This report summarizes the findings of an &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; (lab-based) study. The research did not test erythritol’s effects in living humans, so it does not prove that consuming erythritol causes stroke or other health problems. Always consult qualified health professionals for advice about your diet and health choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers cultured human brain blood vessel cells and treated them with erythritol at levels equivalent to consuming 30 grams (about one artificially sweetened beverage) for 3-24 hours. They measured cellular stress markers, protective compound production, and clot-fighting responses. The study used five experimental units and employed standard cell culture techniques with appropriate controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erythritol treatment caused a 75% increase in harmful cellular stress and reduced protective nitric oxide production by 20%. The sweetener increased blood vessel constrictor production by 30% and completely blocked the normal clot-fighting response. While cells attempted to compensate by increasing protective proteins, this wasn’t sufficient to prevent overall cellular damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This was a laboratory study using isolated brain cells over short time periods, so results may not directly translate to whole-body effects in living humans. Researchers couldn’t assess long-term exposure effects and didn’t test other artificial sweeteners for comparison. The study also couldn’t determine if cellular changes would reverse after erythritol exposure ended.&lt;/p&gt;

The study found HCV specifically in the choroid plexus, a structure producing cerebrospinal fluid, but not inside brain tissue itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of medical records confirmed higher HCV prevalence in these disorders compared to controls and major depression. The findings raise hope that antiviral treatments could alleviate symptoms for some patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;HCV was detected in the brain lining—not brain tissue—of people with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with these disorders were 7 times more likely to have HCV than healthy controls.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Infection in the brain lining altered gene expression in memory-related brain regions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;JHU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observational studies of psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression have long tied viral infections with behavioral symptoms in these disorders, but scientists have been unable to find direct evidence of suspected viruses in the brain. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say that’s possibly because viruses may not get directly inside the brain, but may target the brain lining instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After testing that idea using postmortem human brain samples and the electronic medical records of 285 million patients, a team of Johns Hopkins Medicine scientists says it has found such evidence in the form of the liver-damaging hepatitis C virus in the human brain’s choroid plexus, a collection of cells that make up the lining of the fluid-filled cavities, or ventricles, and — notably — produce the cerebrospinal fluid that protects the brain and spinal cord.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A report on the study, led by investigators at Johns Hopkins Children’s Center, published July 14 in &lt;em&gt;Translational Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings confirm previous studies that reported higher than usual hepatitis C (HCV) prevalence in people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and suggest that HCV infections may be associated with the cause of disease rather than behaviors such as intravenous drug use, according to the Johns Hopkins team led by Sarven Sabunciyan, Ph.D., a neuroscientist at the Children’s Center and an associate professor of pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, the team first analyzed choroid plexus samples from postmortem brains of individuals with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or major depression, as well as unaffected controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The samples were obtained from the Stanley Medical Research Institute collection, a widely used postmortem repository of brain tissue from people with mental health disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then performed high-throughput sequencing using the Twist Comprehensive Viral Research Panel, a commercial technology that enables identification of more than 3,000 viruses in human samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because previous psychiatric disorder studies had failed to identify viruses inside the brain, the researchers specifically focused on the choroid plexus, which is known as a structure that is targeted by viruses. The analysis revealed the presence of various viruses in the choroid plexus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that more viruses were present in samples from people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. But, unlike other viruses, HCV was only present in the brain lining of people who had schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the virus was not present in some individuals who were known to have a chronic HCV diagnosis, suggesting that the infection does not always spread to the brain lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HCV infection is common, generally contracted through infected blood, and characterized by inflammation of the liver that can lead to serious complications and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An estimated 50 million people have chronic HCV infections worldwide, with about 1 million new infections occurring each year. About 50% to 75% of cases carry no symptoms. The infections are treatable with antiviral drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bipolar disorder, characterized by episodes of manic behavior and serious depression, is estimated to have affected approximately 9 in 200 adults in the U.S. at some time in their lives, while schizophrenia, marked by disorganized thinking and hallucinations, and related psychotic disorders are estimated to affect between 1 and 3 in 400 adults in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the next phase of the study, the research team analyzed electronic health records held by TriNetX, and found that HCV was documented in 3.6% of those with schizophrenia and 3.9% of those with bipolar disorder — almost double that of those with major depression (1.8%), and approximately sevenfold higher than the control population (0.5%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers say while illicit drug use is common among people with all three disorders, drug use did not account for the higher prevalence of HCV in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder compared with major depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also looked for viral RNA in sequencing data from the hippocampus, a region of the brain that supports learning, memory and other functions, of subjects identified to have HCV, and found that the virus was absent in this tissue despite being present in the brain lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the presence of HCV in the brain lining altered gene expression in the hippocampus, providing a possible mechanism by which an infection in the lining can affect brain functions and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the researchers caution that their study does not suggest that everyone with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder has an HCV infection, they believe their findings provide compelling support for the existence of the virus in the choroid plexus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that it’s possible that some people may be having psychiatric symptoms because they have an infection, and since the hepatitis C infection is treatable, it might be possible for this patient subset to be treated with antiviral drugs and not have to deal with psychiatric symptoms,” Sabunciyan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says he also hopes to collaborate with mental health professionals to screen for HCV in people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia to learn whether treating the infection will ease or stop symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with Sabunciyan, authors from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine are Ashwin Balagopal, Ou Chen and Jeffrey Quinn.

A potential reason for this discrepancy may be that viruses are more likely to infect the neuroepithelium than neural tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this hypothesis, we used viral sequence enrichment technology and performed RNA sequencing in postmortem choroid plexus (CP) isolated from 84 SCZ, 73 BPD, 23 MDD cases and 76 unaffected controls (CNT) from the Stanley Medical Research Institute brain collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach enabled us to identify the presence of 13 viral species in the CP of 46 subjects. We discovered that CP samples collected from subjects with SCZ and BPD are more likely to contain viral sequences. In terms of individual viruses, the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) was the only viral species that reached the threshold of statistical significance for an association with SCZ and BPD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we focused on HCV to characterize the association between psychiatric disorders and viruses. Analysis of the TriNetX electronic health record database with data on 285 million patients revealed that the prevalence of chronic HCV was 3.6 and 3.9 percent in the SCZ and BPD populations respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of chronic HCV in these populations was almost double that observed for MDD (1.8%) and approximately 7-fold higher than the control population (0.5%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings confirm previous studies that report higher HCV prevalence in SCZ and BPD and suggest that HCV infection may be associated with disease pathology rather than behaviors such as intravenous drug injection, since these behaviors are present in all three disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed hippocampus RNA sequencing data from the subjects identified to be HCV positive via sequence capture. We found that although the virus was absent in this tissue, HCV RNA in the CP was associated with consistent host transcriptional changes in the hippocampus that were potentially related to the innate immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results are consistent with previous studies and provide clues regarding the contribution of viruses to the pathology of psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 12:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFBqOVVUN2JnTXpiVnktTklQd0dHZGRILXZDZmF4bm0zWXNJQTFEZU9pcG00UlBib3JuZGNYRUxjSXM4NmNsUFc5LTVYb0NXSXJHcTJKa2ctUjdydjZETTBUaUFiZnNuWjBpS2x0QUtn</guid></item><item><title>您患有维生素B2缺乏症的1号体征-预防 | The Number-1 Sign You Have a Vitamin B2 Deficiency - Prevention</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQejVXSkZWOWNUM2ZlTEdrV2RyVnlsOWswZTNkV1BCZE5PUXJ4ck5GTUNNTy1HTFlWbW42bW1uMzRKczBDVUhFOUloT2hJbFExV2lQaXRFQVR2emI5Y0Q4ZFBaQXh3T192MUl2a0pfVm1pSVBVbU1pcHdRMTVDNk03RVVjMGZLd2F0aEY0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-zl6cs0 et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;br data-node-id="1.0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s hard to go a day without someone on social media declaring that you’re probably deficient in a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/vitamins-supplements/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/vitamins-supplements/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="vitamin" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; and need to take a supplement.

But if you notice one or several of these at once, it’s worth consulting a healthcare professional for a deeper dive into your health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="10" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="10.0"&gt;Fatigue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The cause of fatigue is an admittedly tough thing to pin down. Have you been working out too hard? Are you getting enough iron? Is your sleep off? Or is it your vitamin B2 levels? You can develop anemia, a condition where your body doesn’t have enough healthy red blood cells, when you have too-low levels of riboflavin over a longer period of time, according to the NIH. Among other things, that can make you feel weak and fatigued. But there’s another reason why a lack of riboflavin can make you feel tired, according to Keri Gans, R.D.N., dietitian and host of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1576256&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpodcasts.apple.com%2Fus%2Fpodcast%2Fthe-keri-report%2Fid1505586646" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-node-id="11.1" data-href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-keri-report/id1505586646" data-product-url="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-keri-report/id1505586646" data-affiliate="true" data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1576256&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpodcasts.apple.com%2Fus%2Fpodcast%2Fthe-keri-report%2Fid1505586646" data-affiliate-network='{"site_id":"d55f98dc-cbd6-4679-ae11-243969f8c772","metadata":null,"network":{"name":"Skimlinks"},"product_metadata":null,"afflink_redirect":"/_p/afflink/wWgF/apple-id1505586646-the-keri-report-podca"}' data-vars-ga-product-brand="podcasts.apple.com" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="e67f8106-2352-4e85-a11e-8b298b49f6f7" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="podcasts.apple.com" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-axid="5a01ccb2-562e-4a2a-9f0d-290d8e61e7ff" data-skimlinks-tracking="[utm_source|[utm_campaign|[utm_medium|[gclid|[msclkid|[fbclid|[refdomain|www.google.com[content_id|be7524af-4d93-4901-ab55-973de88d4d32[content_product_id|3a4dff0e-7199-4275-b00f-2ffcc7d881a5[product_retailer_id|e67f8106-2352-4e85-a11e-8b298b49f6f7[lt|[axid|5a01ccb2-562e-4a2a-9f0d-290d8e61e7ff[ofsxid|pushly_notifications_prv[ofsvid|active]" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-keri-report/id1505586646" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Keri Report podcast" data-vars-ga-product-id="743a1f2a-ed42-4db0-aed3-ac1f3a7cec12" rel="nofollow" class="body-link product-links css-inlxvj e1aq0z090"&gt;The Keri Report podcast&lt;/a&gt;. “Riboflavin helps your body convert carbohydrates into fuel and plays a big role in how your cells produce energy,” she says. “Fatigue can happen when that process breaks down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="12" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="12.0"&gt;Cracked lips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Again, this may be due to something else, including not taking in enough liquids regularly. But cracked lips may also be a sign of low B2, according to Ife J. Rodney, M.D., a dermatologist and founding director of &lt;a href="https://eternaldermatology.com/" target="_blank" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://eternaldermatology.com/"}' data-offer-url="https://eternaldermatology.com/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://eternaldermatology.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Eternal Dermatology + Aesthetics" data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="13.1.0"&gt;Eternal Dermatology + Aesthetics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Riboflavin helps with moisture retention,” she says. If you’re low in the nutrient, your lips’ natural moisture can suffer as a result, leading to cracking and even bleeding.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="14" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="14.0"&gt;Crusty corners of the mouth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;This is a more unique symptom of riboflavin deficiency, leading to lesions at the corners of your mouth. “You may get scaling or cracking in the corners of the mouth,” Dr. Rodney says. (This may even show up in the corners of your mouth and ears, she adds.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="16" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="16.0"&gt;Scaly patches on your skin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Scaly patches can be a symptom of several skin conditions, but they may also be due to a lack of B2. “Riboflavin helps with tissue repair and cell turnover,” Dr. Rodney explains. “Any time you have issues with tissue repair or cell turnover, that’s when you get cracking or scaling.” These scaly patches will often look red or discolored from your usual skin color, she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="18" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="18.0"&gt;Sore throat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Riboflavin deficiency may cause swelling in your mouth and throat, making it feel like you have a sore throat, according to the NIH. “Since riboflavin is also crucial for overall cell function, low levels can affect fast-healing areas like the skin and mouth, leading to symptoms like a sore throat,” Gans says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="20" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="20.0"&gt;Unexplained hair loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;That cell turnover that can impact the health of your lips and skin may also affect your hair, Dr. Rodney says. When you don’t have enough riboflavin, it can impact the production of collagen, a type of protein that supports hair follicle (and skin) health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="22" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="22.0"&gt;Reproductive issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Fertility is incredibly complicated, and it’s hard to say that adding more B2 to your diet will magically help you conceive. But not having enough riboflavin can interfere with several areas of reproduction, including the development of sperm and eggs, and ovulation, along with early development of the embryo, says &lt;a href="https://askdrgreves.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://askdrgreves.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Christine Greves, M.D." data-node-id="23.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="23.1.0"&gt;Christine Greves, M.D.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ob/gyn at the Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies in Orlando, Fla. (Worth noting: Many prenatal vitamins contain riboflavin.) Still, this isn’t usually a go-to solution for doctors when you’re struggling to conceive. “I don’t ask someone when they’re trying to get pregnant if they’re taking riboflavin,” Dr. Greves says. “But I do say that you should be having well-balanced meals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="24" data-lazy-id="P0-16"&gt;&lt;h2 title="How to tell if you have a vitamin B2 deficiency" data-anchor-id="how-to-tell-if-you-have-a-vitamin-b2-deficiency" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emt9r7s1"&gt;How to tell if you have a vitamin B2 deficiency&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Ultimately, if you suspect you might have a vitamin B2 deficiency, it’s important to see a healthcare provider for a proper evaluation. “A blood test is the gold standard,” says &lt;a href="https://jessicacordingnutrition.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://jessicacordingnutrition.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jessica Cording, R.D" data-node-id="25.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="25.1.0"&gt;Jessica Cording, R.D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;., author of &lt;em data-node-id="25.3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/163228068X?tag=prevention-auto-20" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-node-id="25.3.0" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/163228068X?" data-product-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/163228068X?" data-affiliate="true" data-affiliate-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/163228068X?tag=prevention-auto-20" data-affiliate-network='{"afflink_redirect":"/_p/afflink/wWfx/amazon-s-dp-163228068x","site_id":"d55f98dc-cbd6-4679-ae11-243969f8c772","network":{"name":"Amazon"},"metadata":{"links":{"default":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/163228068X?tag=prevention-auto-20","sem":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/163228068X?tag=pv-lift-20","social":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/163228068X?tag=pv-soc-lift-20"}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price="$20.95" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="b96c5905-cfac-48d4-a33c-55d89cf84f2a" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-axid="0275d270-1865-440f-a721-d946fbd64c1a" data-amazon-ascsubtag="[artid|2141.a.63740323[src|www.google.com[ch|[lt|[pid|a8ab7172-3a5e-4357-97cf-a26125436900[axid|0275d270-1865-440f-a721-d946fbd64c1a[ofsxid|pushly_notifications_prv[ofsvid|active" data-aps-asc-tag="prevention-auto-20" data-aps-asc-subtag="[artid|2141.a.63740323[src|www.google.com[ch|[lt|[pid|a8ab7172-3a5e-4357-97cf-a26125436900[axid|0275d270-1865-440f-a721-d946fbd64c1a[ofsxid|pushly_notifications_prv[ofsvid|active" rel="nofollow" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/163228068X?" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Little Book of Game-Changers" data-vars-ga-product-id="ab1b7425-b0d6-48ab-b0c9-597ccefb1bc1" class="body-link product-links css-inlxvj e1aq0z090"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="25.3.0.0"&gt;The Little Book of Game-Changers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="25.4"&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;“This will give you information on how deficient you may be.” You and your healthcare provider can make decisions on next steps from there.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="26" data-lazy-id="P0-17"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Which foods are rich in vitamin B2?" data-anchor-id="which-foods-are-rich-in-vitamin-b2" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emt9r7s1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="26.0"&gt;Which foods are rich in vitamin B2?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;There are a few food sources of vitamin B2 to consider adding to your diet. According to the NIH, some of the biggest ones include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="28" class="css-1wk73g0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.0"&gt;     Beef liver, 3 ounces, 2.9 milligrams&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.1"&gt;     Fortified breakfast cereals, 1 serving, 1.3 milligrams&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.2"&gt;     Oats, 1 cup, 1.1 milligrams&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.3"&gt;     Plain yogurt, 1 cup, 0.6 milligrams&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.4"&gt;     2% milk, 1 cup, 0.5 milligrams&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;B2 recommendations vary slightly by age, sex, and life phase. Most genetic adult women need 1.1 milligrams a day of riboflavin, according to the NIH. However, those who are pregnant need 1.4 milligrams and those who are breastfeeding need 1.6 milligrams.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Most genetic adult men need 1.3 milligrams daily of riboflavin, per the NIH. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="32" data-lazy-id="P0-19"&gt;&lt;h2 title="How can I increase my B2 naturally?" data-anchor-id="how-can-i-increase-my-b2-naturally" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emt9r7s1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="32.0"&gt;How can I increase my B2 naturally?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="33" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Adding more B2-rich foods to your diet can help, Dr. Rodney says. “I recommend mostly focusing on your diet,” she says. If that doesn’t seem to help, she says a supplement may work—just consult a healthcare provider first about the proper dosing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="35" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;There are a few things that may happen when you take vitamin B2. “Some individuals experience digestive discomfort, nausea, or bloating,” says Scott Keatley, R.D., co-owner of &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://keatleymnt.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy" data-node-id="35.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="35.1.0"&gt;Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (Taking it on an empty stomach may make this worse, he says.) Something else to consider, per Keatley: “Excess riboflavin can turn urine bright yellow, which is harmless but sometimes alarming.” That said, you’re likely to just pee out the riboflavin you don’t need. “B2 is a water-soluble vitamin, so excess amounts are typically excreted in urine,” Gans says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="36" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Overall, Cording stresses the importance of only taking a supplement under the guidance of a healthcare provider. “It’s the best way to go,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="37" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="37.0"&gt;Dietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet. They are not medicines and are not intended to treat, diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or cure diseases. Be cautious about taking dietary supplements if you are pregnant or nursing. Also, be careful about giving supplements to a child, unless recommended by their healthcare provider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 12:33:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQejVXSkZWOWNUM2ZlTEdrV2RyVnlsOWswZTNkV1BCZE5PUXJ4ck5GTUNNTy1HTFlWbW42bW1uMzRKczBDVUhFOUloT2hJbFExV2lQaXRFQVR2emI5Y0Q4ZFBaQXh3T192MUl2a0pfVm1pSVBVbU1pcHdRMTVDNk03RVVjMGZLd2F0aEY0</guid></item><item><title>导致肥胖的原因是什么？一项重要的新研究正在颠覆常识。- MSN | What causes obesity?

                        &lt;p&gt;As temperatures rose in King County, so did the spread of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dph" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Public Health &lt;span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody"&gt;– &lt;/span&gt;Seattle and King County&lt;/a&gt; has seen an increase in emergency visits for COVID-19 over the last month, although the numbers are significantly lower than last year, as shown by data from the agency. The blue line represents 2024 to 2025, while the yellow line represents 2023 to 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_4109991" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="https://mynorthwest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/COVID-19-data.jpg"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4109991" class=" wp-image-4109991" src="https://mynorthwest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/COVID-19-data-300x169.jpg" alt="COVID-19 data" srcset="https://mynorthwest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/COVID-19-data-300x169.jpg 300w, https://mynorthwest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/COVID-19-data-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mynorthwest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/COVID-19-data-700x394.jpg 700w, https://mynorthwest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/COVID-19-data-420x236.jpg 420w, https://mynorthwest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/COVID-19-data-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mynorthwest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/COVID-19-data.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-4109991" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;COVID-19 data from Public Health – Seattle and King County.

&lt;h2&gt;At-home COVID-19 tests used more frequently&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We do typically see a rise in COVID during the summer,” Dr. Eric Chow, Chief of Communicable Disease Epidemiology &amp;amp; Immunization for Public Health – Seattle and King County, wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;MyNorthwest&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the number of COVID-19 diagnoses could be much higher as more people continue to use at-home tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody"&gt;“Home COVID tests, also called rapid tests, are generally effective and accurate, including for new COVID variants, although people may test positive at different points during their illness course,” Chow wrote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To properly test for the virus, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends two negative rapid tests for those with symptoms, performed 48 hours apart, or three negative antigen tests for those without symptoms, also done 48 hours apart. Specific details about each at-home test can be found on the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/home-otc-covid-19-diagnostic-tests" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;FDA’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is suggested that everyone ages 6 months and up stay up to date on vaccinations, as the virus is frequently mutating, Chow stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Each updated COVID vaccine is tailored for more recently circulating variants and therefore can better help protect you from infection and, if you do get infected, can help protect you from severe infection and long-COVID,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
                        
                    &lt;/p&gt;
                
&lt;h3&gt;No increase seen in flu or RSV visits in King County&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chow also noted that while COVID-19 emergency department visits have risen, Public Health – Seattle and King County has not seen an increase in flu or RSV visits over the last month. Although testing for other viruses that cause cold symptoms is not commonly ordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent getting sick, Chow recommends staying up to date on vaccines, wearing a well-fitting, high-quality face mask in indoor crowded spaces, such as malls or airports, and holding gatherings outdoors whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;

However, the symptom worsened after she was prescribed weight loss injections in November 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t have any other symptoms apart from that,” Stirling said of her heartburn, before adding, “I wasn’t losing weight, I wasn’t anemic, I didn’t have any blood in my stools or anything like that. I wasn’t vomiting, and my appetite was brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The typical symptoms that you see for stomach cancer, I had none of them,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Petrus Ibars/Getty&lt;/p&gt; Semaglutide injection pen (stock image)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heartburn is a common side effect of using weight loss injections. According to &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/obesity/mounjaro-side-effects" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:WebMD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WebMD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 1 in 50 people involved in a Mounjaro clinical trial experienced heartburn, acid reflux, or GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stirling said her symptoms largely went away after she stopped taking weight-loss injections, but she still went for an endoscopy in January 2024. A camera was placed down her throat and into her stomach to examine if there was any cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medics told her that she appeared to have an ulcer — an open sore in the stomach — that was almost “completely healed.” They also said she had Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), a common bacteria that can cause sores and inflammation in the lining of the stomach or the upper part of the small intestine, according to &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/h-pylori-helicobacter-pylori" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:WebMD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WebMD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In some cases, the bacteria can also lead to stomach cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They gave me some treatment and said to come back in six weeks [when they were planning to] check that the ulcer has healed,” Stirling recalled of the medics. “When I went back in six weeks, that little red mark was still there, so they sent some biopsies off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They had not said they were worried about cancer, which they would normally do if they were thinking ‘ooh it looks nasty,’ ” she continued. “I was completely blinded when three weeks later I got a phone call to say I have something called signet ring cell adenocarcinoma, which is the most aggressive stomach cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stirling was told that the disease was likely caused by the H. pylori that she could have unknowingly had since childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She explained that her diagnosis was followed by a staging laparoscopy — a keyhole operation that involves the use of small cameras to examine inside the abdomen. She then underwent multiple rounds of chemotherapy and had surgery to remove her entire stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;LightFieldStudios/Getty&lt;/p&gt; Woman in hospital (stock image)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stirling said a CT scan in January 2025 showed that she was “all clear,” but the surgeons have followed up with her every three months since and she is due to have another CT scan in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overall, I'm doing really well, getting my strength back,” she said. “I'm training for a half-marathon in October this year. I’m back in the gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Obviously, I've lost a lot of weight because I don't have a stomach, so my eating is very different now, I have a lot of smaller portions,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a follow-up &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@clostirlingx/video/7519609762749697302" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TikTok video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;TikTok video&lt;/a&gt;, Stirling encouraged viewers to seek medical help if they’re regularly experiencing heartburn, although the symptom isn’t always an indicator of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s so important to get little things checked out,” she said. “Even if you just think, ‘Oh, I’ll just see how it goes.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anything that you just know in your body isn’t right, I’d push to go and get it checked,” she added. “It’s what, like 15 minutes out of your day to go to a doctor’s appointment that could potentially save your life.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/woman-diagnosed-stomach-cancer-weight-loss-injections-heartburn-11772215" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 11:40:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE1mYXZscVlBd2RmeEFDQXdXbDVGNVR5Uk1jRUhNSjBLblpFVFdTdU8wUDZBQ05ubnJBRzd0YXpoZVBaTGlkY1Z3bVZsQ2lMRkVDdmp5bmZLejVrZ3RNYUlPLXdfQm12UjhRdFFuMUNLbHdmazQ</guid></item><item><title>在开始服用GLP-1药物之前，医生希望你知道的5件事-《华盛顿邮报》 | 5 things doctors want you to know before you start taking a GLP-1 drug - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxPVF9tRk1vOFZ2dEZQSHM0ak83VF9ySmZldTNWaXdRbjk2WFNhbTlEbkFNTkdsQThLa2ZZT2plcnQ5YzRkeVdLa3c5LXVfakdFMzRTRlliaTJ4N3ppbTJjYXRhRmE1eDhLMnRIVUdSOHJhcy1LNnE0VHJIZS1kWTRsVE1iYmJ6NTJ4a0R3RVpySQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EFH62P3V4FA3PIGLWRCSHHQU4Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Roughly 16 million American adults are taking &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/23/ozempic-wegovy-change-life-spending/" target="_blank"&gt;GLP-1 medications&lt;/a&gt;. They are a major breakthrough for people to shed pounds and manage conditions such as Type 2 diabetes. However, doctors say there’s a perception that weight-loss drugs such as semaglutide (brand names Ozempic and Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Zepbound) are all you need to live a healthier life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JWIMJOECNZAE5IZ3SJFGHONVJQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Diet and exercise still matter, said &lt;a href="https://prevmed.bwh.harvard.edu/joann-e-manson-md-dph/" target="_blank"&gt;JoAnn Manson&lt;/a&gt;, chief of the division of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4OYW2YZIQ5CFVEJICEG7KSWMGE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“They remain crucial,” Manson said. “If you’re not paying attention to protein intake, hydration and having regular physical activity — especially resistance training — you can end up with poor nutritional status and substantial muscle loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XDGKSFGJFZDJVOWQ5PYVL7UIG4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;GLP-1 drugs mimic a hormone the body produces to regulate hunger and blood sugar. The injections cut cravings for food, slow digestion and keep people feeling full for longer periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4NCTCHFXSFBHJATCL42UVVZB3Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;However, since the drugs affect the stomach’s functions, they also can cause gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea and vomiting. Some people stop taking the drugs because of these gut symptoms. Still, Manson said, with some “relatively straightforward” changes in behavior, people can minimize these problems and continue using the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LNBG5PEWOZF6FM6JXBQR5BJWIM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Manson is a co-author of two articles — one for &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2836533?widget=personalizedcontent&amp;amp;previousarticle=0" target="_blank"&gt;clinicians&lt;/a&gt; and another for &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.1133?guestAccessKey=36da2db9-78f9-4823-be41-f21c6fa9a614&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=071425" target="_blank"&gt;patients&lt;/a&gt; — that were recently published in JAMA Internal Medicine.

The weight you lose might include muscle, too&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QGY3QHDK45EGVAUDE5HDNIPPR4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;These medications can help someone lose around 15 to 21 percent of their body weight. But a significant portion of that weight — up to one-fourth — can be lean body mass and muscle, Manson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="3DZJGTLSLRFRVNP74YKDC67IYM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="3DZJGTLSLRFRVNP74YKDC67IYM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;2. It can help to start every meal with 20 to 30 grams of protein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QVPDC2XBLVEH5NM6ZMUG5YYC3M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This protein can come&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;from chicken, fish, beans, chickpeas or tofu, Manson said. Aim for 1 to 1.5 grams of protein each day per kilogram (2.2 pounds) of body weight. If you don’t have an appetite or are eating smaller meals, you may want to try drinking a protein shake throughout the day as a supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZUUXS3V6PBFAFPUSQEDFVP2BRM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Manson and her co-authors suggest filling a plate this way: half fruits and vegetables, one-quarter protein, and the rest whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="Q6YZ2W4IF5DARPBOTOXULBNCDI" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="Q6YZ2W4IF5DARPBOTOXULBNCDI" data-testid="article-header"&gt;3. Resistance training two to three times a week can build muscle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QUAOAF2FIRDKFLBEELXHTE33SE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You can strengthen your muscles with bands, weights and body-weight exercises to counteract the potential loss in lean body mass, Manson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FF2DQC2ZRZBEFM2Z7237T2ZMWA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Aim for 60 to 90 minutes of resistance training and 150 minutes of aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="L22O7IOSFJBILNCVBCAW2YM3L4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="L22O7IOSFJBILNCVBCAW2YM3L4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;4. It’s a good idea to drink more water&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KADHMNVAYVCTPMOBFEGIDV7SXU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Water can help with the dehydration and constipation associated with the weight-loss drugs, said Manson, who recommended 8 to 12 glasses per day. You also can eat water-rich foods such as cucumbers and watermelon to stay hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BYQVV36EU5ACLIYYPUBOALXTOM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And the researchers recommend that people on GLP-1 drugs limit their intake of alcohol, caffeine, and sugary or artificially sweetened beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="AOWXQZZNWBCGDCTH7BK4QF4XEQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="AOWXQZZNWBCGDCTH7BK4QF4XEQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;5. You should avoid lying down for two to three hours after a meal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XAX7WHZ2ZZCVVO4JE3256ZYWEI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This may help reduce your risk of heartburn. Add fiber to help with constipation, and avoid high-fat foods — or fried foods — because they can worsen feelings of nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="J2GTBHS25VDXLGZCXUW4LH2BSM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="J2GTBHS25VDXLGZCXUW4LH2BSM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What do other experts say?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y3VYLU3XHFFCXE5YYJFKHVOBHQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/acosta-andres-j-m-d-ph-d/bio-20189108" target="_blank"&gt;Andres J. Acosta&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of medicine and a consultant in gastroenterology and hepatology at the Mayo Clinic, who has also consulted for Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, and has co-founded two weight-loss-associated companies, Phenomix Sciences and Gila Therapeutics, said he often finds that patients have a “preconceived notion” that they just need to take the medication and they’ll lose weight. But the clinical trials for these weight-loss drugs included “comprehensive programs” with lifestyle interventions for a calorie-reduced diet and exercise program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VBHME7KNWJF2HMJAWXEDOWS5BY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“This perception — just take the shot and don’t do anything else — is wrong. It’s not going to drive real, long-term behavioral changes,” said Acosta, who is a co-author of “The Mayo Clinic Diet: Weight-Loss Medications Edition.” “Patients aren’t going to see the outcomes that we’re seeing in the trials.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4GOJZZAHGNDCJP7JKE65RRJVHY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The GLP-1 medications are one tool in a broader weight-management program, Acosta said.
