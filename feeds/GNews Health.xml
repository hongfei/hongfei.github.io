                A cloud of smog hovers above Lebanon's capital Beirut on August 14, 2025. Air pollution from diesel generators and smokey tailpipes are among the reasons that cancer is surging in Lebanon.

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthdata.org/about/people/ali-mokdad" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ali Mokdad&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; stands in the heart of Beirut. Cars and trucks and motorcycles rumble everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you look at a car passing by, you see smoke coming out of it — that's illegal in Lebanon. But nobody enforce[s] it," says Mokda, the chief strategy officer of population health at the University of Washington.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As a result, Beirut has terrible air quality and is often submerged under a blanket of exhaust. And it's not just in the big cities — vehicles belch pollution across the country.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's one reason that cancer is surging in Lebanon. Mokdad co-authored &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01635-6/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a global survey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that revealed that the tiny nation on the Mediterranean is experiencing the fastest increase in cancer incidence and mortality anywhere in the world. According to the study, published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;, the frequency of new cancer cases in Lebanon has increased by an astounding 162% from 1990 to 2023, with cancer-related deaths increasing by 80% over that same period. In 2023, for every 100,000 people in the country, there were 233.5 new cancer cases.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The news is sobering elsewhere too. The survey predicts that cancer cases and cancer deaths will continue to rise worldwide through at least 2050, especially in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, Lebanon has reason to be especially alarmed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's behind the dramatic rise in cancer in Lebanon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mokdad grew up in Lebanon before moving abroad almost 40 years ago. For him, like many here, the disease is personal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm losing cousins," he says. "I'm scared. I'm losing them at a very young age. It's not only death. It's also diseases. They have so many health problems."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-94534" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;There are various reasons why cancer is surging in Lebanon. A big one is air pollution from both vehicles and diesel-fueled generators that many homes and businesses use due to unreliable state electricity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In addition, "we overuse chemicals for our agriculture," says Mokdad. Some of these compounds along with sewage ends up in certain rivers. "People don't drink it but they wash their tabbouleh and their fattoush with it. They're consuming this."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By far the biggest risk factor, however, is smoking.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There is no more taboo about smoking," Mokdad says. "Everybody smokes. Kids smoke in front of their parents. Yesterday, I went with some of my friends for dinner. You come home, you stink of tobacco."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;It's gotten to the point where Mokdad keeps a set of clothes in Lebanon that he only wears there.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are no public health campaigns warning against the dangers of smoking or secondhand smoke. Instead, Mokdad says &lt;a href="https://www.regie.com.lb/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the government&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is actually in the business of &lt;a href="https://www.tobaccotactics.org/article/lebanon-country-profile/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;buying and selling tobacco&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The inevitable result is that lung cancer rates have jumped nationwide. In addition, leukemia and pancreatic and liver cancers have risen. The increases in prostate, colon and breast cancers are all preventable through early screening and detection.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The issue, says Mokdad, is that although screening is available, most people don't know to seek it out. "Health education is a problem," he explains. "If you caught [cancer] earlier," people wouldn't have to die.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The global survey on cancer and Lebanon's troubling trends with the disease caught the attention of members of the Lebanese parliament. It's why they invited Mokdad to come talk to lawmakers and experts about his findings.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change will be a journey, a slow one at that &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Mokdad traveled to Beirut for the meeting, which was held inside one of the Parliament buildings. After walking through the results of the study and describing the peril that cancer poses, Mokdad suggested to the officials that Lebanon could improve its health screening, ban smoking in public spaces and launch a set of aggressive anti-tobacco ads. By way of example, he pointed to a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFQ6YoDAoeY" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;public health campaign&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; launched by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. a decade ago, one that the CDC and other researchers say prevented &lt;a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(20)30468-2/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;129,100 early deaths&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; between 2012 and 2018.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-94530" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Ali Mokdad briefs lawmakers about his report which shows how serious the frequency of cancer is in Lebanon. He tells lawmakers the country needs to improve its health screening, ban smoking in public spaces and launch an aggressive anti-tobacco campaign.  "Many people in the parliament said, 'I'm not surprised with this finding.' And my question: What are you doing about it? "

   &lt;p&gt;Inaya Ezzeddine is a member of parliament and a physician who ran the proceedings. She explains that any kind of government response will take time. "It's a journey," she says. "It's not something that we can implement overnight because it has to do with a lot of sectors. We have to work hard toward this political will."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;A committee will be formed to examine the data and determine which laws will need enacting or strengthening to address the problem.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of the attendees, &lt;a href="https://aub.edu.lb/pages/profile.aspx?memberID=nuwayhid" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Iman Nuwayhid&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of public health at the American University of Beirut, believes that individuals should take responsibility too. "We're accountable to making our country cleaner, reduce pollution, improve the environment," he says. "Of course, the government plays a bigger role, but we have a big responsibility. Local communities again should push in that direction."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mokdad argues that the time is now for the government to act and support people in making the right decisions about their health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I know Lebanese have to deal with a lot of things," he says. "But cancer is killing. Many people in the parliament said, 'I'm not surprised with this finding.' And my question: What are you doing about it? Why have you been waiting so long to take action?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A couple blocks from the building where the meeting was held, a mother and son are seated outside, taking a break from work.

    &lt;p&gt;Social media and lifestyle magazines have turned gluten – a protein in wheat, rye and barley – into a dietary villain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/news/novak-djokovic-gluten-free-diet"&gt;Athletes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/food/pictures/celebrities-who-follow-gluten-free-diets/"&gt;celebrities&lt;/a&gt; have promoted gluten-free eating as the secret to better health and performance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But our &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01533-8/abstract"&gt;review in The Lancet&lt;/a&gt; published today challenges that idea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By examining decades of research, we found that for most people who think they react to gluten, gluten itself is rarely the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Symptoms but not coeliac&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coeliac disease is when the body’s immune system attacks itself when someone eats gluten, leading to inflammation and damage to the gut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But people with gut or other symptoms after eating foods containing gluten can test &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; for coeliac disease or wheat allergy. They are said to have non-coeliac gluten sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to understand whether gluten itself, or other factors, truly cause their symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What we did and what we found&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our study combined more than 58 studies covering symptom changes and possible ways they could arise. These included studying the immune system, gut barrier, microbes in the gut, and psychological explanations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across studies, gluten-specific reactions were uncommon and, when they occurred, changes in symptoms were usually small. Many participants who believed they were “gluten sensitive” reacted equally – or more strongly – to a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2013.04.051"&gt;One landmark trial&lt;/a&gt; looked at the role of fermentable carbohydrates (known as FODMAPs) in people who said they were sensitive to gluten (but didn’t have coeliac disease). When people ate &lt;a href="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/high-and-low-fodmap-foods/"&gt;a low-FODMAP diet&lt;/a&gt; – avoiding foods such as certain fruits, vegetables, legumes and cereals – their symptoms improved, even when gluten was reintroduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2017.10.040"&gt;Another showed&lt;/a&gt; fructans – a type of FODMAP in wheat, onion, garlic and other foods – caused more bloating and discomfort than gluten itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggests most people who feel unwell after eating gluten are sensitive to something else. This could be FODMAPs such as fructans, or other wheat proteins. Another explanation could be that symptoms reflect a disorder in how the gut interacts with the brain, similar to irritable bowel syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people may be truly sensitive to gluten. However, current evidence suggests this is uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;People expected symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A consistent finding is how expecting to have symptoms profoundly shapes people’s symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-1253(23)00317-5"&gt;In blinded trials&lt;/a&gt;, when people unknowingly ate gluten or placebo, symptom differences &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-1253(25)00090-1"&gt;almost vanished&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some who expected gluten to make them unwell developed identical discomfort when exposed to a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This nocebo effect – the negative counterpart of placebo – shows that belief and prior experience influence how the brain processes signals from the gut. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118229"&gt;Brain-imaging research&lt;/a&gt; supports this, showing that expectation and emotion activate brain regions involved in pain and how we perceive threats. This can heighten sensitivity to normal gut sensations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are real physiological responses. What the evidence is telling us is that focusing attention on the gut, coupled with anxiety about symptoms or repeated negative experiences with food, has real effects. This can 
sensitise how the gut interacts with the brain (known as the gut–brain axis) so normal digestive sensations are felt as pain or urgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognising this psychological contribution doesn’t mean symptoms are imagined. When the brain predicts a meal may cause harm, gut sensory pathways amplify every cramp or sensation of discomfort, creating genuine distress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This helps explain why people remain convinced gluten is to blame even when blinded studies show otherwise. Symptoms are real, but the mechanism is often driven by expectation rather than gluten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what else could explain why some people feel better after going gluten-free? Such a change in the diet also reduces &lt;a href="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/high-and-low-fodmap-foods/"&gt;high-FODMAP foods&lt;/a&gt; and ultra-processed products, encourages mindful eating and offers a sense of control. All these can improve our wellbeing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People also tend to eat more naturally gluten-free, nutrient-dense foods such as fruits, vegetables, legumes and nuts, which may further support gut health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The cost of going gluten-free&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2017.06.037"&gt;approximately 1% of the population&lt;/a&gt; with coeliac disease, avoiding gluten for life is essential. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for most who feel better gluten-free, gluten is unlikely to be the true problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also a cost to going gluten-free unnecessarily. Gluten-free foods are, on average, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2024.02.051"&gt;139% more expensive&lt;/a&gt; than standard ones. They are also often lower in fibre and key nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoiding gluten long term can also reduce diversity in your diet, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2018.03.017"&gt;alter your gut microbes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.14258"&gt;reinforce anxiety about eating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Is it worth getting tested?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike coeliac disease or a wheat allergy, non-coeliac gluten sensitivity has no biomarker – there’s no blood test or tissue marker that can confirm it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis instead relies on excluding other conditions and structured dietary testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on our review, we recommend clinicians:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;rule out coeliac disease and wheat allergy first&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;optimise the quality of someone’s overall diet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;trial a low-FODMAP diet if symptoms persist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;only then, consider a four to six-week dietitian-supervised gluten-free trial, followed by a structured re-introduction of gluten-containing foods to see whether gluten truly causes symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach keeps restriction targeted and temporary, avoiding unnecessary long-term exclusion of gluten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If gluten doesn’t explain someone’s symptoms, combining dietary guidance with psychological support often works best. That’s because expectation, stress and emotion influence our symptoms. Cognitive-behavioural or exposure-based therapies can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2014.01.007"&gt;reduce food-related fear&lt;/a&gt; and help people safely reintroduce foods they once avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This integrated model moves beyond the simplistic “gluten is bad” narrative toward personalised, evidence-based gut–brain care.&lt;/p&gt;

The other half were given a dummy drug, known as a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Previous analysis of the data found that semaglutide reduced the risk of major adverse cardiac events by 20%. Researchers have now found the benefit was apparent regardless of how much weight people lost while taking the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Academics said the findings suggested there were multiple ways the drug could benefit the heart, rather than the protective effect achieved solely by weight loss alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They found that even people who were only mildly overweight, with a body mass index (BMI) score of 27 – the average BMI score for UK adults – experienced similar benefits to those who had the highest BMI scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The benefits were also largely independent of how much weight people lost in the first four months of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, researchers did notice a difference between shrinking waistlines, measured by waist circumference, and heart benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01375-3/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Writing in the Lancet&lt;/a&gt;, they said that an “estimated 33% of the observed benefit on major adverse cardiovascular events was mediated through waist circumference reduction”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The lead author, Prof John Deanfield, of UCL’s Institute of Cardiovascular Science, said: “Abdominal fat is more dangerous for our cardiovascular health than overall weight and therefore it is not surprising to see a link between reduction in waist size and cardiovascular benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“However, this still leaves two-thirds of the heart benefits of semaglutide unexplained. These findings reframe what we think this medication is doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It is labelled as a weight-loss jab but its benefits for the heart are not directly related to the amount of weight lost – in fact, it is a drug that directly affects heart disease and other diseases of ageing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He added: “This work has implications for how semaglutide is used in clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“You don’t have to lose a lot of weight and you don’t need a high BMI to gain cardiovascular benefit. If your aim is to reduce cardiovascular disease, restricting its use to a limited time only and for those with the highest BMIs doesn’t make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“At the same time, the benefits need to be weighed against potential side-effects. Investigations of side-effects become especially important given the broad range of people this medicine and others like it could help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiywFBVV95cUxQdVZrendnOG9tUUJ0cDdNZVNwWnEweTZvSXo0NEpmVXpOSHh3S3FqOHBnckZRRUdXSTNuc0lqSnNINVJyU25TQ3hKYmxpUEgwekdzTGlnM2pudXJNSlQtdnRmUDBpaVV5MFV3UGhzeG5lT2hTQ1pzQ0docktyN2h0RnIwSExQbEhUNktkTzZjYUlRMzI3cVV6bUI5aVRKSHpkVG8yeGpuYnJ4Tl8zekV6dDBsdkpJdk52STV0aTNaYmhKYXBQMlVIMVA4Zw</guid></item><item><title>90 ％的美国人面临着他们从未听说过的疾病的风险-金钱谈话新闻</title><link>https://www.moneytalksnews.com/cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic-syndrome/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Money Talks News</author><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 20:58:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE1sQTlDbVFLOHRHMF9QTnBJYkR2MWdYcXdRNW1zVVBjSDB3dE45ZDlqUHdDenJOZnR2OFFRRUpLVEstUDk0Yl82WXY0bmFBV1dmTERualE4OTZXX1ZrVWFCcENoYXk1TEpzdTN1R0ZCTTh4TXlXWm1PNkpsZDk</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，牙龈疾病可能与中风和脑损伤的风险增加有关- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gum-disease-increased-risk-stroke-brain-damage-study/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keeping your mouth healthy may help keep your heart and brain healthy too, according to new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WN9.0000000000000037" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday in Neurology Open Access, researchers found adults with gum disease may be more likely to have signs of damage to the brain's white matter than people without gum disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gum disease is associated with a higher chance of inflammation, and inflammation has been tied to atherosclerosis as well as hardening of the small blood vessels, as we saw in this study," study author Dr. Souvik Sen told CBS News. Arteriosclerosis is a disease that causes abnormal thickening of the artery walls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WN9.0000000000000036" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; led by Sen and published in the same journal Wednesday, researchers found having both gum disease and cavities is linked to an 86% increased risk of stroke compared to people with healthy mouths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What the study suggested was that if you have cavities on top of gum disease, it is double trouble. It means your risk of stroke or adverse heart event doubles," Sen said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, if someone takes care of their mouth — including brushing, flossing and regular dentist visits for preventative cleaning — risk decreases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their risk of having a stroke dropped by as much as 81%, which is a very big finding," Sen said of the research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research just shows an association, so it does not prove that poor oral health causes strokes — but these findings add to growing evidence that oral health may have a significant impact on cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/18-11-2022-who-highlights-oral-health-neglect-affecting-nearly-half-of-the-world-s-population" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;3.5 billion people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide suffering from gum disease or cavities, according to the World Health Organization, researchers say prevention and treatment could be an important part of stroke prevention. According to the American Heart Association, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/data-research/facts-stats/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;more than 795,000 people&lt;/a&gt; have a stroke each year in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Antidepressants, medications used to treat depression, anxiety and other health conditions, can cause a wide range of physiological side effects depending on which one you take, according to a new study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, published Tuesday in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2825%2901293-0/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;, researchers analyzed more than 58,000 participants to compare 30 antidepressants with a placebo for an average of eight weeks, finding "clinically significant" differences between the drugs' effect on blood flow and metabolism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The differences noted in the study include weight change, heart rate, blood pressure and total cholesterol.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For weight change, researchers found some antidepressants, including maprotiline and amitriptyline, were associated with weight gain in almost half of participants — about a 4-pound average increase with maprotiline, for example. However, other drugs, such as agomelatine, were associated with weight loss in 55% of patients who lost approximately 5.5 pounds on average. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For heart rate, some drugs caused increases — like a 14 beats-per-minute increase on average for nortriptyline — while others caused decreases, such as an average decrease of 8 beats-per-minute for fluvoxamine.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kidney and liver function, electrolyte levels and heart rhythm were not majorly effected by most antidepressants, according to the study.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings should not deter people from taking antidepressants, which remain effective treatments, the study's authors write, but instead should highlight the need for better tailoring of treatments to best fit a patient's health and preferences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do know that these medications are life-saving and life-changing, but they can have variation from person to person depending on a person's metabolism, their age (and) what other medications they're on," psychiatrist Dr. Sue Varma, who was not involved in the study, said on "CBS Mornings Plus" Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Untreated depression also can cause the side effects explored in the study, including weight gain or loss, Varma added, making it important to "weigh the risks and the benefits" of medications.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She suggests doctors make it clear to patients that antidepressants can potentially exacerbate underlying conditions like elevated cholesterol or diabetes, make a plan to monitor side effects carefully and provide an array of lifestyle interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's not cause panic, but these medications do have really important side effects," Varma said.  &lt;/p&gt;

A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8996025/"&gt;2021 study published in &lt;em&gt;Sleep&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; taking into account roughly 4,000 people backs this up, showing that participants who supplemented with magnesium experienced higher quality sleep than participants who didn’t supplement with magnesium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7 magnesium-rich foods worth adding to your diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, it’s best to get magnesium through diet versus supplements because you’ll be consuming other important nutrients at the same time. The magnesium-rich foods included here all have other nutrients that either support sleep, mood, or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;1. Pumpkin seeds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pumpkin seeds top both Pratt and Dryden’s lists for the best magnesium-rich foods for better mood and sleep. &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/"&gt;It has more magnesium than any other food&lt;/a&gt;, with 156 milligrams per serving, or 37% of the recommended daily value. “Pumpkin seeds also contain tryptophan, which is an amino acid that’s important for relaxation and sleep,” Dryden says. If you don’t plan on carving any pumpkins this fall, pumpkin seeds are easy to find at most grocery stores. They make a nice, crunchy topper for salads, oatmeal, or yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;2. Chia seeds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another seed that’s high in magnesium is chia seeds. “Two tablespoons of chia seeds is going to give you a pretty decent amount of magnesium,” Dryden says. Besides magnesium, she says that these tiny seeds are also high in omega-3 fatty acids, which are important for brain function and decreasing inflammation—both important for avoiding depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;3. Leafy greens&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One magnesium-rich food Kriegler recommends is leafy greens because it’s super versatile and high in many other important nutrients, including &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/high-fiber-diet-2"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;. You probably already know how important fiber is for gut health. Due to the strong connection between &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/gut-health"&gt;gut health and brain health&lt;/a&gt;, a thriving microbiome is crucial for mood regulation.

To the untrained eye, they basically look the same as what you’d expect a sauna to look like—wood paneling, benches, some guy who just had to bring his phone inside—and both actually share a bunch of the same health benefits. But why does every gym, wellness club, and boutique &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-to-get-the-benefits-of-hiit-workouts-without-burning-out"&gt;HIIT workout&lt;/a&gt; studio suddenly seem to have these new-wave sweat boxes in their &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/gq-125-rules-for-modern-gentlemen-manners-etiquette-guide"&gt;locker rooms&lt;/a&gt;? For one, it’s a matter of practicality. Infrared saunas give off way less heat, thus making the surrounding area a much more habitable place for those who’d prefer not to partake. But, more importantly, the wellness industry loves a shiny new thing—especially one that conveniently doesn’t give club members the tools to burn down the building. And, as it turns out, infrared saunas actually have some unique benefits of their own. (For one, they’re less likely to overheat your iPhone, not that we’d know anything about that.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrared vs. traditional sauna: What’s the difference?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, there are several variations of saunas, but they mostly tend to get lumped into two categories: traditional and infrared. A true traditional sauna, also called a Finnish sauna, uses a wood fire to heat stones, which in turn heat the air inside the sauna. Nowadays, you can also find electric saunas (these tend to get filed under “traditional”), which also use stones, but the stones are heated by electricity rather than fire. Traditional saunas can maintain temperatures between 150-220 degrees Fahrenheit. “These typically operate at higher temperatures with dry heat, inducing intense sweating,” says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.beverlyhillscardiovascular.com/dr-setareh-bio/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.beverlyhillscardiovascular.com/dr-setareh-bio/"}' href="https://www.beverlyhillscardiovascular.com/dr-setareh-bio/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sam Setareh, MD, MS&lt;/a&gt;, director of clinical cardiology at Beverly Hills Cardiovascular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional saunas, Infrared saunas do not have a central heat source. Instead, they utilize ceramic or metallic panels to emit far-infrared light. “An infrared sauna uses infrared light to directly heat your body, rather than heating the air around you like a traditional sauna,” Dr. Setareh says. Hence, infrared saunas are able to operate at much lower temperatures—between 100–165 degrees—while still giving you a similar, albeit decidedly less intense, sensation to sitting in a traditional sauna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Setareh, “both types of saunas share common benefits—like improving circulation, promoting relaxation, and encouraging recovery,” and studies have also found both to have positive effects on lowering &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/apple-watchs-new-hypertension-feature-could-save-your-life"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;. That said, there are some important differences that may influence which type of sauna is ultimately best for your goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traditional saunas seem to be better for cardiovascular health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research, including a landmark 2015 Finnish &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2130724"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that surveyed 2,315 men over the course of two decades, has long associated sauna use with heart health and a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. But it wasn’t until a recent &lt;a data-offer-url="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpregu.00012.2025" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpregu.00012.2025"}' href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpregu.00012.2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published earlier this year in the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Physiology,&lt;/em&gt; that researchers have formally begun weighing the benefits of traditional saunas against their infrared counterparts. (This latest study also compared both types of sauna to a hot tub, which surprisingly emerged as &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/are-hot-tubs-actually-better-for-you-than-saunas#:~:text=Traditional%20saunas%20are%20usually%20heated,at%20just%20over%20100%20degrees."&gt;the most beneficial of the three&lt;/a&gt; when it came to promoting heart health.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The bottom line is that the far-infrared sauna, by far, showed the least [noticeable] rise in core body temperature—and therefore had the least cardiovascular impact,” says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://cas.uoregon.edu/directory/human-physiology/all/minson" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://cas.uoregon.edu/directory/human-physiology/all/minson"}' href="https://cas.uoregon.edu/directory/human-physiology/all/minson" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Christopher T.

Yet despite how many people have them, most don't know the most common hemorrhoids symptoms and may be missing out on the treatment they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;a href="https://mdmercy.com/find-a-doctor/jeffery-nelson-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jeffery Nelson, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jeffery Nelson, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a colorectal surgeon and surgical director of The Center for Inflammatory Bowel and Colorectal Diseases at Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore; &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/198965-rudolph-albert-bedford" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rudolph Bedford, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Rudolph Bedford, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, digestive health experts reveal everything you need to know about hemorrhoids, including why they form, the most common symptoms, and what you can do to get rid of them and find relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are hemorrhoids, exactly?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hemorrhoids, also called piles, are swollen, inflamed veins around the anus or lower rectum, according to the &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/hemorrhoids.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:U.S. National Library of Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;U.S. National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; (NLM). “Hemorrhoids are normal anatomy, like having hands,” said &lt;a href="https://mdmercy.com/find-a-doctor/jeffery-nelson-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jeffery Nelson, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jeffery Nelson, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a colorectal surgeon and surgical director of The Center for Inflammatory Bowel and Colorectal Diseases at Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore. “Everyone has hemorrhoidal tissue.” The defining factor is whether the tissue is inflamed, which is what causes the unpleasant symptoms that need to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two types: Internal hemorrhoids form in the lining of the anus and lower rectum, while external hemorrhoids form under the skin around the anus, per the NIDDK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Causes of hemorrhoids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear why some people struggle with hemorrhoids and others don’t, Dr. Nelson said. “But there can be a genetic component to it,” meaning it can run in families. There are a few things that may also up your risk of developing hemorrhoids, the &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/hemorrhoids/symptoms-causes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NIDDK;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NIDDK&lt;/a&gt; says, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;straining to poop&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;sitting on the toilet for long periods of time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;having chronic constipation or diarrhea&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;eating a low-fiber diet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;weakening of the supporting tissues in your anus and rectum that happens with aging&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;pregnancy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;regularly lifting heavy objects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common symptoms of hemorrhoids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The symptoms you experience will depend on the type of hemorrhoids you have, Dr. Nelson said. If you have &lt;strong&gt;external hemorrhoids&lt;/strong&gt;, you’ll probably have the following symptoms, per the NLM:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;anal itching&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;one or more hard, tender lumps near your anus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;anal aches or pain that you feel or gets worse when you sit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have &lt;strong&gt;internal hemorrhoids&lt;/strong&gt;, you’ll likely have these symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;bleeding from your rectum (which shows up as bright red blood in your poop, on toilet paper, or in the toilet bowl after you poop)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a hemorrhoid that has fallen through your anus, which is called prolapse&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hemorrhoids, for the most part, do not cause pain when you have a bowel movement,” said &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/198965-rudolph-albert-bedford" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rudolph Bedford, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Rudolph Bedford, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. However, if you have a prolapsed hemorrhoid, you can also experience swelling and pain if it doesn’t go back inside your body, Dr. Nelson said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best ways to get rid of hemorrhoids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few remedies you can try to treat hemorrhoids at home, Dr. Bedford said. First, eating a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g65893093/high-fiber-recipes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high-fiber diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;high-fiber diet&lt;/a&gt;, exercising regularly, and drinking plenty of liquids can help make your poop softer and move it along more easily, so it doesn’t cause extra irritation to your hemorrhoids. Avoiding sitting for long periods of time can also minimize discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a sitz bath for 20 minutes a night for a week or two will also help keep the anal area clean, reduce inflammation, and generally make you feel more comfortable, per the &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/hemorrhoids/treatment" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NIDDK;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NIDDK&lt;/a&gt;. Simply sit in a bathtub filled with 3 to 4 inches of warm water or buy a plastic tub that holds the water and fits over your toilet seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re still having trouble, there are over-the-counter hemorrhoid creams and ointments that can help, like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Preparation-Hemorrhoid-Treatment-Ointment-Discomfort/dp/B07PQY3F3S/?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.69120568%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Preparation H;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Preparation H&lt;/a&gt;. “These can help decrease inflammation and help shrivel up or shrink hemorrhoids,” Dr. Bedford said. If that doesn’t do the trick, your doctor may recommend a prescription cream or suppository to try to fix the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When to see a doctor about your hemorrhoids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re ever concerned about your hemorrhoids or you’re not sure what’s happening down there, you should call your doctor, Dr. Nelson said, especially if you’ve had symptoms for more than a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your doctor will likely recommend that you use medication or at-home remedies first but, if that doesn’t help, the &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/hemorrhoids/treatment" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NIDDK;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NIDDK&lt;/a&gt; says there are other treatment options available. These include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rubber band ligation&lt;/strong&gt;, where a doctor essentially cuts off the blood supply to a bleeding or prolapsed internal hemorrhoid with a rubber band so that the hemorrhoid shrivels and falls off&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sclerotherapy&lt;/strong&gt;, in which a doctor injects a solution into an internal hemorrhoid, causing scar tissue to form that cuts off the blood supply and shrinks the hemorrhoid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrared photocoagulation&lt;/strong&gt;, which uses infrared light to form scar tissue on an internal hemorrhoid, cutting off the blood supply and shrinking the hemorrhoid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electrocoagulation&lt;/strong&gt;, which sends an electric current into an internal hemorrhoid to form scar tissue, cut off the blood supply and shrink the hemorrhoid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surgical removal&lt;/strong&gt;, which may be used in more severe cases on large external hemorrhoids and prolapsing internal hemorrhoids&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 16:48:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNVUMtaG1LQS1OS3Jwd2hzaENpdzZxbjhZRXItTnQ5Y3VqYTk2aXN5ZnVMd1RsemVXWEpkRENMTlBJVGNwWUp2QmhqZldtWWdpWFllR1pJQWlxb004cWpBNWdDVm1fUkJBRTdyY2hJekF4cEItenBON3h3anV1dTg4cXY2amNVUlBYSEE</guid></item><item><title>我以为我只是抑郁...但医生诊断我患有世界上最致命的疾病-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15216819/depressed-tuberculosis-deadliest-lung-disease.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A woman suffering from crippling &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-628cf340-af59-11f0-beb6-1b3d6930e422"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and anxiety was found to have the world's deadliest disease ravaging her entire body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 43-year-old from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/massachusetts/index.html" id="mol-62949460-af59-11f0-beb6-1b3d6930e422"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; was admitted to the psychiatric ward at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital with severe depression and plans to commit suicide by overdosing on medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She had several severe stressors in her life, including bipolar disorder, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/domestic-violence/index.html" id="mol-628d4160-af59-11f0-beb6-1b3d6930e422"&gt;domestic violence&lt;/a&gt;, financial troubles and limited access to stable housing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she also had spent the past two months suffering from a dry, hacking cough. Throughout her hospital stay, her breathing and oxygen levels increasingly worsened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;X-ray scans showed several small nodules spread across the woman's lungs, a sign of bacteria. In additional scans, doctors found the lesions in the liver, lymph nodes, pancreas and brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After nine weeks, biopsies and bacterial samples came back positive for mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that causes tuberculosis, &lt;span&gt;a respiratory condition &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15082229/maps-reveal-deadliest-disease-tuberculosis-concerning-rise.html"&gt;dubbed the deadliest disease on the planet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; due to resistance to certain antibiotics and increased spread in developing countries that lack modern antibiotics. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Though rare in the US today, affecting just a few thousand Americans every year, tuberculosis most often strikes people with weakened immune systems, those living in prisons or homeless shelters and people born in countries with higher rates of the disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The anonymous woman had been diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/hiv_aids/index.html" id="mol-628e2bc0-af59-11f0-beb6-1b3d6930e422"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt;) 17 years earlier and had limited access to her medications for two years leading up to her emergency room visit, which could have made her vulnerable to TB, doctors treating her &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2412536?logout=true#sec-4"&gt;wrote in a medical journal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An unidentified woman visited Massachusetts General Hospital with depression, suicidal thoughts and persistent dry cough. She was diagnosed with tuberculosis that had spread to multiple organs, including her brain (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above x-ray scan shows nodules in the woman's lungs from tuberculosis &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also regularly smoked crack cocaine, as well as a pack of cigarettes every day and drank alcohol frequently, all of which may have damaged her lungs and kept her immune system from fighting off the bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The woman was found to have disseminated tuberculosis, a severe form of the disease that strikes multiple organs, including her brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacteria may have triggered inflammation and reduced production of the amino acid tryptophan, which is crucial for producing mood-boosting serotonin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though she had significant stressors in her life, doctors suggested the TB may have exacerbated her mental health issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Today, TB infects a few thousand Americans every year and kills about 500, far fewer than cancer, heart disease and dementia. The threat is much more prevalent in developing countries, however, and TB kills 1.2million people worldwide each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;TB in the US was on a steady decline from 1993 until 2020, when the overall number of cases hit an all-time low of 7,170. But in 2021, that number jumped to 7,866.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prevalence has gone up every year since. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest CDC data shows the US provisionally recorded 10,347 TB cases in 2024 - up eight percent from the year before and the highest tally since 2011, when there were 10,471 cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above scans show nodules in several of the woman's organs. Image A is a scan of her lungs, with arrows pointing toward the nodules. Image B shows an arrow pointing toward an enlarged lymph node. Image C shows arrows drawing attention to nodules in the liver and head of the pancreas, and Image D shows a nodule in the woman's brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases are now on the rise in 80 percent of US states, which experts have blamed missed cases and distrust of doctors forged by the Covid pandemic.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The demographics of TB have also shifted, starting in 2001. That was the first year the CDC reported more non-US born citizen patients than US-born, meaning immigrants and travelers were the driving force behind infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;TB spreads through airborne droplets that are released into the air when a person with active TB coughs, sneezes or speaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the early stages, symptoms include a persistent and unexplained cough, sometimes coughing up blood or chest pain. Patients may also suffer from unexplained weight loss, loss of appetite, fever and night sweats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In later stages, patients may have severe breathing difficulties and extensive lung damage, and the infection may spread to other organs or the back, causing pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deaths are most often due to respiratory failure caused by bacterial damage to the lungs. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in cases like the woman's, TB in the brain can damage vital tissues and increase pressure in the skull, causing nerve cells to die off. Eventually, this can lead paralysis and strokes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tuberculosis can be prevented with the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine. Though, due to the generally low risk, it is not routinely offered in the US, except for to children regularly exposed to people with active TB or healthcare workers in areas with increased spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The woman in the case report spent 33 days in the hospital receiving antibiotics and steroids for the TB and antiretrovirals, which reduce the viral load from HIV. She was discharged to a medical facility for homeless people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three months later, she was hospitalized again for depression and suicidal ideation due to housing concerns and has since completed antituberculosis treatments again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is recovering from drug addiction as well.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Certain cancers are becoming a bigger problem for just about everyone. New research shows cases of several obesity-related cancers have been rising across the globe and across different age groups.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists in the UK examined cancer surveillance data spanning 15 years from dozens of countries, including the U.S. They found that, in most countries, several cancer types had increased in both younger and older adults, all of which are linked to obesity. The findings suggest that the surge in cancer cases seen recently isn’t just limited to the young, as some past research and media reports have highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A widespread rise&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Numerous studies have spotted a rise in specific cancers among the young. Earlier this summer, for instance, Dana-Farber researchers &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/gastrointestinal-cancers-are-surging-among-younger-americans-2000631264"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; a steady increase of gastrointestinal cancers in Americans under the age of 50, dating back over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers behind this current study wanted to take a more expansive look at recent cancer trends, however, both internationally and across the lifespan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They analyzed data on annually reported cancer cases between 2003 and 2017 from 42 countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, North and South America, and Australia. They focused specifically on 13 types of cancer that past studies have shown may be increasing in young adults.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In most of the countries, the researchers found a clear rise in 6 cancer types among adults under the age of 50 during those years: thyroid cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, kidney cancer, endometrial cancer, and leukemia. But they also found a similar increase in new cases among older adults for five of these cancers. The sole exception was colorectal cancer; an increase of these cases in older adults was only seen in half the countries, and the rate of this increase was generally larger in younger adults.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, rates of liver, oral, esophageal, and stomach cancer also actually decreased for younger people in more than half the countries studied.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What this means for cancer prevention&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings, &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-02718"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, don’t mean that the reported cancer rise in young adults has been a mirage. But it does complicate things.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;If cancer cases are generally rising across age groups, for instance, that suggests risk factors common to most everyone are to blame, rather than something only affecting young adults. That’s important to know, since scientists and health organizations might otherwise focus only on studying or trying to reverse this rise in young people. Notably, all of the cancer types that might be increasing in both younger and older adults are linked to obesity—a condition that has become more prevalent throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These findings can help inform future research and clinical and public health guidelines,” the authors wrote in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;At the same time, the still apparent difference in colorectal cancer trends points to unique health risks that younger people might be facing. Some research has &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/scientists-may-have-figured-out-why-young-people-are-getting-colorectal-cancer-more-often-2000594349"&gt;indicated&lt;/a&gt; that younger people could be getting exposed more to certain gastrointestinal infections, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh25ocoy004z3b7990ga40y7@published"&gt;I can’t stop feeling insecure about how much I must smell and how gross I am after an intense workout. But according to her, she loves it and it drives her wild. I really want to believe her, but it’s hard to trust that someone could enjoy the smells of body odor and sweat. Is there a way I can let loose and enjoy this more? Or should I just put a stop to the post-gym second workout?&lt;/p&gt;

Not all BO and sweat are made alike, and if the sweat isn’t fresh (and, for example, dries on clothes that aren’t removed or, worse, reworn), it can smell sour. But good BO can be &lt;em&gt;so good&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh22sg7h00163b79jlc8871x@published"&gt;Your girlfriend is hardly alone. In fact, there’s a gay party in New York called &lt;a href="https://pheromonenyc.com/"&gt;Pheromone&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/09/style/this-party-stinks-thats-the-point.html"&gt;caters to&lt;/a&gt; guys who want to stick their noses in each other’s pits. Read up a little more on this kink, and it may be easier to understand that, yeah, some people like this a lot. It requires very little of you to allow your girlfriend to indulge (merely raising an arm, if that), and if you can be comfortable with that, you should. She’s expressed how into it she is—believe her.&lt;/p&gt;

In the United States, we’re generally taught to scrub away our natural odors, and that can ingrain in us a sense that we smell bad. There may be no getting around this for you. With the knowledge that what your girlfriend is asking for is highly common, see if you can just relax and let her do her thing with your post-workout body. If you find yourself unable to get into it or with lingering discomfort, maybe you don’t rock full post-workout funk. Maybe you let her enjoy you in the morning, before you’ve showered or put on deodorant. Or at the end of the day, when your deodorant has run out. Test your own boundaries of comfort. If you ultimately conclude that any amount of funk is too much for you to unleash, that’s totally OK.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh23nrzw002t3b791b095k1z@published"&gt;When I married my husband 20 years ago, he was handsome, tall, witty, and athletic. Well, he’s still tall, witty, and cute. But time is beginning to catch up with him. His hair is thinning, and he’s not as slim and fit as he used to be. Basically, he’s aging. And I’m afraid I don’t find him as attractive as I did before. For that reason, I’ve been making excuses, and our sex life has been lacking lately. I’m just not as attracted to him as I used to be.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh23nrzy002u3b79rw01to5w@published"&gt;I know this sounds shallow. I’m also aging, and what’s worse, men often trade their wives for younger models. I don’t want to trade my husband for a younger man, but is there anything I can do to feel more attracted to him as he (and I) keep getting older? I love this guy. I don’t want to leave him just because he has a little less hair and can’t fit into ultra-tight leather trousers anymore, but I never thought I’d have to wonder how to stay physically attracted to your aging spouse. How do people do this?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="150" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh23nrzz002x3b79qlp0sdyo@published"&gt;Usually, when this issue comes up, at least in this column, it presents with less specificity. People feel less compelled to have sex with a long-term partner for reasons that they often can’t quite spell out. The spark is gone, sex is less exciting. It’s hard to even muster the effort to qualify “blah,” because, well, that’s blah for you. In those cases, usually my advice is to apply Esther Perel’s methods of creating eroticizing distance in your relationship, as detailed in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mating-Captivity-Unlocking-Erotic-Intelligence-ebook/dp/B000UODXP0/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1ORNN2XAXU0CZ&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.bXIETwz6rg35EJfbpa4eyUiUlcEoJVKlMs9LiYHOqblAJzKIemTav2l00ugUSJJW7ORQlh-We27SCj6Lwk9lviXae-tZ4B6u-YU5GEfHTPQqVV-LlBAHezu-SlAbgecF9IKKzRf950upYZbF7_o91Y0PEDCoN6BjPoO3w7cJkmNOCMb9wb_ZPbDVJPpAO6DWBxVv-1KOUCgfE8nv5fpogL7Gxntk4J0m657sQ6boPB0.fubgQNBPTZ1szWcsr9vCQZ16tiGwdRVyPqj7xpkTABY&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=mating+in+captivity+esther+perel&amp;amp;qid=1760910376&amp;amp;sprefix=mating+in+captiv,aps,120&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mating in Captivity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is to shake yourselves out of routine by, for example, changing venues (via a weekly hotel sex date, for example) or erotic letters. Seeing an old partner with new eyes can make sex more exciting. You may want to try something like this (or at least read Perel&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;for more ideas and to think about whether they could even apply to your situation).&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="178" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh23nrzz002y3b79nmj6y4pz@published"&gt;But if this is an issue with type (i.e., you’re into people who are younger than your husband), what can you do? You like what you like. You may want to play with the idea of sensation/exploration to help bring you in—if there is stuff you haven’t tried but want to, like toys, kink, or groups, that might be a way to recharge things. You could also kind of do an anti-Perel and focus on sex as not a carnal way to get your rocks off, but as an expression of love and appreciation for this person who has been by your side for 20 years. That might not be so exciting, but it could at least give you an attainable goal. If nothing here works, consider counseling—either solo or couples. The latter could, of course, require you to be honest about your lessened attraction to your husband, which might be hard. But a third party’s help regaining it or at least relearning how to find sex exciting with your partner might make the momentary awkwardness worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="61" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh23ns0100303b79mfmpuf0w@published"&gt;My husband, who is 63, and I, a 58-year-old woman, have been married for 39 years. We were married young, but all was well. In his early 30s, our sex life changed, and we started having more time between having sex. He was very into his hobbies, and at times, I felt left out since I was home with our daughters.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="108" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh23ns0100313b7979jfr2g0@published"&gt;Fast forward through his 30s to 50s, and there would be months between intimacy. I’m almost 10 years younger and still wanted to be with him. I love him very deeply, and I know he loves me. But he just doesn’t seem interested in me. This has harmed my self-esteem greatly. Time moved forward, and he began to have erectile dysfunction issues. I begged him to go to the doctor. He finally did and received medication. He tried them once, and that was it. They either didn’t work or it’s me that’s the problem. I cannot remember the last time we had sex, but it has been years.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="106" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh23ns0200323b79g84uhjho@published"&gt;As expected, we’ve grown apart in multiple ways. Politically, he has become far more conservative, and I’ve become more liberal. This applies since it is one more division and one less thing we can discuss together. About 15 years ago, we went to therapy. He was fine with the two of us together. I don’t know what happened in his one time in individual therapy, but our therapist stated to me in my next session that I should divorce him, which seemed a surprising statement to me. I didn’t act on that because frankly, that’s not how we were raised. He will not go back to therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="129" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh23ns0300363b79mtgqyo0y@published"&gt;It’s never too late for a divorce. If your concern is about restarting your life and finding another partner, realize that people can and do find love at any age. Besides, if that is what’s preoccupying you, you’re looking way into the future when you should be concentrated on your immediate situation. Forget how you were raised (easier said than done, I know)—why stay in something if it’s not serving you? Do you want to spend the rest of your life in a situation that you find sexually frustrating with someone whom you seem to be drifting further and further away from? If you do, you don’t have much of a shot at finding new love, at least not ethically. If you leave, you open your world to chance.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="221" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh23ns0300373b79y4kombw5@published"&gt;I’m not saying that your letter reads like the only way for you to be happy is to divorce. I’m an optimist, and I know that even seemingly desperate situations can be turned around. I believe in the power of love. But some things concern me here. There seems to be a communication breakdown between you and your husband. He got ED meds, they didn’t work, and why seems to be a mystery. From that, I infer that he talked little about what was actually going on with him. The thing about PDE5 inhibitors is that they don’t tend to be effective &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pde5-inhibitors#sildenafil-viagra"&gt;without a will to have sex&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., horniness). They facilitate blood flow, but something needs to get the blood flowing. This does not mean that the problem is you (though it certainly could be that your husband isn’t attracted to you—I don’t want to sugarcoat this and dismiss that possibility entirely). It could also have something to do with him physically (a hormonal issue, for example) or sexually (perhaps he has a fetish that is not being catered to, or it could have something to do with his sexuality, like maybe he’s asexual). We don’t know because he’s not saying, and maybe part of why he’s not saying is that he’s not investigating. Shame could also be a factor.&lt;/p&gt;

That entire interaction sounds strange to me. When you write that he will not go back to therapy, I am assuming that the situation turned him off therapy altogether, including couples therapy. If that is not the case, find a different couples therapist and go. If it is, what can you do? You can’t make him get the help that your relationship greatly needs. Having a discussion in which you state that you are considering separation/divorce might help him see the gravity of the situation. It seems that might be one of the few tools that you have left. Consider using it.&lt;/p&gt;

The chart review for this study involved three groups of patients: (1) patients with tumour biopsies confirming stage III or stage IV NSCLC between January 2017 and September 2022; (2) patients with melanoma of any stage who received single- or multi-agent immune checkpoint blockade between January 2019 and December 2022; and (3) a tissue-agnostic cohort, which included all patients with pathology results for PD-L1 from January 2020 to October 2023 at our institution across a wide range of histologies. This study was approved by the MD Anderson Cancer Center institutional review board. Informed consent was waived due to the retrospective and de-identified nature of the data. The data-collection cut-off was 1 September 2024; data analysis was performed from 1 September 2024 to 29 July 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the NSCLC dataset, patient information was collected regarding patient demographics (such as age at immunotherapy start, sex, ethnicity), primary tumour histology, clinical stage, known tumour mutations (such as those in EGFR, KRAS, HER2, ALK, MET, p53 and RET), metastatic burden at immunotherapy start (brain, liver), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS; range, 0–5) near the initiation of immunotherapy, radiation therapy in the time around immunotherapy start, chemotherapy history, immunodeficiency, comorbidities (heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease, respiratory disease), history of other primary tumours, steroid use around immunotherapy initiation, date of last follow-up, date of death, date of first recurrence or progression, ICI agent names and start dates, COVID-19, influenza and pneumococcal vaccination dates, and TPS. Recorded PD-L1 expression as reported below was required for inclusion in the survival analysis for NSCLC. For patients with multiple biopsies, the PD-L1 expression recorded from the closest biopsy to ICI start was used for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the melanoma dataset, patient information was collected regarding patient demographics (including age at immunotherapy start, sex, ethnicity), primary tumour histology, clinical stage, known tumour mutations (such as those in EGFR, KRAS, HER2, ALK, MET, p53 and RET), metastatic burden at immunotherapy start (for example, brain, liver), PS (range, 0–5) at the initiation of immunotherapy, chemotherapy history, immunodeficiency, comorbidities (for example, heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease, respiratory disease), other primary tumour data, steroid use around COVID-19 vaccination and immunotherapy initiation, date of last follow-up, date of death, date of first recurrence/progression, ICI agent names and start dates, and COVID-19 vaccination dates. Although our dataset did not include specific vaccine formulations administered to each patient, vaccine formulations administered during the study period included the original monovalent mRNA-1273 vaccine from Moderna (100 µg mRNA prime, 50 µg mRNA booster) released on 18 December 2020; the bivalent Moderna vaccine targeting the original strain and Omicron BA.4/BA.5 (50 µg mRNA) released on 1 September 2022; the original monovalent vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech (30 µg mRNA prime and booster) released on 11 December 2020; and the Pfizer/BioNTech bivalent formulation (30 µg mRNA) released on 31 August 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients were separated into two groups: (1) patients who received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccination within 100 days of ICI start; and (2) patients who did not receive a COVID-19 vaccination. Survival analysis was performed using these groups, with subanalysis involving staging of the tumour, brand of mRNA vaccine, number of doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, location of metastases and cycle of immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For patients who received COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in both the NSCLC and melanoma datasets, OS was calculated as the time between the date of immunotherapy start closest to the mRNA vaccination date, and the last follow-up date or date of death. For patients who did not receive COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, OS was calculated as the time between the initiation of their first ICI start and the date of death or last follow-up. For patients who received COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, PFS was calculated as the time between the initiation of ICI closest to mRNA vaccination and the first incidence of either pathology-confirmed recurrence or imaging-confirmed progression, whichever occurred earlier, that was declared progression in their primary medical oncologist’s clinical notes. For patients who did not receive COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, PFS was calculated as the time between their first ICI start date and clinician-confirmed progression as described above. Patients who progressed before the receipt of mRNA vaccination were included in the vaccination group for this analysis. Kaplan–Meier curves were generated using GraphPad Prism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec14"&gt;Cox proportional hazards regression&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Cox proportional hazards regression, time-dependent variables were defined as described in the figure captions. Continuous/numbered variables (such as age, BMI, PD-L1 expression, ECOG and treatment year) were retained as numeric. Binary and categorical variables (for example, stage, gender, mutational status, comorbidities) were converted into factors. For each variable, we constructed individual Cox proportional hazards models. HRs, 95% CIs (Wald) and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were extracted from model summaries. Variables with &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 in univariable analysis were considered for multivariable modelling. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regressions were similarly generated with significant variables from univariable analysis. For multivariable Cox proportional hazards regressions, patients with missing values were excluded from analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Categories with fewer than five cases are reported for completeness but were considered not statistically meaningful due to convergence and insufficient data for reliable inference. Variables with significant relationships with survival were included in multivariable analyses (MVAs), and those significant after MVA (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) were included in PSM. Certain variables (for example, steroid use within 1 month of vaccine) represented subgroups of the treatment cohort by definition. These were evaluated descriptively and in univariable models but were not included as covariables in MVAs, as they do not represent baseline confounders and were not significant on univariable analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We assessed the proportional hazards assumption in multivariate models by evaluating Schoenfeld residuals and found no major violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec15"&gt;Imputation and PSM&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small number of patients in the NSCLC dataset did not have documented ECOG scores, which were an important predictor of outcomes in Cox proportional hazards regression. BMI had missingness in initial univariable analyses but, because it was not required for PSM, imputation was not performed to address the missingness. Multivariable logistic regression and ridge regression were used to evaluate associations between ECOG missingness and clinically relevant pretreatment covariables. Ridge regression was selected due to multicollinearity between important variables that could not be excluded from the model. Variables not included in models predicting ECOG missingness were vaccination status, steroid usage within a timeframe of vaccination or ICI, PD-L1, concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy agent and BMI (as mentioned above). Subsequent ridge regression analysis suggested that ECOG scores in this analysis had a high probability of exhibiting missingness at random.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the small sample size in the stage III NSCLC dataset treatment group, multiple imputation was performed to estimate missing ECOG values using chained equations and the R package MICE, where predictive mean matching (PMM) (with set.seed(2025)) was used to create five imputed datasets. Variables used for imputation were chosen based on large absolute ridge regression coefficients (|&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;| &amp;gt; 0.3) and clinical relevance to ensure that prediction of ECOG missingness occurred with accuracy. After selection using regression coefficients, age and previous cycles of systemic therapy were included due to clinical importance. To facilitate PSM while maintaining power in patients with stage III NSCLC, the mode of the five imputed ECOG values was used as a single value for each patient (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 5). This approach was necessary to minimize variance inflation and avoid diluting treatment effects in a very small sample. As PMM is random, small deviations in variable definition, factor levels and row ordering may result in slightly different imputed values. However, sensitivity analyses with slightly different mode selection in the case of ties, different seeds and an increased number of datasets (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20 or &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 10 rather than &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 5) revealed similar outcomes (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) after subsequent matching. The plausibility of imputed values was assessed using density plots, which demonstrated appropriate range and overlap between observed and imputed ECOG values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After imputation, PSM was performed using the R MatchIt package. A logistic regression model was used to estimate propensity scores, predicting treatment assignment of ‘vaccine within 100 days’ or ‘no vaccine’ with covariables based on significant factors associated with survival from MVA, including original or imputed ECOG scores. Across all propensity score analyses, nearest-neighbour matching was performed on the previously estimated propensity scores to identify a balanced cohort. In the case of stage III unresectable NSCLC PSM, nearest-neighbour PSM was performed with a caliper of 0.1 and a 2:1 ratio of control patients to treated patients in stage III UR NSCLC to improve covariable balance and maximize statistical power. Sensitivity analysis with removal of ECOG from the PSM model revealed similar trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In stage IV NSCLC, patients with missing ECOG were excluded due to sufficient remaining sample size. PSM was once again performed with nearest-neighbour matching, with a caliper of 0.1 and a 1:1 ratio of control patients to treated patients. Sensitivity analyses with removal of ECOG from PSM rather than imputation and with the same methods as reported in stage III NSCLC (with the same caliper of 0.1 but with a ratio of 1:1 rather than 2:1) also each revealed statistically significant results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No imputation was performed in the melanoma cohort due to completeness of variables. The melanoma PSM analyses were run with nearest-neighbour matching with a caliper of 0.1 and a 1:1 ratio of control patients to treated patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all matched cohorts, absolute standardized mean differences (|SMD|) of pscores were consistently less than 0.05 after matching, indicating excellent balance between groups. Balance diagnostics were confirmed visually using jitter plots and histograms of propensity scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec16"&gt;Survival analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate survival distributions for the matched groups. Log-rank tests were conducted to assess the differences between treatment groups. GraphPad Prism was used to visualize Kaplan–Meier curves, 95% CIs and at-risk numbers at 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 months, including after extraction of propensity score-matched data from R. Comparisons between groups in primary datasets (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09655-y#Fig1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;) were reported as adjusted HRs calculated with Cox proportional hazard regression. Comparisons between groups in subgroup analyses were reported as unadjusted HRs calculated with log-rank tests to preserve robustness. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values are reported for primary survival analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In settings in which Kaplan–Meier curves crossed, the restricted mean survival time was calculated using area under the curve analysis of the absolute differences between arms at 12 and 24 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All statistical analyses were conducted in R v.4.4.2 (2024-10-31) and GraphPad Prism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec17"&gt;Quantification of PD-L1 expression in biopsy samples&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For patients in both the tissue-agnostic cohort and the NSCLC dataset, biopsy date, pathology reports, histological information and diagnosis codes were collected for patients who had received a biopsy with pathology evaluating PD-L1 at MD Anderson (from January 2020 to October 2023 for the tissue-agnostic cohort and August 2016 to August 2022 for the NSCLC cohort). PD-L1 on tumour cells (TPS) and PD-L1 on tumour cells and immune cells together (CPS) were obtained from pathology reports. Data were curated according to the following principles: (1) simple quantitative values were replicated exactly; (2) TPS values of “&amp;lt;1%” were reported as 0%; (3) for patients with a CPS of 0% or CPS &amp;lt;1% with no TPS value, TPS was reported as 0%, as CPS of 0 or &amp;lt;1% implies a lack of expression of PD-L1 on both tumour cells and myeloid cells; (4) TPS values between 1.1 and 49.9 reported as “&amp;lt;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;%” or “&amp;gt;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;%” were excluded due to lack of interpretability; (5) TPS values of &amp;gt;50% were recorded as 50% and TPS values &amp;gt;60% were recorded as 60%, and so on, as these values indicate high PD-L1 expression. For ranges of PD-L1 expression (for example, 0–5%), the median of the numbers in the range was taken as an approximate estimation of PD-L1 on tumours. Replicate patient biopsies (repeat biopsies performed on the same patient within 2 months of a previous biopsy) were excluded, and the earliest biopsy was included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, survival was analysed in the tumour-agnostic dataset with any COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of ICI compared with patients who had no recorded history of a COVID-19 vaccine. Survival analysis was performed as listed in the NSCLC dataset for all patients in this dataset who were treated with ICI in this cohort. TPS values were not required for inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For group-wise analysis, patients in these cohorts were grouped into (1) those who received their closest COVID-19 mRNA vaccination less than 100 days before tissue biopsy; (2) patients who received their closest COVID-19 mRNA vaccine more than or exactly 100 days before tissue biopsy; and (3) patients who did not receive a COVID-19 mRNA vaccination before biopsy. Patients who received non-mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines within 100 days before biopsy were included in the no-vaccine group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec18"&gt;Healthy human participants&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies in healthy volunteers were approved by the MD Anderson Institutional Review Board. Informed consent was obtained from each healthy participant before plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected and stored at baseline, 6 h, 24 h and 48 h, or baseline, 6 h, 24 h, 7 days and 14 days after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, depending on the formulation used. BNT162b2 (COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, 2024–2025 formula, with 30 μg mRNA) and mRNA-1273 (Spikevax Monovalent XBB.1.5, COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, 2023–2024 formulation, with 50 μg mRNA) were used for the first and second timeframes, respectively. Frozen plasma was thawed and analysed using the NULISAseq Inflammation Panel 250 by Alamar Biosciences. Absolute quantification of IFNα concentrations was performed using the NULISAseq Inflammation Panel AQ. Statistical analysis was performed using R, in which we evaluated significance using a linear model with fixed effects based on the time from vaccine and controlling for patient ID (paired), including accommodation of biological variance between the baselines using the limma package’s duplicateCorrelation function. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were calculated using moderated &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-tests with FDR correction for multiple testing. For comparisons between Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, we used a linear modelling approach (limma) to assess the log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-transformed fold change in cytokine concentrations per-patient from the baseline to 6 h and 24 h. Moderated &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-tests with empirical Bayes shrinkage were applied, and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were corrected using the Benjamini–Hochberg FDR method. Contrasts were constructed to directly compare Moderna versus Pfizer for each timepoint. Cytokines were visualized if they demonstrated significant differences between Moderna and Pfizer from the baseline to 6 h or 24 h (absolute value of log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-transformed fold change greater than 0.5 and FDR-corrected &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Mean expression values per condition were normalized to the baseline and visualized. Volcano plots were generated using R. Heat maps and graphs of cytokines with significant changes in relative expression in the plasma at 24 h were generated in GraphPad Prism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec19"&gt;Human flow cytometry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were thawed in a 37 °C water bath and immediately transferred into a 50 ml tube containing 9 ml of complete RPMI medium (RPMI + 10% FBS) at a ratio of 1 part cells to 9 parts medium. Cells were centrifuged at 400&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min, and the supernatant was decanted. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, and incubated with live/dead marker (1 µl per 1,000 µl of cell suspension, containing 1–10 million cells per ml) for 30 min at 4 °C. After incubation, 3 ml of PBS + 2% FBS was added, and the cells were centrifuged again at 400&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 8 min and the supernatant was decanted. Cells were then pre-incubated with 5 µl of Human TruStain FcX (BioLegend, 422302) per 100 µl of cell suspension for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed with PBS and centrifuged at 400&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 6 min. After decanting the supernatant, 10 µl of Brilliant buffer was added to each tube, and the mixture was allowed to sit for 5 min before addition of antibodies targeting extracellular markers and the cells were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. After incubation, cells were washed and fixed in the dark for 45 min at 4 °C with 500 µl of fixation solution (BD). Cells were then permeabilized with 2 ml permeabilization buffer. Intracellular stains were added in permeabilization buffer, and cells were incubated for approximately 40 min at room temperature. After incubation, cells were washed with permeabilization buffer and resuspended in 200 µl of PBS + 2% FBS. Analysis was then conducted using Cytek Aurora Spectral Flow Cytometer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec20"&gt;Preclinical experiments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All mouse experiments and procedures were approved by the University of Florida or the University of Texas MD Anderson Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Mice (aged 4–10 weeks) were maintained at 21 ± 1 °C and 35% humidity under a 14 h–10 h light–dark cycle. Mice were randomized prior to treatment. Tumour measurements were performed blinded to the treatment group. Euthanasia was performed by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inhalation followed by cervical dislocation in accordance with approved protocols. Humane end points included tumour ulceration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C57BL/6 and &lt;i&gt;Rigi&lt;/i&gt;-knockout mice (&lt;i&gt;C57BL/6NJ-Rigiem1(IMPC)J/Mmjax&lt;/i&gt;) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (046070-JAX) and bred in house. Tumour-bearing mice were implanted s.c. with 50,000 B16F0 melanoma cells, 1 million B16F10-OVA melanoma cells or 200,000 LLC cells in the right flank. Orthotopic LLC models were implemented by implanting 100,000 LLC cells into the left lung of C57BL6 mice through direct injection below the 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; rib. A mix of male and female mice was used for experiments with B16F0, and male mice were used for experiments with LLC. All mice were vaccinated intramuscularly with 25 μg per dose of RNA-LNP or RNA-LPA (mRNA fraction)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 12" title="Mendez-Gomez, H.

The 5′ SpeI restriction site was removed from the sequence to allow for restriction of the poly(A) tail.

Plasmids were grown in NEB5a competent &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and purified using the RNeasy Maxi kit (Qiagen, 75162) and sequenced using whole-plasmid sequencing by Genewiz. Plasmids were restricted by using 2 U μg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; SpeI HF (NEB, R3133L) for 2 h at 37 °C followed by DNA precipitation. mRNA was synthesized using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 mRNA Kit with CleanCap Reagent AG (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A57620).

The encapsulation efficiency was determined by comparing readings to LNPs in TE buffer versus LNPs in 1% Triton X-100. LNPs were diluted up to 500 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; with PBS before injection. Empty LNPs were used at a volume consistent with the dose of RNA-LNPs fabricated using the same steps and same amounts of lipids. Fluorescence values were plotted in a standard curve with an extrapolation factor set to 1.1. The values from wells with Triton X-100 (total mRNA) and TE buffer (free mRNA) was entered into the following equation: EE% = [1 – (Free RNA/Total RNA)] × 100%. Total mRNA RNA-LNPs were also loaded onto a 1% agarose gel made in 1× TAE buffer (Quality Biological, 351-008-131) with GelRed (Biotium, 41003-T). Then 500 ng of RNA was loaded into LNPs and free RNA was mixed with 6× SDS-free (NEB, B7025S) loading dye and run at 90 V for 45 min. Particle size was acquired using a Malvern Zetasizer Ultra and NanoSight’s NS300. Before particle-size, PDI, concentration and surface ζ potential analysis, LNPs were diluted 100-fold with HyClone HyPure water (Cytiva, SH30538.02). They were and run in triplicate at 25 °C on the Zetasizer. Orthogonal particle-size distribution and concentration measurements were carried out using Malvern’s NanoSight NS300 NTA equipment. Each LNP sample was diluted 500-fold with PBS and pumped through the equipment at constant speed for five captures with optimized camera settings. An optimized detection threshold was set for analysis. mRNA was extracted from LNPs by dissolving 750 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; with 5 volumes of ethanol or 2 volumes of isopropanol followed by 2 washes with cold 70% ethanol. RNA pellets were dissolved in RNase-free H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O before analysis using the TapeStation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec23"&gt;Plasma collection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were bled through the retroorbital route using heparinized capillaries (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 22-362566) collecting a maximum of 200 µl into EDTA coated tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NC9414041). Whole blood was centrifuged at 1,200&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 15 min. Plasma was collected and stored at −80 °C until use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec24"&gt;Processing tumours for flow cytometry analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tumours were dissected from euthanized mice with the external fibrous sac left intact. Tumours were bisected using a scalpel and half of each sample was placed into a GentleMacs column GentleMACS C Tube (130-096-334) with an enzyme mix containing 10 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, C5138-1G), 1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of hyaluronidase (StemCell Technologies, 07461) and 200 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of DNase (Sigma-Aldrich, D5025-150KU) or using the tumour dissociation kit (Miltenyi, 130-096-730) followed by debris removal (Miltenyi, 130-109-398). Samples were run on a m_TDK_1 cycle and centrifuged at 300&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 5 min after completion. The pellets were resuspended in cold PBS and filtered through a 70-µm cell strainer. The samples were washed twice using cold PBS and then manually counted using a haemocytometer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec25"&gt;Isolation of splenocytes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole spleens were collected from euthanized mice and placed into cold RPMI medium. The spleens were then teased through a 70-µm filter and lysed for 5 min at 37 °C using 1× BD Pharmalyse buffer (BD, 555899). Lysis buffer was quenched with medium and centrifuged at 500&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 5 min. Splenocytes were resuspended in cold PBS and filtered through a 70-µm cell strainer and washed once with PBS before being counted using the Beckman Coulter Vi-cell XR or haemocytometer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec26"&gt;Mouse flow cytometry analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells from either tumours and spleens were placed into 96-well V-bottom plates. Unless stated otherwise, the washing steps were performed by centrifugation at 500&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 5 min at 4 °C followed by resuspension of cells with 200 µl of buffer, with mixing done by pipetting. Cells were washed with cold PBS and stained with 100 µl of live/dead stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, L10119) for 30 min at 4 °C. Live/dead dye was quenched with 100 µl of cold PBS and the cells were washed once with cold FACS buffer (PBS with 2% FBS). Cells were centrifuged and resuspended with 10 µl True stain FCX buffer (BioLegend, 422302) diluted to 100 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; with FACS buffer for 10 min. Then 90 µl of antibodies (Supplementary Tables &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09655-y#MOESM1"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09655-y#MOESM1"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;) and Brilliant Stain buffer (BD, 563794) were added and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Next, 100 µl of FACS buffer was added to each well and the cells were washed twice with cold FACS buffer. Cells were fixed for 15 min with 100 µl of Cytofix buffer (BD, 554655) at 4 °C. Next, 100 µl of PBS was added to each sample and cells were washed twice and stored in FACS buffer at 4 °C in the dark until analysis. Initial compensation was acquired using Ultracomp eBeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 01-2222-42) and ArC amine reactive compensation beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A10346). Results were acquired using a BD Symphony A3 and analysed using FlowJo v.10.8.1 and v.10.10.0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec27"&gt;Tetramer production&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peptides selected to be high-affinity binders for Survivin (ATFKNWPFL), GP100A (EGSRNQDWL), GP100B (KVPRNQDWL), WT1 (RMFPNAPYL), CLDN6 or claudin 6 (KVYDSLLAL) and TRP2 (SVYDFFVWL) were purchased from GenScript. H2-Db and H2-Kb monomers were purchased as easYmers from ImmunAware (5001-01 and 5004-01, respectively), and tetramers were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, peptides were reconstituted to 1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in deionized water, further diluted to 75 μM and incubated with easYmer (Eagle Biosciences, 5004-01, 5001-01) at 18 °C for 48 h. The resulting complexes were tetramerized by gradually mixing with streptavidin-APC (BD Biosciences, 554067). After incubation, a final stock concentration of 500 nM for each tetramer was achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec28"&gt;Tetramer staining&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the manufacturer recommendations, 1–2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells were stained with tetramer diluted to 20 nM in FACS buffer. Cells were left to stain in the dark at room temperature for 1 h, washed once with FACS buffer, co-stained with surface antibodies (CD3, CD4) at room temperature for 20 min, washed twice with FACS buffer and analysed on a Cytek Aurora flow cytometer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec29"&gt;AIM assay&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AIM assay was performed as previously described&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 12" title="Mendez-Gomez, H.

In this iteration, whole splenocytes were used rather than isolated T cells. In brief, 24 h after the last RNA-LNP vaccine, splenocytes were collected for antigen recall assay. Spleens were collected and processed as described above. 1 million splenocytes were cultured in a 96-well round-bottom plate in T cell medium containing RPMI 1640 (Gibco, 11-875-119), 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 35-011-CV), 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco, 30-002-CI), 1% MEM non-essential amino acids (NEAA, Gibco, 11140050), 1% sodium pyruvate (Gibco, 11360070), 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol (BME, Gibco, 21985-023) and 0.2 µg tumour-associated peptides without cytokines. Peptides were chosen based on their suggested upregulation in melanoma tumours&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 12" title="Mendez-Gomez, H.

Selected peptides were purchased from JPT Peptide Technologies and reconstituted according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Co-culture was maintained for 48 h in an incubator at 37 °C under 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Cells were next collected and stained for the AIM assay for evaluating activation of antigen-specific T cells. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in FACS buffer containing antibodies mix (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09655-y#MOESM1"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;). Cells were washed three times and fixed using fixation medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, GAS001S100) for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed once with PBS and were stored in FACS buffer at 4 °C in the dark until analysis. Results were acquired using a BD Fortessa III. Values were normalized by subtracting the percentage of AIM&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells of tbe DMSO-only controls from each treatment condition. Statistical analysis was performed using Brown–Forsythe and Welch ANOVA, followed by Dunnett’s T3 multiple-comparison test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec30"&gt;ELISA and multiplex analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plasma was analysed for cytokine concentration using ELISAs and multiplex cytokine arrays. A portion of the plasma samples were assessed for IFNα through ELISA (Invitrogen, BMS6027). Plasma was also sent for analysis by Eve Technologies for multiplex cytokine array (MD44). For quantification of spike IgG, mice that received three vaccines/vehicle doses during tumour studies were bled once the humane end point was reached. Spike-specific IgG was determined using an Anti-mouse SARS-CoV-2 IgG titre assay (AcroBiosystems, RAS-T023). Plasma was diluted 100,000-fold and run according to the company’s recommended parameters for semiquantitative analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec31"&gt;Immunofluorescence&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half of bisected tumours were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight. The samples were washed three times using PBS and then immersed successively into 10%, 20% and 30% sucrose for cryopreservation. Tissue was then embedded in O.C.T. (Tissue-Tek, 4583) and stored at −80 °C. Blocks of tissue were moved to −20 °C for 24 h and were sectioned at a thickness of 30 µm using the Leica cryostat, and the sections were placed onto microscope slides. Before staining, the slides were brought up to room temperature for 15 min and washed three times with PBS. Tissue was blocked at room temperature for 1 h using a blocking buffer containing 2% goat or donkey serum, 1% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The sections were then stained with primary antibodies (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09655-y#MOESM1"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;) in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, the sections were washed three times with PBS and stained with secondary antibodies (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09655-y#MOESM1"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;) diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After three 5 min PBS washes, the sections were incubated with DAPI (1:1,000 in PBS) for 10 min at room temperature. After a triple PBS wash, the sections were mounted with Prolong Glass Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher Scientific, P36984) and covered with a cover glass. Images were acquired using a Leica Stellaris 8 WLL Spectral Confocal Microscope. Image processing was performed using Fiji ImageJ software (NIH) and Imaris (Oxford Instruments).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec32"&gt;Reporting summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further information on research design is available in the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09655-y#MOESM2"&gt;Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary&lt;/a&gt; linked to this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 15:36:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE5xdzZ3ZXkxU2FUTjEtQlk3WGdkajJZNDdlZm5GWTJwWXIzbGdPZHZOSUFkcTFWd29yWjdkQUR1MzRNTGR2dXk3VEVyaTg4czJLQy1qTFlyaWd2Mi1CcWNF</guid></item><item><title>探索最先进的强化学习算法- Nature</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09761-x</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__content" id="Abs1-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans and other animals use powerful reinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms that have been discovered by evolution over many generations of trial and error. By contrast, artificial agents typically learn using hand-crafted learning rules. Despite decades of interest, the goal of autonomously discovering powerful RL algorithms has proven elusive&lt;sup&gt;7-12&lt;/sup&gt;. In this work, we show that it is possible for machines to discover a state-of-the-art RL rule that outperforms manually-designed rules. This was achieved by meta-learning from the cumulative experiences of a population of agents across a large number of complex environments. Specifically, our method discovers the RL rule by which the agent's policy and predictions are updated. In our large-scale experiments, the discovered rule surpassed all existing rules on the well-established Atari benchmark and outperformed a number of state-of-the-art RL algorithms on challenging benchmarks that it had not seen during discovery. Our findings suggest that the RL algorithms required for advanced artificial intelligence may soon be automatically discovered from the experiences of agents, rather than manually designed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 15:13:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTFBxOTZzT2VhRl9kMjhMLWVTME4yQW5YZmVrblV5Z05xWEJ6OWxzY0RYWVV2U0JUc0EwUFVuTkRKRElVd3lWd1gwTkItQ0l4TW9NVkpXUDFZMThMcHNRZGlJ</guid></item><item><title>COVID-19 mRNA疫苗可以解锁癌症治疗的下一场革命–新研究- The Conversation</title><link>https://theconversation.com/covid-19-mrna-vaccines-could-unlock-the-next-revolution-in-cancer-treatment-new-research-258992</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccines that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamahealthforum.2025.2223"&gt;saved 2.5 million lives globally&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic could help spark the immune system to fight cancer. This is the surprising takeaway of a new study that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09655-y"&gt;we and our colleagues published in the journal Nature&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While developing mRNA vaccines for patients with brain tumors in 2016, our team, led by &lt;a href="https://directory.ufhealth.org/sayour-elias"&gt;pediatric oncologist Elias Sayour&lt;/a&gt;, discovered that mRNA can train immune systems to kill tumors – &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41551-025-01380-1"&gt;even if the mRNA is not related to cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on this finding, we hypothesized that mRNA vaccines designed to target the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 might also have antitumor effects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AqVdPM4AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;we looked at clinical outcomes&lt;/a&gt; for more than 1,000 late-stage melanoma and lung cancer patients treated with a type of immunotherapy called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.03.006"&gt;immune checkpoint inhibitors&lt;/a&gt;. This treatment is a common approach doctors use to train the immune system to kill cancer. It does this by blocking a protein that tumor cells make to turn off immune cells, enabling the immune system to continue killing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, patients who received either the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy were more than twice as likely to be alive after three years compared with those who didn’t receive either vaccine. Surprisingly, patients with tumors that don’t typically respond well to immunotherapy also saw very strong benefits, with nearly fivefold improvement in three-year overall survival. This link between improved survival and receiving a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine remained strong even after we controlled for factors like disease severity and co-occurring conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the underlying mechanism, &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E2q2tK8AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;we turned to animal models&lt;/a&gt;. We found that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines act like an alarm, triggering the body’s immune system to recognize and kill tumor cells and overcome the cancer’s ability to turn off immune cells. When combined, vaccines and immune checkpoint inhibitors coordinate to unleash the full power of the immune system to kill cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;University of Florida Health pediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, who led the research, explains that mRNA vaccines that are not specific to a patient’s cancer can ‘wake up the sleeping giant that is the immune system to fight cancer.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why it matters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors has &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.03.006"&gt;revolutionized cancer treatment&lt;/a&gt; over the past decade by producing cures in many patients who were previously considered incurable. However, these therapies are ineffective in patients with &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/cold-tumor"&gt;“cold” tumors&lt;/a&gt; that successfully evade immune detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that mRNA vaccines may provide just the spark the immune system needs to turn these “cold” tumors “hot.” If validated in our upcoming clinical trial, our hope is that this widely available, low-cost intervention could extend the benefits of immunotherapy to millions of patients who otherwise would not benefit from this therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Combining immunotherapy with mRNA vaccines could allow more patients to benefit from this treatment.&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What other research is being done&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike vaccines for infectious diseases, which are used to prevent an infection, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/modernas-experimental-cancer-vaccine-treats-but-doesnt-prevent-melanoma-a-biochemist-explains-how-it-works-197003"&gt;therapeutic cancer vaccines&lt;/a&gt; are used to help train the immune systems of cancer patients to better fight tumors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We and many others are &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/modernas-experimental-cancer-vaccine-treats-but-doesnt-prevent-melanoma-a-biochemist-explains-how-it-works-197003"&gt;currently working hard&lt;/a&gt; to make &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/customizing-mrna-is-easy-and-thats-what-makes-it-the-next-frontier-for-personalized-medicine-a-molecular-biologist-explains-216127"&gt;personalized mRNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/brain-cancer-in-children-is-notoriously-hard-to-treat-a-new-mrna-cancer-vaccine-triggers-an-attack-from-within-228666"&gt;patients with cancer&lt;/a&gt;. This involves taking a small sample of a patient’s tumor and using machine learning algorithms to predict which proteins in the tumor would be the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-022-01270-x"&gt;best targets for a vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. However, this approach can be &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-023-01674-3"&gt;costly and difficult to manufacture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, COVID-19 mRNA vaccines do not need to be personalized, are already widely available at low or no cost around the globe, and could be administered at any time during a patient’s treatment. Our findings that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09655-y"&gt;COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have substantial antitumor effects&lt;/a&gt; bring hope that they could help extend the anti-cancer benefits of mRNA vaccines to all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What’s next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In pursuit of this goal, we are preparing to test this treatment strategy in patients with a nationwide clinical trial in people with lung cancer. People receiving an immune checkpoint inhibitor will be randomized to either receive a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine during treatment or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study will tell us whether COVID-19 mRNA vaccines should be included as part of the standard of care for patients receiving an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Ultimately, we hope that this approach will help many patients who are treated with immune therapy, and especially those who currently lack effective treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work exemplifies how a tool born from a global pandemic may provide a new weapon against cancer and rapidly extend the benefits of existing treatments to millions of patients. By harnessing a familiar vaccine in a new way, we hope to extend the lifesaving benefits of immunotherapy to cancer patients who were previously left behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/us/topics/research-brief-83231"&gt;Research Brief&lt;/a&gt; is a short take on interesting academic work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — The most widely used &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-covid-shots-fda-kennedy-pfizer-children-9ce19908ae7afb354732aa162fd28532" rel="nofollow"&gt;COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; may offer a surprise benefit for some cancer patients – revving up their immune systems to help fight tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with advanced lung or skin cancer who were taking certain &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/4c83cc7cc92a430b8c026691e77815c2" rel="nofollow"&gt;immunotherapy drugs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; lived substantially longer if they also got a Pfizer or Moderna shot within 100 days of starting treatment, according to preliminary research being reported Wednesday in the journal Nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it had nothing to do with virus infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/mrna-kennedy-rfk-jr-covid-flu-51babaaeb003c45473080a52d67d7d72" rel="nofollow"&gt;the molecule that powers those specific vaccines, mRNA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, appears to help the immune system respond better to the cutting-edge cancer treatment, concluded researchers from MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and the University of Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine “acts like a siren to activate immune cells throughout the body,” said lead researcher Dr. Adam Grippin of MD Anderson. “We’re sensitizing immune-resistant tumors to immune therapy.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has raised skepticism about mRNA vaccines, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/kennedy-vaccines-mrna-pfizer-moderna-1fb5b9436f2957075064c18a6cbbe3c9" rel="nofollow"&gt;cutting $500 million in funding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for some uses of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this research team found its results so promising that it is preparing a more rigorous study to see if mRNA coronavirus vaccines should be paired with cancer drugs called checkpoint inhibitors — an interim step while it designs new mRNA vaccines for use in cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A healthy immune system often kills cancer cells before they become a threat. But some tumors evolve to hide from immune attack. &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPsgoqfas&amp;amp;list=PLslqZ7OaczKEUNNDVq-u_OE31P2k7UwKc&amp;amp;index=19" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Checkpoint inhibitors remove that cloak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. It’s a powerful treatment – when it works. Some people’s immune cells still don’t recognize the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Messenger RNA, or mRNA, is naturally found in every cell and it contains genetic instructions for our bodies to make proteins. While best known as the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/nobel-prize-medicine-71306bd18785477f3a85a69caa6e09c9" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nobel Prize-winning technology behind COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, scientists have long been trying to create personalized mRNA “treatment vaccines” that train immune cells to spot unique features of a patient’s tumor.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The new research offers “a very good clue” that maybe an off-the-shelf approach could work, said Dr. Jeff Coller, an mRNA specialist at Johns Hopkins University who wasn’t involved with the work. “What it shows is that mRNA medicines are continuing to surprise us in how beneficial they can be to human health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grippin and his Florida colleagues had been developing personalized mRNA cancer vaccines when they realized that even one created without a specific target appeared to spur similar immune activity against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grippin wondered if the already widely available mRNA coronavirus shots might also have some effect, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the team analyzed records of nearly 1,000 advanced cancer patients undergoing checkpoint inhibitor treatment at MD Anderson – comparing those who happened to get a Pfizer or Moderna shot with those who didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccinated lung cancer patients were nearly twice as likely to be alive three years after beginning cancer treatment as the unvaccinated patients. Among melanoma patients, median survival was significantly longer for vaccinated patients – but exactly how much isn’t clear, as some of that group were still alive when the data was analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Non-mRNA vaccines such as flu shots didn’t make a difference, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team's work represents the first comprehensive, evidence-supported dietary recommendations specifically for adults living with long-term constipation. The research also found that supplements such as psyllium fiber, certain probiotics, and magnesium oxide may provide additional relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, some popular methods often promoted for constipation management, including general "high-fiber diets" and senna supplements (a type of laxative), were found to lack convincing scientific support for effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backed by Strong Evidence and Expert Endorsement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines were published in two major international journals, the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Human Nutrition &amp;amp; Dietetics&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Neurogastroenterology &amp;amp; Motility&lt;/em&gt;, and are endorsed by the British Dietetic Association (BDA). The aim is to transform how constipation is treated in clinical settings by providing healthcare professionals with clear, evidence-based tools. The guidelines also give individuals the ability to manage their condition more effectively through diet and hydration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constipation is a chronic condition that can seriously affect quality of life while adding to healthcare costs. Previous clinical recommendations have typically relied on increasing dietary fiber and fluid intake, an approach that researchers now say may be overly simplistic and outdated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Science Behind the New Guidelines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike earlier guidance, the new recommendations draw on extensive systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Using the GRADE framework to evaluate evidence quality, an expert panel consisting of dietitians, a nutritionist, gastroenterologist, gut physiologist, and general practitioner examined data from more than 75 clinical trials. Their work resulted in 59 recommendations and the identification of 12 key areas for future research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eirini Dimidi, Reader in Nutritional Sciences at King's College London and lead author, explained:&lt;strong&gt; "&lt;/strong&gt;Chronic constipation can have a huge impact on someone's day-to-day life. For the first time, we've provided direction on what dietary approaches could genuinely help, and which diet advice lacks evidence. Being able to improve this condition through dietary changes would allow people to self-manage their symptoms more and, hopefully, improve their quality of life."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalized Nutrition and Global Application&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidelines also emphasize measurable outcomes, such as stool frequency and consistency, straining, and quality of life. This practical focus allows healthcare professionals to tailor dietary advice to individual symptom patterns. To support implementation, the researchers have created a clinician-friendly tool that can be used worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review also revealed that while several foods and supplements appear effective, the quality of most existing research remains low. Many trials examined single interventions instead of comprehensive diet patterns, highlighting the need for more robust nutrition studies in constipation management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rethinking Fiber and Future Directions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dimidi noted that although high-fiber diets are often promoted as beneficial for overall health, the new findings indicate limited evidence for their specific effectiveness in relieving constipation. "Eating a high fiber diet offers many benefits to overall health and has been a go-to recommendation for constipation," she said. "However, our guidelines found that there simply isn't enough evidence to suggest it actually works in constipation specifically. Instead, our research reveals some new dietary strategies that could indeed help patients. At the same time, we urgently need more high-quality trials to strengthen the evidence on what works and what doesn't."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Kevin Whelan, senior author and Professor of Dietetics at King's College London, added: "This new guidance marks a promising step towards empowering health professionals and their patients to manage constipation through diet. This means that from now on that people suffering from constipation across the world can now receive up-to-date advice based upon the best available evidence in order to improve their symptoms and well-being. With continued research, it holds real potential to drive lasting improvements in quality of life."&lt;/p&gt;

Four hours after the final tamoxifen injection, mice were infected with &lt;i&gt;C. rodentium&lt;/i&gt;. Mice were grouped by genotype or by treatment with no randomization. The C57BL/6J female mice in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09645-0#Fig9"&gt;5i&lt;/a&gt; were from the Jackson Laboratory and were eight weeks old at the time of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;C. rodentium&lt;/i&gt; were streaked out from glycerol stocks on MacConkey agar plates at 37 °C overnight. A single colony was inoculated into 10 ml Luria broth (LB) and grown on a shaker at 37 °C overnight. The overnight culture was diluted 1:100 and grown to log phase (optical density at 600 nm (OD&lt;sub&gt;600 nm&lt;/sub&gt;) of around 0.5 after approximately three hours). Bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 6,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 15 min, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and prepared for infection by equalization to 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; CFUs per ml (1 OD&lt;sub&gt;600 nm&lt;/sub&gt; = 8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; bacteria per ml). Mice were fasted for four hours and then dosed by oral gavage with 5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09645-0#Fig4"&gt;4i–k&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09645-0#Fig9"&gt;5j&lt;/a&gt;) or 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09645-0#Fig9"&gt;5h,i&lt;/a&gt;) CFUs of &lt;i&gt;C. rodentium&lt;/i&gt; (strains described below). Mice had access to food and water ad libitum after infection. At six or ten days after infection, mice were euthanized and gastrointestinal samples, including colon and caecum, were collected. Tissues were resected and splayed open, and the luminal contents were removed and resuspended in pre-weighted tubes containing 1 ml PBS. Tissues were later washed with PBS to remove non-adherent bacteria. Colon, caecum or spleen homogenate was plated on MacConkey agar containing 100 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; streptomycin (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09645-0#Fig8"&gt;4e&lt;/a&gt;) or LB agar containing nalidixic acid (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09645-0#Fig4"&gt;4e&lt;/a&gt;) to determine CFUs.

Mice underwent food restriction for 12 h before receiving a 600 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; oral gavage of 4 kDa FITC–dextran. Four hours later, blood and faecal pellets were collected, and FITC fluorescence (485/528 nm ex/em) was measured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec11"&gt;Bacteria&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;EHEC O157:H7 EDL933 (ATCC700927) and &lt;i&gt;C. rodentium&lt;/i&gt; DBS100 (ATCC51459) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). A nalidixic-acid-resistant strain was derived from DBS100 by first growing 1 ml DBS100 overnight. The culture was centrifuged, resuspended in 100 µl PBS and plated on LB agar containing 30 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; nalidixic acid.

Imaging parameters on the Leica LAS X (v.3.7.5) software were set to acquire DAPI, PI, SYTOX green and GFP (bacteria). Three-dimensional (3D) confocal &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-stacks were acquired using Nyquist sampling rates. Six to seven fields of view were acquired for each sample. The 3D datasets were processed and analysed using the Imaris Spots tool to quantify cellular extrusion levels. In brief, a Gaussian blur image filter was first applied to all channels to reduce background noise. Afterwards, the Imaris Spots tool was used to segment and isolate DAPI- and PI-positive or SYTOX-green-positive cells (PI&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;DAPI+ or SYTOX&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;DAPI&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) from the 3D image stacks. A low threshold intensity was set for the PI and SYTOX channel so that both infected and uninfected cells were segmented using the Imaris Spots tool. After segmentation, the shortest distance metric in Imaris was used to calculate the distance between the centroids of a PI&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or SYTOX&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; spot and the closest DAPI&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; spot. A batch Imaris run to segment spots of DAPI&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and PI&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or SYTOX&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells was performed using identical segmentation parameters. The shortest distance metric was then extracted and used for quantification of the cell-extrusion analysis of all samples. Bacteria exhibiting GFP signals were filtered out by segmenting and masking them using a pixel classifier in Imaris. After this masking procedure, the shortest distance between SYTOX-green-positive cells and DAPI-positive cells was measured to analyse extrusion events, as detailed above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For live imaging of transparent monolayers, plates were imaged for two hours in a live imaging set-up (Celldiscoverer 7), recording oblique/bright-field and red fluorescence with a Hammamastu Orca Flash 4.0 camera. Images were taken using the 5×/0.35 NA objective with the addition of the 2× optovar. Images were collected on the Celldiscoverer 7 in intervals of 60 s with the exposure and light source intensity of oblique and red channels set at 5 ms and 15%, and 50 ms and 30%, respectively. Focus was maintained throughout the time-lapse using the Zeiss definite focus system. Extrusion was quantified in a blinded manner, by recording the time from the first noticeable changes in cell shape to the finished extrusion of PI-positive cells in the bright-field/oblique channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec14"&gt;IL-18 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hundred microlitres of medium from transwell infection experiments, collected immediately before infected monolayers were fixed for microscopy, was analysed with mouse IL-18 DuoSet ELISA (R&amp;amp;D Systems DY7625-05) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and quantified using a standard curve.

The background resistance of an empty transwell with medium was subtracted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec17"&gt;Plasmids and lentiviral vectors&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetically barcoded &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; effector library was maintained in the lentiviral vector pMIN-ducer (Genscript). cDNAs encoding N-terminal 3×Flag-NleL, NleL(C753A), the PPR domain (amino acids (aa) 135–371), or the NEL domain (aa 372–782) were expressed using pMIN-ducer or pCDNA3.1Hygro(+) (Genscript). cDNAs encoding Myc–GST-tagged CARDs (Extended Data Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09645-0#Tab2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) were cloned into pCDNA3.1:Zeo(+) (Genscript). cDNAs encoding C-terminal Rho-1D4-tagged caspase-1, caspase-4 or caspase-1/4 CARD swap chimeras (aa 1–80, 1–10, 6–15, 11–20, 16–25 and 21–30) were cloned into pCDNA3.1Hygro(+) (Genscript). cDNAs encoding C-terminal Rho-1D4-tagged ROCK1, ROCK2, ROCK2ΔPH (aa 1–1,141), ROCK2-PH (aa 1,142–1,354) and C-terminal truncations (20 aa from Δ20–240) were cloned into pCDNA3.1Hygro(+) (Genscript). For transient expression in 293T cells, 3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells were plated in 10-cm dishes and transfected the next day with 3 µg of pCDNA3.1Zeo(+) total plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Proteins were expressed for 24 h before being collected for downstream manipulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For lentiviral packaging, 2.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; 293T cells in 10-cm plates were transfected with 5 µg pMIN-ducer, 10 µg pCMV-Δ8.9 and 0.5 µg pCMV-VSVG (1:2.3:0.2 mole ratio). Virus-containing supernatants were collected after 72 h, passed through 0.45-μm syringe filters and used immediately for infection of EA.hy926, Caco-2 or HT-29 cells (2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; cells seeded into six-well plates the previous day). Virus was supplemented with 10 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; polybrene (Millipore) during infections. After 48 h, transduced cells were selected with 4 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; puromycin (Takara). Mock-infected cells were used to judge selection duration and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec18"&gt;Positive selection screen&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lentiviral library was packaged using 12 15-cm plates of 293T cells. Each plate (2.7 × 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; cells) was transfected with 50.8 µg DNA (library plasmid, pCMV-Δ8.9 and pCMV-VSVG plasmids at a molar ratio of 1:2:0.2) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). At six hours after transfection, the medium containing the transfection mix was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with 1 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; DNase I, 5 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 20 mM HEPES pH 7.2. After overnight culture at 37 °C, this medium was replaced with fresh medium. After another 24 h, the lentivirus-containing medium was collected, pooled, passed through a 0.45 µm filter and concentrated by ultracentrifugation (Thermo Fisher Scientific, S50-A fixed angle rotor, 100,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;). Concentrated lentivirus was resuspended in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and aliquots were stored at −80 °C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EA.hy926 cells were infected at an MOI of 0.3 to ensure a single integrant frequency of 97% with 1,000-fold coverage. On day 1, EA.hy926 cells were seeded into two 10-cm plates (1.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells each). On day 2, cells were infected with lentivirus diluted in DMEM supplemented with 10 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; polybrene (Millipore). On day 3, virus-containing medium was replaced with fresh DMEM. On day 4, cells were expanded into a 15-cm plate. On day 5, antibiotic selection was initiated with DMEM containing 2 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; puromycin (Takara). After a further five days, cells were expanded into four 15-cm plates with antibiotic-free DMEM, and cultured for two days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For LPS screens, EA.hy926 containing the &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; effector library were seeded into six 15-cm plates (1.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells per plate). &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; effectors were induced with 250 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; doxycycline for 48 h. For each plate, cells were lifted with TrypLE Express (Thermo Fisher Scientific), washed with PBS, resuspended in 110 µl Buffer R (Neon, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and electroporated (three plates with and three plates without 7 µg LPS) using the Neon Transfection System 100 µl kit. Electroporated cells were washed with PBS and plated in six-well dishes containing fresh DMEM. Electroporated control cells were passaged until LPS-electroporated cells recovered. After 11 days, genomic DNA was isolated from LPS-resistant and control cells using the Gentra Puregene Cell kit (QIAGEN). The barcoded regions were amplified by PCR and then sequenced by next-generation sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec19"&gt;Next-generation sequencing and analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For submitted PCR amplicons, 40 ng DNA was used to generate sequencing libraries with the KAPA HyperPrep kit (Roche) that incorporated custom adapters and library amplification PCR primers from Integrated DNA Technologies. Amplicon libraries were quantified and the average library size was determined using the NGS Fragment kit in Fragment Analyzer (Agilent Technologies). Libraries were pooled and the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to quantify the pool. Library pools were sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina) to generate a minimum of three million paired-end 75-base-pair reads for each sample. A sample ORF matrix was generated by counting exact matches of ORF barcodes in the sample FASTQ files. The count matrix was normalized by library-size-based factors.

The following day, cells were treated with 250 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; doxycycline (Takara). After a further 24 h, cells were transfected with ultra-pure &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; O111:B4 LPS (0.5 µg per well, InvivoGen) using Lipofectamine LTX transfection reagent (0.2 µl per well, Thermo Fisher Scientific), or treated with 25 µM Val-boroPro (Millipore) for 24 h. LDH release was measured by CytoTox Non-radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega).

Cells were treated with doxycycline for zero, one, two, four or six hours (in duplicate except for the one-hour treatment), and collected by scraping into 50 mM HEPES pH 8.5, 9 M urea, 150 mM NaCl and protease inhibitors (Roche). Lysates were rotated end-over-end at room temperature for one hour, and then centrifuged at 15,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 20 min. Soluble lysate containing 20 mg protein was reduced (5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 45 min at 37 °C), alkylated (15 mM iodoacetamide (IAA), 20 min at room temperature in the dark) and quenched (5 mM DTT, 15 min at room temperature in the dark). Proteins were pelleted by chloroform–methanol precipitation, resuspended in 8 M urea, 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, diluted to 4 M urea and digested for four hours at 37 °C with lysyl endopeptidase (Wako) at an enzyme-to-protein ratio of 1:100. The sample was diluted further to 1.3 M urea and subjected to overnight enzymatic digestion at 37 °C with sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega) at an enzyme-to-protein ratio of 1:50. The peptides were acidified with 20% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, final concentration 1%), centrifuged at 18,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 15 min and desalted using a Sep-Pak C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; column (Waters).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 500 µg of eluted peptides from each treatment was lyophilized and reserved for global proteome abundance. The remaining eluted peptides were lyophilized and used for K-ε-GG analysis. For global proteome samples, 100 µg of peptides from each sample was dissolved in 20 mM HEPES pH 8.0 at 1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Isobaric labelling was performed using TMT11-plex reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each unit (0.8 mg) of TMT reagent was allowed to reach room temperature immediately before use, pelleted in a benchtop centrifuge and resuspended with occasional vortexing in 41 µl anhydrous acetonitrile (ACN) before mixing with peptides (29% final ACN concentration). After incubation at room temperature for one hour, the reaction was quenched for 15 min with 20 µl of 5% hydroxylamine. Labelled peptides were combined in equimolar ratios and dried. The TMT-labelled sample was re-dissolved in 80 µl 0.1% TFA and centrifuged at 16,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;, and the supernatant was processed further. Offline high-pH reversed-phase fractionation was performed on a 1100 HPLC system (Agilent) using an ammonium formate buffer system. Peptides (400 µg) were loaded onto a 2.1 × 150 mm, 3.5-µm 300 Extend-C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; Zorbax column (Agilent) and separated over a 75-min gradient from 5% to 85% ACN into 96 fractions (flow rate = 200 µl per min). The fractions were concatenated into 24 fractions, mixing different parts of the gradient to produce samples that would be orthogonal to downstream low pH reversed-phase LC–MS/MS.

Labelled peptides were combined, dried and resolubilized in 0.15% TFA for high-pH reversed-phase fractionation using a commercially available kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Fractionation was performed with a modified elution scheme in which 11 fractions were collected (F1, 13.5% ACN; F2, 15% ACN; F3, 16.25% ACN; F4, 17.5 ACN; F5, 20% ACN; F6, 21.5% ACN; F7, 22.5% ACN; F8, 23.75% ACN; F9, 25% ACN; F10, 27.5% ACN; and F11, 30% ACN) and then combined into 6 fractions (F1 + F6, F2 + F7, F8, F3 + F9, F4 + F10 and F5 + F11).

All samples were analysed with a total run time of 180 min. The Orbitrap Lumos collected FTMS1 scans at 120,000 resolution with an AGC target of 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. FTMS2 scans on precursors with charge states of 3–6 were collected at 15,000 resolution with CID fragmentation at a normalized collision energy of 35%, an AGC target of 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; (proteome) or 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; (K-ε-GG) and a max injection time of 100 ms (proteome) or 200 ms (K-ε-GG). Synchronous precursor selection (SPS) MS3 scans were analysed in the Orbitrap at 50,000 resolution with the top eight most intense ions in the MS2 spectrum subjected to HCD fragmentation at a normalized collision energy of 55%, an AGC target of 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; and a max injection time of 100 ms (proteome) or 350 ms (K-ε-GG).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MS data were searched using Mascot against a concatenated target–decoy human database (downloaded August 2017) containing common contaminant sequences, and the protein sequence of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; NleL ligase with a precursor mass tolerance of 50 ppm, 0.8 Da fragment ion tolerance and tryptic specificity up to 2 (proteome) or 3 missed cleavages (K-ε-GG). For global proteome analysis, the following modifications were considered: carbamidomethyl cysteine (+57.0214), TMT-labelled N terminus (+229.1629) and TMT-labelled lysine (+229.1629) as static modifications, and oxidized methionine (+15.9949) and TMT-labelled tyrosine (+229.1629) as variable modifications. For analysis of K-ε-GG peptides, TMT-labelled diglycine-modified lysine (+343.2059) was also included as a variable modification. Peptide spectral matches for each run were filtered using linear discriminant analysis to an FDR of 2% and subsequently in aggregate to a protein-level FDR of 2%. TMT-MS3 quantification was performed using Mojave, and only peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) that had isolation specificities greater than or equal to 0.5 were considered for the final dataset. The abundance of ubiquitylation on each peptide or each identified protein was estimated by using a model fitted with Tukey median polish summarization with imputation of missing values below a censoring threshold of 28. For each pairwise comparison, the change in abundance (log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ‘fold’ values) and the results of an ANOVA test were reported. We used the implementation of these methods in MSstats v.3.16.0 (ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 49" title="Choi, M. et al.

The soluble lysate was passed through a 2-µm filter. NTA Superflow resin (QUIAGEN) or TALON Superflow (GE Healthcare) were used for affinity purification. The resin was incubated with the clarified lysate at 4 °C for one hour and then washed with up to 2 l of wash buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 5 % glycerol and 1 mM TCEP or 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). Proteins were eluted in wash buffer supplemented with 250 mM imidazole pH 8.0 (Sigma). NleL proteins were concentrated and purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol and 1 mM TCEP.

Embryos were collected at E10.5 by euthanizing pregnant females according to approved protocols and collecting embryos in ice-cold PBS-FBS (Life Technologies, 14190250) and 1% Fetal Bovine Serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10439016) on ice. After dissection, embryos were fixed overnight with 4% paraformaldehyde (50-980-487, Fisher Scientific). The next day, embryos were washed in a series of methanol and PBST, PBS and 0.1% Tween (ThermoFisher Scientific, 28320) series containing 0, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% methanol (Millipore Sigma, 34860) and stored at −20 °C overnight. Rehydration steps were performed in reverse order of methanol and PBST. Processing for in situ hybridization followed RNAscope manufacturer’s protocols (323100, ACD Biosciences). Embryos were incubated with Protease Plus solution for 15 min, washed in PBST 3 times and then fixed in 4% PFA for 20 min. Embryos were washed again in PBST and then incubated overnight in probes for &lt;i&gt;Bmp2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Irx4&lt;/i&gt; (ACD Biosciences, 406661-C2 and 504831). The remaining protocol was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols supplemented with Opal 480 and Opal 620 fluorescent dyes that bound to probes in channel 1 and channel 2 (Akoya Biosciences, FP1495001KT and FP1500001KT). Embryos were then kept in DAPI solution overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec12"&gt;Light sheet microscope imaging&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the RNAscope procedure was completed, stained E10.5 embryos were embedded in 1.5% low melt agarose gel (ThermoFisher Scientific, 16520050) resuspended in ddH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and loaded into a 1 ml syringe. Embryos were allowed to solidify in low melt agarose inside of the syringe for at least 1 h at room temperature. A volume of 5 ml of clearing solution, EasyIndex (LifeCanvas Technologies, NC2379687), was added to a separate 15 ml conical tube. The 1 ml syringe containing the embryo in solidified agarose gel was carefully placed in the 15 ml tube, ensuring the samples were partially submerged in the EasyIndex solution. To shield the samples from light exposure and evaporation, the 15 ml tube with sample were wrapped with foil paper and kept at 4 °C for 48 h to ensure proper clearing. Following the clearing process, the samples were ready for imaging using the SmartSPIM Light Sheet Microscope (LifeCanvas Technologies). Samples were glued to a sample holder and immersed in an index-matched imaging solution, with EasyIndex having an index of 1.52. Acquired images were analysed using Imaris software (Oxford Instruments).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec13"&gt;Generation of CRISPRa knock-in hiPSCs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pC13N-dCas9-BFP-KRAB transgenic construct was modified for CRISPRa&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 42" title="Chavez, A. et al.

Each sample used in aggregation was identified by time point and replicate and assigned a unique name in metadata as ‘gem.group’. For day 10 and day 20 differentiation samples, quality control filtering included removal of outliers due to number of unique molecular identifies and genes (nFeature_RNA &amp;gt; 2,000 and nFeature_RNA &amp;lt; 8,000), unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts (&amp;lt;30,000) and mitochondrial percentage (&amp;lt;15%). Cell cycle scores were added using the function CellCycleScoring. SCT normalization was then performed with regression based on cell cycle scores (vars.to.regress = c(“S.Score”, “G2M.Score”)). Principal components analysis and batch correction using FastMNN was then performed on sample basis using split.by = “gem.group”. Clustering was then run using the functions RunUMAP, FindNeighbors and FindClusters and the output UMAP graphs were generated by DimPlot. Marker genes were identified by the function FindAllMarkers with standard settings. After initial processing, we performed iterative rounds of filtering poor quality clusters and re-running clustering workflows. Cluster annotation, based on expression of known marker genes, was performed manually to assign clusters with an identity. Differential gene expression of disomic and trisomic cells was performed using the Wilcoxon test between two groups with the function FindMarkers (logfc.threshold = 0.25 and min.pct = 0.1).

Following the generation of bam alignment files as output of cellranger count, we used the preconfigured function get_barcodes.py as well as a whitelist of all 218 sgRNA sequences contained within our library to first generate a table of cells, barcodes (sgRNA sequences), read counts and UMI counts&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 56" title="Hill, A.

We then filtered the final output for a minimum and maximum number of read counts to eliminate noise in barcode assignment, allowing us greater confidence in attributing cells with single guide integration. All cells with no guides or more than one guide assignment were not considered for further analysis. Lastly, we then matched cell barcodes in the Seurat object to the output of filtered amplicon barcodes and assigned sgRNA sequence to a specific cell as a metadata value. All cells were associated with one of the 66 candidate chromosome 21 genes and all 20 ‘non-targeting control’ sequences were considered together as control cells. Fold changes were calculated by averaging the exported the log-normalized values for target genes containing all cells with cognate sgRNA sequence compared to all control cells. For the main CROP-seq screen results, clustering was first performed to identify the AVCM population and then log-normalized values for all cells containing a single guide RNA were exported for statistical modelling to develop a trisomy versus disomy classifier. To calculate the Gini coefficient for evaluation of sgRNA evenness, we used the R package DescTools and applied the Gini function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial attempts to perform hit selection in CROP-seq involved using edgeR, WGCNA and traditional differential expression tests in Seurat (Wilcoxon rank-sum test)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" title="Robinson, M.

We also performed Euclidean distance measurements: to compare CRISPRa perturbations with disomic and trisomic reference states, we projected cells into a one-dimensional axis defined by centroids of disomic and trisomic controls using log-normalized expression values of DEGs. For each cell, we computed a Euclidean similarity score bounded between −1 and +1, where −1 indicates maximal similarity to the disomic centroid, +1 indicates maximal similarity to the trisomic centroid and 0 indicates equidistance between the two. Density distributions of these scores were generated for all CRISPRa guides (grey) overlaid with control groups (green, disomic; red, trisomic).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owing to limitations in cell number and likely contributions of dropout effects, we were unable to achieve significant results in differential testing. Therefore, we adopted an approach that involved a statistical classifier described in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec28"&gt;Statistical model generation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A penalized generalized linear model (logistic regression with L1 penality) selected genes with expression predictive of labelled disomic or trisomic cells (scikit-learn pipeline: SelectKBest(n = 5000), RobustScaler(), LogisticRegression(C = 0.1, penalty = ‘l1’, solver = ‘liblinear’, class_weight = ‘balanced’, random_state = 0)). Training data was log-normalized scRNA-seq counts combined from three separate iPSC differentiations to increase power. The model identified nine genes (&lt;i&gt;TIMP1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;NDUFV3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ATP5PF&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;BANCR&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;APP&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;REEP5&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CHCHD2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;DGKB&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BRWD1&lt;/i&gt;) sufficient for accurate prediction on held-out cells. A shallow tree-based gradient boosting model obtained similar results. The third iPSC differentiation was most similar to the CROP-seq cells; therefore, an unpenalized linear model was trained on only the third differentiation using these nine genes and scored how trisomic each cell was in unlabelled CROP-seq data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each CRISPRa target gene had three different guide RNAs. Cells received a low, disomic-like score if: (1) they were negative controls; (2) their CRISPRa target gene did not drive the cell into a trisomic-like state; or (3) their CRISPRa target gene drove the cell into a trisomic-like state, but the effect had diminished. To identify candidates in the presence of noise caused by case 3, we removed all cells with a score less than the 75th percentile of negative controls and then removed guides having fewer than 20 cells after filtering. We sorted remaining guides by the median trisomic score of their cells and tested the top five candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A UMAP projection was fit using expression of model-selected genes in differentiation 3 (umap-learn; n_neighbors = 15, metric = ‘chebyshev’, init = ‘spectral’). We then projected labelled cells from differentiation 3 as well as unlabelled CROP-seq cells into 2D space, showing which CROP-seq cells co-clustered with disomic and trisomic cells, as well as those in a partially trisomic state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec29"&gt;scATAC–seq&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec30"&gt;Sample preparation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day 20 cardiomyocytes from DS1 and DS2U cells were prepared for scATAC–seq according to the manufacturer’s protocols (Chromium Next GEM Single Cell ATAC Library &amp;amp; Gel Bead Kit, 16 rxns PN-1000175). In brief, day 20 cardiomyocytes were isolated by dissociation with 0.25% trypsin as previously described. Nuclei isolation was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols (CG000169, Rev E). For each replicate, 10,000 cells were loaded per sample and, after library preparation, samples were sequenced on Illumina Novaseq S4 and/or Novaseq X (Illumina, software v.1.5), according to the manufacturer’s guidelines for scATAC–seq sequencing protocols (reads 1 and 2: 50 cycles, i7 and i5: 8 and 16 cycles, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec31"&gt;Data preparation and analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;scATAC–seq analysis was previously described using the R package ArchR&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 24" title="Ranade, S.

In brief, indexed fragments files for all samples were first used as inputs to generate a sample-specific Arrow file, including both sequencing-derived data and sample metadata. An aggregated project (ArchRProject) was then created after filtering for quality control (transcription start site (TSS) score and minimum and maximum number of fragments per cell). Clustering using iterative latent sematic indexing (LSI) was then performed on the 500 bp TileMatrix followed by batch correction with Harmony and visualization with UMAP.

Using this advantage, a piggyBac transposon-based targeting construct was designed to insert a C-terminal 3×Flag tag before the &lt;i&gt;HMGN1&lt;/i&gt; stop site in exon 6 of the &lt;i&gt;HMGN1&lt;/i&gt; locus in the DS2U-dCas9-VPR line. The targeting construct had a piggyBac transposon contained a CAG promoter driving a puromycin-thymidine kinase (PuroΔTK) as positive and negative selection cassette inserted between 477 bp of 5′ homology arm conjugated with 3×Flag tag and 466 bp of 3′ homology arm. The 3×Flag tag and a piggyBac transposon selection cassette were installed into the &lt;i&gt;HMGN1&lt;/i&gt; locus via CRISPR–Cas9–gRNA (gRNA targeting sequences: ATATGGTTATTAATCAGACTTGG)-based homologous recombination. Successfully targeted clones were selected using puromycin (0.8 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and verified by PCR (primer pair for 5′ arm verification: 5arm-ver-F: CACATCGAACTCACTACCCAGT and 5arm-Ver-R: GCGTACTTGGCATATGATACACTT; primer pair for 3′ arm verification: 3arm-ver-F: GATGCGGTGGGCTCTATGGCTT and 3arm-ver-R: GCACTCTCTATGATGTTCACGCA) and Sanger sequencing. Following confirmation of targeting, the correct targeted clone was subsequently transfected with piggyBac transposase mRNA and subjected for a negative selection with 1 mM ganciclovir and 0.25 μM FIAU (Both from Sigma Aldrich) for transposon excision. Successful transposon excised clones with a seamless 3×Flag integration upstream of the &lt;i&gt;HMGN1&lt;/i&gt; stop site were verified by PCR (forward primer: GTGACCTCAGCTTGGAGTGTACA; reverse primer: CTGACACCCGAGACAGTCAGAG) and Sanger sequencing. 3×Flag-tagged &lt;i&gt;HMGN1&lt;/i&gt; expression was further confirmed by cDNA PCR with reverse transcription (forward primer: GCCCAAGAGGAAGGTCAGCT, reverse primer: CGAGACAGTCAGAGCCTCCCAT) and Sanger sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec33"&gt;CUT&amp;amp;RUN genome occupancy analysis of day 20 cardiomyocytes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiomyocytes differentiated from hiPSCs were collected at day 20 for CUT&amp;amp;RUN analysis. Cells were dissociated using 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (1×) (Gibco, 25200-072) and neutralized with 1% FBS in PBS. For each condition, 150,000 cells per sample were processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions using the CUTANA CUT&amp;amp;RUN Kit (Epicypher, 14-1048). Cells were first washed and bound to activated Concanavalin A (ConA)–coated magnetic beads in the bead activation buffer. Nuclei were permeabilized with digitonin-containing buffer, and all buffers were supplemented with cOmplete Mini, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Millipore Sigma, 11836170001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samples were incubated with 0.5 µg of H3K4me3 primary positive control antibody (Epicypher 13-0060), 1 µl of IgG control antibody, and 1 µg of monoclonal anti-Flag M2 (Sigma Aldrich, F1804-200µG) per sample at 4 °C overnight on a rotating mixer. After antibody binding, samples were washed by cell permeabilization buffer. Protein A-MNase fusion enzyme was added to each sample and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with mixing. Targeted chromatin digestion was initiated by adding calcium-containing digestion buffer and incubating at 0 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped with stop buffer supplemented with glycogen and RNase A, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min to release digested chromatin fragments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DNA was purified using phenol-chloroform extraction or DNA Clean &amp;amp; Concentrator kit (Zymo Research), followed by SPRIselect bead cleanup (Beckman Coulter, B23317) and 80% ethanol washes. Elution was performed with 0.1× TE buffer, and DNA concentration was measured using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Q32851). Libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (NEB, E7645), indexed with i5/i7 dual indices, and amplified by PCR. Library DNA size distribution was assessed using the Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent, 5067-4626). Final libraries were pooled and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500/550 using the Mid Output v.2 kit (Illumina, 20024904) with the following cycle configuration: read 1: 75 bp, index 1: 8 bp, index 2: 8 bp, read 2: 75 bp.

De-duplicated IgG bigWig signal was then subtracted from averaged sample bigWig files using bigWigCompare v.3.5.0 --operation subtract. Box and whisker plots were generated by first converting gene names into region bed files using the R packages biomaRt, data.table, dplyr and GenomicRanges. Gene regions of interest were manually constructed where chr = getBM chromosome name, start = getBM_start_position-10000, and end = getBM_end_positon+10000. Exported bed files were used as input to deeptools multiBigWig summary, yielding coverage intensity matrix file sin.npz format, which were then read into R using numpy and reticulate. Statistical significance in difference of coverage intensity means was calculated using th aov() and tukeyHSD(aov_result) functions from Stats v.4.3.3 (ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test). Compact-letter display annotations of statistical significance were created using the multcompLetters4() function from multcompView v.0.1-10 package.

In brief, 500,000 cells were pelleted, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored on dry ice for shipping to Azenta. DNA extraction, quality control assessment, quantification and library preparation were performed to the manufacturer’s protocols. Next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were also performed by Azenta. Sequencing adapters and low-quality bases in raw reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic 0.39. Cleaned reads were then aligned to the &lt;i&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/i&gt; GRCh38 reference genome using Sentieon 202112.01. Alignments were then sorted and PCR and optical duplicates were marked. Single-nucleotide variants and small insertion–deletions were called by using Sentieon 202112.01 (DNAscope algorithm). The VCF files generated by the pipeline were then normalized (left alignment of insertion–deletions and splitting multiallelic sites into multiple sites) using bcftools 1.13. Overlapped transcripts were identified for each variant and the effects of the variants on the transcripts were predicted by Ensembl VEP 104.

In brief, two synthetic sgRNAs (Synthego) were designed to mediate a 5.7-kb deletion on a single allele. One sgRNA (5′-AAGGGAAACCAACTGTAATT-3′) targeted a PAM site created by a single-nucleotide variant unique to one allele; the second sgRNA (5′-GTCGGCAAGAAAGGCTATCC-3′) targeted all three alleles, albeit in an intronic region. Ribonucleoprotein complexes were nucleofected into DS1 human iPSCs (passage 52) using the P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector X Kit (Lonza, V4XP-3032). Cells were maintained on hESC-qualified Matrigel in E8 Flex medium (Gibco) and, 48 h after nucleofection, single cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting into 96-well plates using a FACSAria III Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences) to establish clonal cell lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genomic DNA was extracted using QuickExtract DNA Extraction Solution (Lucigen), and a 3-primer PCR was used to screen for heterozygous deletions (primers: 5′-CCCCACGCATCTTGTTCAAG-3′, 5′-CGGGGTGAATTGGGTTCGA-3′, 5′-CCAGAAACGACCCTCGTGCA-3′).

The virus was eradicated in the UK in 1966, but there have been several outbreaks since and it continues to pose a major threat to pig farming worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Classical swine fever is a devastating disease for livestock and farmers as we saw with the outbreak in the UK, 25 years ago,” said Helen Crooke, mammalian virology deputy leader at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), where the pig trial was performed. “Hopefully this breakthrough can help bolster the resilience of the livestock sector to the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Classical swine fever, also known as hog cholera or pig plague, causes fever, skin lesions, convulsions, diarrhoea – and often death within 15 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the UK, periodic outbreaks since the 1960s, have led to the culling of 75,000 pigs. And in countries such as China, Russia and Brazil, where the disease is endemic, CSF is controlled through costly and labour-intensive vaccination programmes and international trade restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Christine Tait-Burkard, a group leader at the Roslin Institute, said: “This virus has a severe effect on animal welfare and productivity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The latest study, the first to demonstrate resistance through gene editing, targeted a gene responsible for producing a protein called DNAJC14. This protein had been shown to play a critical role in the replication of pestiviruses (the virus family that includes CSF) once they enter the cell. Previous studies in cells had found that altering just a few letters of the DNA code blocked viral replication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the latest study, scientists at the Roslin Institute created a line of pigs with the same precise edits to their DNA. Four of the pigs were then exposed to CSF, along with four control pigs, at APHA’s biosecure facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A week after inoculation, the control animals were showing symptoms of the disease and had high levels of the virus in their blood. By contrast, the gene-edited pigs were completely healthy and showed no signs of infection. Several generations of gene-edited pigs were monitored and no adverse effects on health or fertility were observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The same gene is involved in the replication of pestiviruses that infect cattle and sheep – less severe diseases, but ones that continue to circulate in the UK – and the team is now investigating whether the same edit confers resistance for these species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The advance comes as many countries are relaxing rules around gene editing in agriculture, with the UK’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/nov/02/scientists-dismayed-as-uk-ministers-clear-way-for-gene-editing-of-crops-but-not-animals" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Precision Breeding Act&lt;/a&gt; paving the way for gene-edited crops. Countries including the US, Japan and Brazil have already approved gene-edited livestock. Based on previous work at Roslin, Genus, a company based in Basingstoke, has generated pigs that are resistant to a virus that causes porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, which have been approved for sale in the US and are expected to go on the market there in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="d32ffb06-942b-4e9c-846a-356bea728b3e" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":11,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Scientists dismayed as UK ministers clear way for gene editing of crops - but not animals","elementId":"d32ffb06-942b-4e9c-846a-356bea728b3e","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/nov/02/scientists-dismayed-as-uk-ministers-clear-way-for-gene-editing-of-crops-but-not-animals"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Simon Lillico, research scientist at the Roslin Institute and a co-author, said: “In my mind there is a moral imperative that if we can make animals that are disease resistant then we probably should do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Emily Clark, of EMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institute, who was not involved in the research, said: “Decades of genomic research have made it possible to pinpoint and precisely edit the genes involved in disease resistance.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find the cause of hypothyroidism, like Hashimoto’s disease or iodine deficiency, to help guide treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask for a full thyroid panel to uncover hidden causes and tailor your care plan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pair medication with quality sleep, stress management and healthy eating for better thyroid health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Receiving a new health diagnosis can feel overwhelming—especially one that affects your daily energy, mood and metabolism. When your doctor tells you that you have &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/hypothyroidism-diet-foods-to-eat-and-to-avoid-11686188" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;hypothyroidism&lt;/a&gt; (an underactive thyroid), it’s normal to feel a flood of questions about what that means and what steps you should take next. The good news? You’re not alone, and the path forward is more manageable than it might seem.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To help you navigate the early stages of your diagnosis, we spoke with health experts about what to prioritize right away. Here’s what they recommend.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-determine-the-root-cause"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 1. Determine the Root Cause &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the most critical first steps is to understand &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you have hypothyroidism—the diagnosis alone isn’t the full picture. Multiple factors can lead to an underactive thyroid, and identifying the specific reason is key to managing your condition effectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The very first thing you should do is confirm the root cause of your hypothyroidism with the right lab tests,” says &lt;a href="https://drchristinemaren.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Christine Maren, D.O., IFMCP, MSCP&lt;/a&gt;. She explains the importance of this step: “Hypothyroidism can come from different causes (Hashimoto’s, iodine deficiency, postpartum thyroiditis, etc.). Jumping straight to medication without understanding why risks missing autoimmune disease, nutrient imbalances or related conditions.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Most common causes [of hypothyroidism] are autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto) or iodine deficiency. It’s crucial to determine this right in the beginning because it can predict the course of the disease and guide towards any dietary recommendations,” &lt;a href="https://drmeena.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Meena Malhotra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://drmeena.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;, M.D., ABOM, ABIM&lt;/a&gt;, added. Identifying the root cause not only helps tailor treatment but also empowers patients to make informed decisions about their health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-ask-for-a-full-thyroid-panel"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 2. Ask for a Full Thyroid Panel &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To uncover the root cause, you’ll likely need more than a standard TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) test. “I highly suggest getting a full thyroid panel including thyroid antibodies,” says &lt;a href="https://inutritioncenter.com/about/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Vanessa Imus, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.  A comprehensive set of tests, often called a full thyroid panel, provides a more detailed view of your thyroid function. This can help you and your health care provider understand if an autoimmune condition is at play.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One key component of a full thyroid panel is testing for thyroid antibodies, which can reveal whether your immune system is attacking your thyroid. This is a hallmark of Hashimoto’s disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “A majority of diagnosed hypothyroidism in the U.S. is actually Hashimoto’s disease. This is important to know so that you can take steps to reduce the risk of additional autoimmune diseases down the road, since Hashimoto’s disease greatly increases the risk for developing another autoimmune disease,” says Imus.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Identifying these antibodies early can provide clarity on the underlying cause of your condition and guide your treatment plan, including dietary or lifestyle changes that may help reduce inflammation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-discuss-medication-with-a-provider"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 3. Discuss Medication with a Provider &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For some, medication may be prescribed immediately after a diagnosis. “Once your doctor has diagnosed you with an underactive thyroid and determined that you need treatment, the first thing to do is start on levothyroxine therapy,” &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1669632196/rachel-pessah-pollack" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Rachel Pessah-Pollack, M.D., FACE&lt;/a&gt;, suggests. She explains that this medication works by restoring your thyroid hormone levels to a normal range. “This medication is a way to normalize your thyroid levels and help relieve potential symptoms you may have with an underactive thyroid (common symptoms include fatigue, constipation, dry skin, hair loss and weight gain),” Pollack adds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The timing of your dose and what you consume around it can affect how well it works. “If you are diagnosed with hypothyroidism and prescribed thyroid medication like levothyroxine, be sure to discuss with your doctor and pharmacist how to take and schedule your medication to maximize absorption,” advises &lt;a href="https://www.alexisappel.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alexis Appel, RDN&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-focus-on-lifestyle-adjustments"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 4. Focus on Lifestyle Adjustments &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While medication is a cornerstone of treatment, lifestyle factors play a role in how you feel, especially if your hypothyroidism is caused by Hashimoto’s disease. Addressing these areas may help support your overall health and manage the autoimmune component of the disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These changes don’t have to be drastic or extreme. Instead, think of them as small habits you can begin and build on over time. According to Imus, “If you identify that Hashimoto’s disease is the cause of your hypothyroidism, then you’ll want to take steps to regulate your immune system. This requires focusing on gut health, sleep hygiene, stress management, nutrient deficiencies and an anti-inflammatory diet.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Starting small with one of these areas, like prioritizing sleep or finding simple ways to manage stress, can make a meaningful difference.
&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;A vaccine that prevents one of the most painful infections around could be good for your brain and heart, too. New research out this week shows the shingles vaccine is linked to a lower risk of several serious health conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at Case Western Reserve University examined the health records of Americans over the age of 50. Those protected against the viral infection were less likely to develop heart disease, stroke, and a common form of dementia, they found. The findings are the latest to suggest that shingles can cause long-term consequences throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The lingering threat&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/shingles/symptoms-causes/syc-20353054"&gt;Shingles&lt;/a&gt; is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, the same germ responsible for chickenpox in children. Chickenpox typically causes a brief, if miserable, bout of illness. But afterward, the virus can survive and lie dormant in our bodies for decades. When our immune system weakens, either due to age or other factors, varicella-zoster can then reawaken and spark shingles.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the second time with varicella-zoster is usually much worse. Shingles can cause excruciating pain and distinctive rashes that last for several weeks. Even after the infection is beaten back again, some people can be left with lingering, potentially lifelong nerve pain.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the shingles vaccine is highly effective at preventing its return and is widely recommended for adults over 50. In recent years, studies have also started to indicate that this protection extends beyond the infection itself.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Protection for the brain and heart&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this latest study, the researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 174,000 adults in the U.S. They tracked the health outcomes of people vaccinated for shingles for up to seven years and compared them to similar people who instead received the pneumococcal vaccine—another vaccine recommended for older people. This second group acted as a sort of control.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;All in all, compared to controls, people vaccinated for shingles had a 27% lower risk of being diagnosed with blood clots and a 25% lower risk of heart attack or stroke. They also had a 50% lower risk of vascular dementia, a form of the condition caused by blood vessel damage in the brain, and a 21% lower overall risk of dying during the study period.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings were recently presented at IDWeek 2025, the annual conference of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and other related organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Shingles is more than just a rash—it can raise the risk of serious problems for the heart and brain,” said study author Ali Dehghani, doctor of internal medicine at Case Western Reserve University’s School of Medicine, in a &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/news--publications-new/articles/2025/shingles-vaccine-lowers-risk-of-dementia-major-cardiovascular-events/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; released by the IDSA. “Our study findings show that the shingles vaccine may help lower those risks, especially in people already at higher risk for heart attack or stroke.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This type of research is observational, meaning it can’t directly prove a causative link between shingles vaccination and a reduced risk of these conditions. But other studies have also supported the idea that preventing shingles can prevent &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-shingles-vaccine-could-be-a-secret-weapon-against-heart-attacks-2000598150"&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/unique-study-is-latest-to-show-shingles-vaccine-can-prevent-dementia-2000583567"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;. So given the already well-established benefits of the vaccine, these findings should just provide added motivation to get your shingles shots as soon as you’re eligible (the only currently approved vaccine is a two-dose series).&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

In recent years, research has also shown that the brain's blood vessels play an important role in how the disease develops. Yet despite decades of progress, this deeper understanding has not led to fully effective treatments. The main obstacle has been the uncertainty around the exact biological chain of events that leads to brain cell loss.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Toxic Interaction Between Amyloid and Blood Proteins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New findings now reveal a damaging partnership between two key molecules: amyloid beta (Aβ), a peptide known for forming plaques, and fibrinogen, a major blood protein involved in clotting. When Aβ attaches to fibrinogen, it produces unusual clots that resist breakdown. These stubborn clots are linked to inflammation and damage in blood vessels, and even very small amounts of the complex appear to set off early signs of Alzheimer's, including loss of synapses, swelling in the brain, and leaks in the blood-brain barrier. The results strengthen the case that vascular dysfunction contributes directly to neurodegeneration and highlight a promising new therapeutic target: the Aβ/fibrinogen complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It takes a larger amount of Aβ or fibrinogen alone to cause serious damage in the Alzheimer's brain," says Erin Norris, research associate professor in the laboratory of Sidney Strickland at Rockefeller. "But when the two complex together, you only need very small amounts of each to cause damage. There's a synergistic effect with Aβ and fibrinogen."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigating a Long-Standing Hypothesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strickland's Patricia and John Rosenwald Laboratory of Neurobiology and Genetics has been studying this Aβ/fibrinogen link for almost twenty years. Earlier work from the group showed that Aβ binds to fibrinogen and connected that interaction to the progression of Alzheimer's disease. At the time, the idea that blood vessel problems could play a major role in Alzheimer's was controversial. "Only recently, with a number of breakthroughs in the field, did people begin to believe that the vascular system is involved in AD pathogenesis," Norris says. "Since our initial findings, we've been focused on studying the mechanisms that explain how a dysfunctional vascular system impacts AD."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying the complex was only the beginning. The researchers wanted to know how much damage it could cause on its own. They recreated low concentrations of the Aβ/fibrinogen complex in the lab and applied it to thin slices of mouse brain tissue as well as to living mice. This allowed them to observe its effects under tightly controlled conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We wanted to really show the damage -- to zoom in on exactly how pre- and post-synaptic terminals were being harmed," says Research Associate Elisa Nicoloso Simões-Pires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their experiments revealed that while Aβ and fibrinogen alone caused little harm, even small amounts of the combined complex led to major problems. It damaged synapses, increased inflammation, and disrupted the blood-brain barrier -- all signature features of Alzheimer's disease. When the researchers used antibodies that stopped Aβ from binding to fibrinogen, the harmful effects were significantly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We showed that the complex actually induces blood-brain barrier leakage, when the proteins alone did not," Simões-Pires says. "Disruption of the blood-brain barrier allows for blood proteins to cross into the brain, which lead to additional harm."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clues to Early Alzheimer's and Potential Treatments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One strength of the study is that it used both isolated brain tissue and live mice. "It was an in vitro and in vivo project, both providing the same outcome," Norris says. "We are much more confident in our results when we can show the same thing in culture and in a living organism." Next, the team plans to explore the mechanism -- why does this complex cause so much trouble?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may also be clinical implications, because the study suggests that even small amounts of the Aβ/fibrinogen complex can trigger the features of Alzheimer's disease long before cognitive symptoms appear. Mice exposed to the complex, for instance, also showed elevated levels of phospho-tau181, a biomarker used in humans to detect Alzheimer's years before symptoms arise. This result raises the possibility that the current study is mimicking the earliest stages of AD progression and that early intervention targeting the complex itself could delay or prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many mechanisms contribute to Alzheimer's, the team believes this particular pathway deserves more attention. "It's not a simple disease," Simões-Pires says. "A lot of other factors can induce neurotoxicity, and we certainly do not propose that inhibiting this complex formation would cure AD. But perhaps targeting this complex would alleviate some of the pathologies and be even more effective in combination with other therapies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These discoveries bring researchers one step closer to understanding how damage spreads in the Alzheimer's brain -- and how stopping a single toxic interaction could make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

This association that exhaustion automatically means quicker sleep may not always work. If exhausting yourself to sleep was your tactic, maybe, from the mental fatigue of reading a boring academic book, you need a more well-rounded strategy to fix this issue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=""&gt; &lt;span class=""&gt; &lt;picture&gt; &lt;source media="(max-width:767px)" srcset="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/10/22/550x309/insomnia_1749640606473_1761134101106.jpg" alt="If you are unable to sleep despite being exhausted, your daytime habits are to blame.

He shed light on an interesting root cause. “Why do you find it difficult to fall asleep even when you are exhausted? As a neurosurgeon, I will tell you how your daytime habits are ruining your nights,” he said. This means your choices during the day determine how well you sleep at night. The neurosurgeon suggested 4 tips for modifying daily activities which make you sleepy at night. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Walk more&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the culprits is prolonged inactivity. Many people sit for long hours during the day, whether at the office on weekdays or lounging on the couch bingewatching over the weekends. Dr Katakol shed light on this aspect, saying, "Walk more than you sit during the day.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Dim the lights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once the sun sets, lower the lights around," the neurosurgeon advised. It's important to dim the light before bedtime. This involves switching from bright overhead lights to warm bedside lamps. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. No screens before bedtime &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life is hectic, rushing in the morning, grabbing anything within reach for breakfast, grinding it out at the office, pushing for deadlines and attending meeting after meeting. The chase is simply relentless. So often, people consider evening as their downtime, catching up on TV shows or vapid doomscrolling. But this stretches all the way up to bedtime or even beyond. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The neurosurgeon flagged this habit and emphasised, “Put your screens away 3 hours before your bedtime.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Early dinner&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last fix Dr Katakol recommended was having an early breakfast.“Finish your dinner early, ideally before sunset and take a 20-minute walk subsequently," he advised. This habit lowers digestive discomfort. What happens is that when one eats dinner too close to bedtime, the digestive process is disturbed. To improve &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/nutritionist-suggests-1-way-refrigeration-to-maximise-benefits-of-carbs-in-your-diet-aid-digestion-promote-weight-loss-101759736764003.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="digestion"&gt;digestion&lt;/a&gt;, as the neurosurgeon shared, it's vital to go for brief walks so that the stomach doesn't feel bloated in bed. And when your stomach is heavy, you are likely to toss and turn more. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Neurosurgeon Dr Katakol's advice is to continue these habits ‘sincerely’ to see the results. In others, you will have to be consistent with these healthy changes to sleep better. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This report is based on user-generated content from social media.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15xkcd006o26nkbj3j4emt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Weight loss drugs are proving to be super popular among many workers with job-based health insurance. But GLP-1 medications are busting their employers’ budgets, leading some firms to rethink their coverage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000b356nwyypmzry@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The share of very large firms covering these drugs for obesity soared to 43% this year, up from 28% last year, according to KFF’s latest annual &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kff.org%2Fehbs&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CTami.Luhby%40cnn.com%7Cc69cf664776b4c40810908de100dc423%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638965848813438983%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=IniV8PEDIsA5e3qIr0csq9UENlHcJO0on2bkGaZXtzI%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;Employer Health Benefits Survey&lt;/a&gt;, which was released on Wednesday. These employers, who have more than 5,000 workers, are much more likely than their smaller counterparts to offer such a benefit.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000c356n3krydd27@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among firms with between 200 and 999 staffers, only 16% provide coverage of drugs for weight loss this year, the same as last year, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000d356n9k9f6erz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            GLP-1 drugs, which treat diabetes, obesity and certain other conditions, have been in great demand since they came on the market a few years ago because they help patients shed pounds. While employers typically cover the medications for diabetes, fewer of them do so for weight loss, in part because of the drugs’ high prices — which have also &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/08/health/weight-loss-drug-insurance-denials/index.html"&gt;limited Americans’ access&lt;/a&gt; to them. The list price of Wegovy, for instance, is about $1,350 for a month’s supply, though discounts are available.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000e356n474nvlle@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Employers, however, recognize that covering the medications for weight loss is a valuable benefit to attract and retain talented staffers. Notably, even among firms that don’t do so, nearly half said the benefit is “very important” or “important” for employee satisfaction. More than 36 million people with job-based insurance have a body mass index that would medically qualify them for a GLP-1 drug.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000f356n456eun78@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Large employers know these new high-priced weight-loss drugs are an important benefit for their workers, but their costs often exceed their expectations,” Gary Claxton, KFF senior vice president, said in a statement. “It’s not a surprise that some are rethinking access to the drugs for weight loss.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000g356n8fnvp1z6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Costs are higher than forecast because more workers are taking advantage of the benefit, KFF found. Nearly 60% of large firms said usage of the medications for weight loss is higher than they predicted, while two-thirds of such employers said the impact on their prescription drug spending was “significant.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000h356n8j6boi8f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One employer KFF surveyed found that it spent more on GLP-1 medications than any other drug this year, up from 32&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; place last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000i356nzh04gyih@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A large retailer told KFF, “Before we knew it, we spent half a million dollars and we’re projected to go up to $1.2 million the following year.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000j356nk42d22xt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The high costs of GLP-1 drugs have long been a source of frustration for many Americans. President Donald Trump set off a kerfuffle last week when he said that the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/17/health/ozempic-trump-oz"&gt;medications&lt;/a&gt; would soon be available for $150, prompting Mehmet Oz, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator, to step in and say negotiations are ongoing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000k356n1wgxwp3o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many employers told KFF they were looking at reducing coverage of the drugs through steps such as limiting eligibility to those with higher body mass indexes or requiring workers to participate in weight management programs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000l356nweh83jjv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You have to have a coach, and then you can only stay on it for a certain amount of time before you have to get reevaluated,” one large manufacturer told KFF.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000m356nq90t3bsg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other firms told KFF they have decided to drop the benefit for weight loss.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000n356n05wwvanj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, employers will likely have to reconsider their coverage again in coming years, especially as more workers demand coverage, and the drugs are approved for even more medical conditions. Plus, prices coming down.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000o356n7431ymgd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re still writing the story of what GLP-1 coverage looks like in employer plans,” said Matthew Rae, associate director of the Program on the Health Care Marketplace at KFF.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000q356nsp2gk5xy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            GLP-1 drug costs – and prescription drug prices in general – are also contributing to a rise in premiums.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000r356nawov76si@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Annual insurance coverage for a family hit $27,000, on average, this year, up 6% from 2024, according to KFF’s survey. Workers contribute $6,850 toward the cost, on average, while employers pick up the rest of the tab.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000s356nfkh0ly5a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Meanwhile, individual coverage topped $9,300, on average, this year, up 5% – with employees shouldering $1,440 of the cost and employers paying the rest.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000t356nvlscox5a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Over the past five years, the growth in premiums has been largely in line with inflation and wage increases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000u356njd36arps@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/04/business/health-insurance-premiums-cost-increase"&gt;coverage for 2026&lt;/a&gt; could be much pricier, according to several benefits consulting firms. KFF also points to GLP-1 medications, hospital prices and tariffs as factors that could push up premiums and out-of-pocket costs for workers next year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh15ze54000v356ncdv3zyr6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is a quiet alarm bell going off,” Drew Altman, KFF’s CEO, said in a statement. “Employers have nothing new in their arsenal that can address most of the drivers of their cost increases, and that could well result in an increase in deductibles and other forms of employee cost sharing again, a strategy that neither employers nor employees like but companies resort to in a pinch to hold down premium increases.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

As well as changing the way someone’s body looks on the surface, the results show that feminizing hormones have impacts at a molecular level, with implications for susceptibility to various health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by scientists at the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute (MCRI) in Victoria, Australia, included 40 adult trans women receiving one of two common forms of gender-affirming hormone treatment: estradiol, coupled with either cyproterone acetate or spironolactone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A suite of 5,279 blood proteins was examined before starting treatment and after six months. The proteins from the participants were also compared against &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/hidden-changes-to-us-health-data-swapping-gender-for-sex-spark-fears-for-public-trust-79894" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from cisgender women taken from the UK Biobank, a long-running study of 500,000 people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the researchers discovered was that over time, receiving hormones caused protein changes in the trans women that made them more closely align with those in &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/sex-and-gender-operate-differently-in-the-brain-finds-study-of-nearly-5000-kids-75133" target="_blank"&gt;cisgender women&lt;/a&gt;. Of the top 100 proteins that normally differ between males and females, 36 and 22, respectively, shifted towards the “female” form in the trans women after either hormone regimen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were similar to what is seen in &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/menopause-misconceptions-what-actually-causes-the-symptoms-of-menopause-63920" target="_blank"&gt;menopausal&lt;/a&gt; women who receive &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/new-drugs-heart-health-and-chimpanzees-heres-the-latest-in-menopause-research-76493" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;hormone replacement therapy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For transgender women we found gender affirming hormone therapy alters the levels of many protein biomarkers that reflect what happens clinically,” explained senior author and MCRI Associate Professor Boris Novakovic in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1102367" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This may go onto impact the risk of allergic and autoimmune diseases, which tend to affect more females, but decrease the risk of heart disease, more commonly seen in males. This highlights that human biology is malleable and that even in adulthood, our bodies respond to sex hormone changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as decreases in some protein biomarkers linked to male reproduction, there were also increases in proteins involved in body fat, breast development, immune function, and good heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decrease in proteins linked to sperm formation was particularly notable in the group receiving cyproterone, which was put down to the fact that this particular combination treatment causes a greater drop in testosterone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings could have implications for how transgender people receiving hormones are monitored over the long term. Novakovic said that as well as considering aspects of health that are unique to trans women, it’s important that providers recognize that trans women may also face similar health challenges to cisgender women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equally, these findings could help optimize hormone therapy itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Studying proteins could help with the development of personalised treatment approaches by monitoring the effectiveness of gender affirming hormone therapy in trans women and help us with early detection of potential side-effects on heart health or immune function,” explained co-author Professor Ada Cheung. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was relatively small and only looked at feminizing gender-affirming hormones, so more research will be needed to assess whether similar changes may be seen in &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/gender-affirming-mastectomies-have-an-overwhelmingly-low-regret-rate-70184" target="_blank"&gt;transgender men&lt;/a&gt; or non-binary individuals receiving masculinizing hormones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been established that &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/male-and-female-mammals-have-different-pain-receptors-and-we-dont-know-why-74613" target="_blank"&gt;biological sex&lt;/a&gt; affects the risk of certain diseases – females are more prone to autoimmune conditions, but males are more susceptible to a range of infectious diseases, for example. Gender-affirming hormone therapy is an &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/hormone-therapy-in-teens-associated-with-better-mental-health-for-transgender-people-62209" target="_blank"&gt;important treatment&lt;/a&gt; for many trans and non-binary people experiencing gender dysphoria, so a better understanding of how it impacts the body – even down to the molecular level – is vital to protect the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/genderaffirming-hormone-therapy-is-not-bad-for-young-hearts-new-study-reports-59767" target="_blank"&gt;long-term health&lt;/a&gt; of this patient population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04023-9" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 12:07:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixAFBVV95cUxPaFc1NERqTElhdmdMcHBuWi1HUmFZNGpXRUZGaXNpRFkyLXg2cFNaVEhEdDNpMnplbXZ6ZDNhbUdwcC15Q1BZOU91anRVMlpOZkNZUmpiQVZBWTdOb3FXM1NaQUtnblpoQXpMMlZCcXhrZDVXVi16V1BYejhWY1pSLU9rZ2tBeXljREF1bVkweVA1bzhqZ0ZWWmNSRDhuY3RCbTRILWk5WTFYS3RNUDZZang3QkQwMTg1eHJJMVNOblRGZG5L</guid></item><item><title>在感冒和流感季节，最小的孩子真的是最致命的-美联社新闻</title><link>https://apnews.com/article/germs-school-young-kids-c34402a127916b474ead2711b500fbe7</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="LeaderBoardAd-Mobile "&gt;

Any caregiver knows that the real signs of fall are kids with &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-flu-school-attendance-4845073e737db87f786e1d8c815a48f7" rel="nofollow"&gt;coughs, sneezes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and sniffles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autumn marks the start of respiratory virus season, when colds, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/flu-vaccine-shot-flumist-04144eb736ad1adced5252dae0c4985b" rel="nofollow"&gt;flu and other bugs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; start circulating — especially among the very young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study confirmed what many families intuitively know: The littlest students harbor the most germs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children in pre-kindergarten and elementary school showed highest rates of virus detection compared with older students and staff, according to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/156/4/e2025070886/203957/Respiratory-Virus-Detection-and-Acute-Respiratory?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;research published&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the journal Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Young children can have up to 10 respiratory viruses a year as their immune systems are introduced to different infections for the first time,” said Dr. Jennifer Goldman, a pediatrician at Children’s Mercy hospital in Kansas City, Missouri, who co-led the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Younger kids were more likely to have virus detected&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and her colleagues analyzed nasal swabs and symptom reports from more than 800 students and staff in a large school district in Kansas City from November 2022 to May 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that overall, more than 85% of all participants had at least one respiratory virus detected during that time and more than 80% had an episode of acute respiratory illness — though not necessarily at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More telling, 92% of pre-K and elementary school kids had a virus detected, compared with about 86% of middle school students, about 77% of high school students and 76% of staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Infobox" data-module data-gtm-region="This article is part of AP's Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health.

    &lt;div class="Infobox-items RichTextBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/be-well" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more Be Well.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pre-K kids, ages 3 to 5, had the highest rates of actual illness, too, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the viruses were the kinds that cause the common cold, including rhinovirus, which was found in 65% of participants, and types of seasonal coronavirus detected in about 30%. The virus that causes COVID-19 was found in about 15% of those studied.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Study confirms the experiences of pediatricians who are parents&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study provides a baseline look at the burden of viruses in school settings, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also confirms the real-world experience of pediatricians who are parents, like Dr. Nicole Torres of the University of Miami Health System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can say this for my own children, who are now in their teens: They were sicker when they were younger,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also squares with older research that found that young kids play a key role in spreading respiratory viruses at home. Dr. Carrie Byington was co-author of a &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/61/8/1217/376653" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;University of Utah study,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; published in 2015, that recruited 26 households to take nasal samples from everyone living in a home, every week, for a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That study found that children younger than 5 had virus detected for half of the weeks of the year, recalled Byington, who is now with the University of California, San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And if you live in a household with multiple children, that proportion just goes higher, so it can appear as if someone is always sick,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;How to prevent illness — or at least try to&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-flu-rsv-health-virus-5b074238b82a08bc6eef9e0ddb20f326" rel="nofollow"&gt;Preventing illness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in children at school or at home can be tough, experts acknowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being up to date on vaccinations for COVID-19 and influenza is important, they said. So is frequent handwashing, learning to cover coughs and keeping hands away from the eyes, nose and mouth. Cleaning and sanitizing frequently touched surfaces and objects and optimizing fresh air are also key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When little ones do get sick, the best treatment is often supportive care like extra fluids and rest. In serious cases, medical providers may recommend medications to reduce fever or antiviral drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can take a couple weeks, however, for lingering symptoms like coughs to completely resolve. By then, the child may well have another cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I do tell parents of younger children to expect them to be ill once every month, every month and a half,” Torres said. “It’ll seem that way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihilh008r25pg56cgc6j1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The federal government shutdown has brought respiratory virus surveillance to a halt at the national level, leaving local governments, health systems and the general public with critical blind spots as the season starts to ramp up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa000053b6ngwyj4mdj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Key federal reports on flu, Covid-19 and RSV haven’t been updated in nearly a month, even as virus activity picks up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh10vqrs00043b6qjh70ehgu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These viruses kill tens of thousands of people in the US each year and hospitalize hundreds of thousands more, but they typically follow seasonal patterns and don’t spread as quickly as diseases like measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa000043b6nc5ovmpx6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During a shutdown, national disease surveillance reports are updated only if they “protect from imminent loss of life,” said Dr. Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist and director of the Center for Outbreak Response Innovation at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh208e8f00033b6nkrj2s5hx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The federal government’s measles response is an “active public health intervention” and permitted by law to continue, according to a statement from the US Department of Health and Human Services, but the shutdown “thwarts the CDC’s ability to continue to publish routine flu data from its public health partners”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa100063b6n0eaplexy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s general &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Respiratory Illness Data Channel&lt;/a&gt; – which offers insight into viral activity through trends in early warning signs like &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/index.html?cove-tab=1" target="_blank"&gt;wastewater&lt;/a&gt; surveillance and emergency department visits – was last updated September 26, a few days before the shutdown began. ﻿Weekly updates from the more specific &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/week-38.html" target="_blank"&gt;FluView&lt;/a&gt; have stopped, as have summary reports from &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/resp-net/dashboard/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;RESP-NET&lt;/a&gt; that tracks hospitalizations for Covid-19, flu and RSV from a network of hospitals across the country. At that time, flu and RSV were already showing signs of increasing activity and Covid-19 levels were elevated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0z7rzy000y3b6q9qlxiy77@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the latest 2025-26 respiratory disease season outlook from the CDC, the US “will likely have a similar number of combined peak hospitalizations due to COVID-19, influenza, and RSV compared to last season.” Last season, the agency &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html" target="_blank"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; there were between 610,000 and 1.3 million flu hospitalizations and up to 130,000 flu deaths. There were also hundreds of thousands of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/surveillance/burden-estimates.html" target="_blank"&gt;Covid-19 hospitalizations&lt;/a&gt; and between 44,000 and 63,000 deaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa100073b6nmog5ns7b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For people who manage their health, it’s like weather or traffic reports blinking out,” Rivers said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0z8hue00113b6qqjnaub5b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In response to questions about how the federal government is working to inform the public about respiratory virus risk and plans to adapt if the shutdown lasts long-term, HHS said the shutdown may delay answers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0za5ia00153b6q67q41bop@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The Trump Administration is committed to reopening the government for the American people. During the Democrat-led shutdown, mission-critical activities at CDC will continue,” the agency said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0vyd2p00003b6qr05rj1r4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some information is still being collected by states and reported to the CDC during the shutdown, and it is often made available to the public through state dashboards. But a coordinated national assessment of trends is a necessary part of preparedness, experts say, and that has lapsed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa1000a3b6nvyk7lqrb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The single most important aspect of any response to a problem is communication – clear, sustained communication to the profession and to the general public – and any lack of information impairs that communication,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University and spokesperson for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa1000b3b6nrnp0pxoh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            RSV, for example, follows a predictable pattern each season, experts say: Viral activity starts in the southern part of the country and moves north. &lt;a href="https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/respiratory-illness/respiratory-syncytial-virus/_documents/2025-w41-rsv-summary.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Activity&lt;/a&gt; is already on the rise in Florida, and two outbreaks were reported in the southeastern part of the state, Rivers noted in her latest newsletter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa1000c3b6n9bihkuek@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Without national coordination, however, other states and local jurisdictions might lack visibility into Florida’s trends and other cues they’ve historically used to plan for their own response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa1000d3b6nx6dt8x4g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The severity and progression of each flu season can be quite unpredictable, experts say, but national analysis of data and trends can help make the season’s outlook less blurry.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa1000e3b6nzidskqtg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s the old scouting motto, ‘Be prepared,’” Schaffner said. “The information is so important to everyone in the health care world because it allows hospitals and clinics and emergency rooms to brace for what’s coming. It allows them to anticipate what their staffing needs are, their supplies … and take care of patients in a much more coherent fashion.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa1000f3b6nwnbsdegi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            National surveillance also helps capture more comprehensive data on the virus variants that are circulating, he said, which can help raise the alarm about a potentially more severe season if the vaccine isn’t a good match or about the rise of any particularly concerning varieties such as bird flu.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa1000g3b6ndd4geuih@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Laboratory testing capacities at the CDC and expert guidance to analyze local trends may also be hampered during the shutdown, experts say. Lack of visibility on emerging threats is of particular concern because of surveillance pauses. Many&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;CDC researchers will also miss IDWeek, the largest annual meeting of infectious disease experts in the nation, because of the shutdown.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa1000h3b6namioawfj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many people have also come to use federal respiratory virus information to manage their own health. Infectious diseases don’t stay within state boundaries, and experts say many folks want a broader view of the situation – particularly if they’re traveling for the holidays.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh10otdz00013b6qy3ncp20x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It can drive some decisions around vaccination, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa1000i3b6n2725t11w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Anne Zink, former chief medical officer for the state of Alaska, says she knew an epidemiologist who would wait to get the flu vaccine until the data started to show an uptick in activity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa1000j3b6naf5yna5v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “[Protection from] the flu vaccine doesn’t last for that long, so he would want to get it early enough that it would cover him for the season but late enough that it wouldn’t run out before the end of the season,” she said. “So he was always in this space that data needs to be accessible and available to everyone to be able to make that decision.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ypenp00063b6ql3z76vz5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the process may be more complicated and less thorough, it’s still possible to get a read on respiratory virus trends.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0xbtqb00053b6nkcam9cf6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The necessary state and local groundwork to track viruses is continuing, and state health departments are still updating respiratory virus dashboards. Rivers has started compiling all of the publicly available data into her &lt;a href="https://caitlinrivers.substack.com/" target="_blank"&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt; each week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0xebal00083b6noy5bmwuv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Zink recently helped launch the Population Health Information and Visualization Exchange, or &lt;a href="https://www.pophive.org/" target="_blank"&gt;PopHIVE&lt;/a&gt;. Hosted by the Yale School of Public Health, the platform brings public and private health datasets together for a more comprehensive and real-time look at a wide range of health trends than was available before.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0xh6hv000b3b6ncasmluc3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For a long time, the government hasn’t been doing exactly what we needed it to do,” Zink said. “This is a filling a gap that’s existed long before a shutdown, and it’s just now maybe getting a little more attention because of that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ypyzn000a3b6q27apt9kr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With many pathogens, a brief lapse in surveillance – as due to a government shutdown – is manageable, said Dr. John Brooks, an infectious disease physician and expert in HIV prevention who previously served as chief medical officer for CDC’s Emergency COVID-19 Response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0yrd89000e3b6qs4m5z8ot@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There may be a period of delay, there may be a hiccup here or there, but generally it continues. We catch up,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0xhpqe000e3b6nqvunu6tv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But in the meantime, some data and surveillance problems can’t be fixed by cobbling various sources together.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa100113b6nk1yo6gcl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “As a general principle, the places where you’ll see problems arising first are in those pathogens that are transmitted most quickly and spread most rapidly,” Brooks said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa100123b6n8obsauz8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/health/measles-outbreaks-utah-arizona-south-carolina"&gt;outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; continue to cause dozens of cases each week in the US, and the CDC has maintained weekly data reporting accordingly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa100133b6n53lzlyt0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu can also spread quickly, which makes “the need to be on top of the data even more acute” than for something like HIV, Brooks said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa100153b6n3bz95sv0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But there’s a deeper concern about losing visibility on certain groups that are most affected by particular pathogens because of broader policies of the Trump administration. Soon, transgender people will no longer be reported in federal surveillance for HIV, despite having one of the highest diagnosis rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0yycj5000q3b6q774eeb2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recently formed groups such as the West Coast Health Alliance and the Northeast Public Health Collaborative — in which state health departments have banded together to issue public health guidance separate from the CDC — may be a “needed second perspective” when it comes to tracking disease, Brooks said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0ihwa100173b6nquv1060c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the work of the groups has been more focused on counterbalancing flawed guidance and policy from the CDC, Brooks said, forming these relationships now&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;also puts them “one step ahead” if the need arose to fill gaps in data surveillance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0xi2d5000h3b6ng1c2ku1f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In all cases, though, surveillance data creates “that fidelity of information to make sure that you are not missing where problems occurring, and so that you can bring the resources necessary to those persons to protect them and take care of them,” Brooks said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0zhgg3001r3b6qc5jofj2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say that a pause in respiratory virus surveillance was an expected consequence of the government shutdown. Once it’s over, though, the actions the government prioritizes to ramp reporting back up will be important to watch.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0zhgg3001s3b6qbwq6av23@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When there’s a shutdown, the catchup is really expensive, so things don’t tend to come up very quickly,” said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who recently resigned as director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. “They tend to take a little bit of lead time because of the need to catch up on whatever’s been left behind.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0zhgg3001v3b6qib0fwnku@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The time needed for that catchup is exacerbated by broader turmoil at the CDC, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0zhgg3001w3b6q5gq2f3qh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to estimates from a local union representing federal workers, about a quarter of the CDC’s workforce – about 3,000 workers – have been fully separated since the beginning of the year. Additional attempted reductions in force, or RIFs could effectively bring cuts to the agency up to a third.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0zhgg3001x3b6q7di625gb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Employees of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases are among the hundreds of CDC workers who were recently &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/12/health/fired-cdc-staffers-reinstated"&gt;fired in error and reinstated&lt;/a&gt; the next day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0zhgg3001y3b6q84bkzbnu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And the Trump administration could use the shutdown as a strategy to delay certain reporting – such as data around vaccine uptake – even longer, Daskalakis said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0zhgg3001z3b6qrrqg1vv9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “National Immunization Survey data as well as other data streams that people tend to look at to see what’s happening with vaccine coverage are also hampered by the shutdown,” he said. Seasonal vaccination coverage is already off to a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/08/health/covid-vaccines-for-children-delay"&gt;slow start&lt;/a&gt; because federal Covid-19 vaccine recommendations came later than usual.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0zhgg300203b6qsxavkikl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It makes me concerned that [the administration] may not prioritize that, so we won’t have visibility into what’s happening on the national point of view for vaccine coverage late into the season,” Daskalakis said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0zhgg300213b6qput5i5oz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As public health &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/health/rfk-approval-cdc-trust-vaccines-kff"&gt;struggles with trust&lt;/a&gt; in the US, experts say that access to timely, accurate data is critical.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh0zhgg300223b6qmhq70rh5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “To deal with an outbreak in the most successful fashion, you have to be able to communicate the latest information quickly to both medical professionals and medical institutions and to the general public,” Schaffner said. “If you don’t have the information, the communication becomes much less precise and much less useful, and that may feed the mistrust, concern and questions that the public has already about the public health system.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

rectally – one of the winners of the 2024 “Ig Nobel” satirical science prize – may one day actually help &lt;a href="/news/health/copd-ild-treatment-lung-disease-singing-benefits-b2835257.html"&gt;lung disease patients&lt;/a&gt;, after achieving a key step in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technique was first demonstrated in 2021 by Japanese researchers, who showed in experimental &lt;a href="/news/science/pig-lungs-human-transplant-surgery-china-b2813923.html"&gt;pig models&lt;/a&gt; that oxygen could be delivered to the body via the rectum in gas form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An enema-like process delivers &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://indy-cms-new-prod.brightsites.co.uk/article/edit/2849950"&gt;super-oxygenated liquid&lt;/a&gt; to the large intestine where the life-supporting gas is absorbed into the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this method of rescuing people with blocked airways led the research team to win a parody award, it might not be a joke after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Med&lt;/em&gt; reports encouraging data from the first human clinical trial to evaluate the potential benefits of this “enteral ventilation” technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first human data, and the results are limited solely to demonstrating the safety of the procedure and not its effectiveness,” Takanori Takebe, an author of the study from the University of Osaka, said. “Now that we’ve established tolerance, the next step will be to evaluate how effective the process is for delivering oxygen to the bloodstream.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Efficacy of anal breathing method examined in mammals such as mice and pigs&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt;

– without it being oxygenated – for 60 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study evaluated the safety of this method in humans for the first time, using a special liquid called perfluorodecalin with exceptional oxygen-carrying ability,” the study authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 20 of them held the liquid for the entire hour, including amounts up to 1,500 ml.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the largest volumes, though, the participants reported feeling abdominal bloating and discomfort, but no serious adverse events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a trial with 27 healthy male volunteers, the authors found that administering this liquid rectally was safe and well tolerated,” the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were hoping to repeat the experiment using oxygenated liquid to measure how much of it was needed and for how long to improve blood oxygen levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This important safety milestone,” they concluded, “paves the way for future studies to see if this technique can help patients with respiratory failure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 10:36:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxQRWk1QjJVNUZ0akpCazNGZ2szVEo0NkVIUFA2c1dfLUluT2FCcmUyZHJHb1FhNEdFczA1YU96S01fdGNVUWpHSTQ2dURrT3pNZ1NXU0I2MHJYWmhfa3BGbGdabk9TaVBHQTNPVGNtUllScjBBdDhZaVRJbnotZnp5c20xaVhmajFWTGNZaTlkVTQ3VFJxVmp1SlhoTUcxbm50dXh3</guid></item><item><title>灰色头发的人，快乐！灰色可能与天然癌症防御有关- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/gray-haired-people-rejoice-the-gray-might-be-related-to-a-natural-cancer-defense-2000675051</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl "&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While graying hair might feel like just one more unpleasant symptom of aging, new research reveals that it may actually be the result of a biological process that defends against cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a study led by the University of Tokyo and published earlier this month in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-025-01769-9"&gt;Nature Cell Biology&lt;/a&gt;, researchers used lab mice to investigate how a type of stem cell reacts to DNA damage, revealing a connection between hair graying and a form of skin cancer called melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;DNA damage, aging, and cancer&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our body’s cells are continuously faced with internal and environmental agents that can cause DNA damage, which plays a role in both aging and cancer. Scientists have struggled to pin down the specifics of this role, especially how damaged stem cells impact tissue health in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-transplant/in-depth/stem-cells/art-20048117"&gt;Stem cells&lt;/a&gt; are cells that can self-renew (make more of themselves) and differentiate (turn into other cells). Within this context, the team specifically analyzed melanocyte stem cells (McSCs)—stem cells that produce mature melanocytes, pigment-producing cells that give color to hair and skin. In mammals, McSCs live in hair follicles in the form of immature melanoblasts (melanocytes’ precursors), where they perpetuate pigmentation.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers found that, in response to DNA double-strand breaks, McSCs permanently differentiate and are then lost, which results in graying—a process called seno-differentiation. However, when McSCs come into contact with some carcinogens, they maintain their ability to self-renew and expand clonally. Simply put, they avoid seno-differentiation even when DNA is damaged, pushing McSCs “toward a tumor-prone fate,” according to a University of Tokyo &lt;a href="https://www.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/imsut/en/about/press/page_00079.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“These findings reveal that the same stem cell population can follow antagonistic fates—exhaustion or expansion—depending on the type of stress and microenvironmental signals,” Emi Nishimura, lead author of the study and a biologist at the University of Tokyo, said in the statement. “It reframes hair graying and melanoma not as unrelated events, but as divergent outcomes of stem cell stress responses.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Two potential fates&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In other words, both results may come from how McSCs react to DNA damage, when they can go one of two ways—differentiate and leave the system (which leads to graying) or carry on dividing, where the persistence of damaged McSCs could ultimately result in a tumor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the researchers emphasize that their research does not indicate that graying hair prevents cancer, it does suggest seno-differentiation to be a protective pathway triggered by stress that does away with possibly detrimental cells.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“McSC fate tracking in mice revealed that McSCs undergo cellular senescence-coupled differentiation (seno-differentiation) in response to DNA double-strand breaks, resulting in their selective depletion and hair graying, and effectively protecting against melanoma,” the researchers explained in the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So next time you or an older family member complains about their gray hair—remember that it might be a trait that naturally protects against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guideline Highlights:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;New guidance on choking in conscious children and adults recommends alternating five back blows followed by five abdominal thrusts, until the object is expelled or the person becomes unresponsive.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Guidance for choking in infants has been updated to alternate between five back blows and five chest thrusts using the heel of one hand, until the foreign object is expelled or the infant becomes unresponsive.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The guidelines provide a new algorithm for treating individuals with suspected opioid overdose, including public access guidance on naloxone use.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The systems of care volunteer writing group elected to revert to a single chain of survival for all forms of cardiac arrest, whether adult or pediatric, in- or out-of-hospital.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Evidence shows that children 12 years old or older can be taught effective CPR and defibrillation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;To improve lay-rescuer response to out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, the guidelines recommend support for media campaigns, instructor-led training and community training.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embargoed until 5 a.m. CT / 6 a.m. ET Wednesday, October 22, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DALLAS, Oct. 22, 2025 &lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;The “2025 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Emergency Cardiovascular Care (ECC),” published today in the Association’s flagship journal, &lt;strong&gt;Circulation&lt;/strong&gt;, marks the first full revision of lifesaving resuscitation guidance since 2020. Among the updates are expanded recommendations for managing choking and suspected opioid overdose, in addition to other lifesaving interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each year, approximately 350,000 people in the U.S. experience an out-of-hospital &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cardiac-arrest/about-cardiac-arrest" target="_blank"&gt;cardiac arrest&lt;/a&gt; – when the heart suddenly stops beating – which results in death 90% of the time, according to the Association’s statistics.&lt;a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; The 2025 CPR guidelines provide an extensive review of the latest science, translating it into clear, lifesaving recommendations that empower people to act when every second counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests caused by respiratory emergencies or asphyxia occur in more than 9% of adults and 39% of children in the U.S.&lt;a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; New guidance on choking recommends alternating five back blows followed by five abdominal thrusts for conscious children and adults, until the foreign object is expelled or the person becomes unresponsive. Choking guidance for adults was not included in the previous guidelines, and earlier guidance for children called for performing abdominal thrusts only. For infants, rescuers should alternate between five back blows and five chest thrusts using the heel of one hand, until the foreign object is expelled or the infant becomes unresponsive. Abdominal thrusts are not recommended for infants, due to the risk of injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guidelines also provide updated recommendations for treating people experiencing a suspected opioid overdose, which is the cause of 80% of all drug overdose deaths worldwide.&lt;a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; According to the World Health Organization (WHO), opioid use can lead to death because opioids affect the part of the brain that regulates breathing. Signs of an opioid overdose include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Slow, shallow or no breathing&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Choking or gurgling sounds&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Drowsiness or loss of consciousness&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Small, constricted pupils&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Blue or grey coloring of the skin, lips or nail beds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time, the guidelines provide public access instruction on when to use naloxone, a medication used to reverse or reduce the effects of opioids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The American Heart Association’s 2025 CPR guidelines represent gold standard science. It reflects a rigorous examination of the most up-to-date evidence that guides how resuscitation is provided for critically ill patients,” said Ashish Panchal, M.D., Ph.D., volunteer chair of the American Heart Association Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science Committee, physician and professor of emergency medicine at The Ohio State University. “As the science continues to evolve, it’s important that we continue to review new research specific to the scientific questions considered of greatest clinical significance that affect how we deliver life-saving care.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Association co-developed the pediatric and neonatal guidelines that help protect the youngest and most vulnerable lives. These chapters were co-led by volunteer experts from both organizations, with writing groups evenly balanced between their members, resulting in a unified set of recommendations that reflect the shared expertise, dedication and vision of both organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside major changes to choking recommendations for infants, the neonatal guidelines provide further direction for treating newborns. For most term and preterm infants not needing immediate resuscitation, delaying umbilical cord clamping for at least 60 seconds – up from the previously recommended 30 seconds – has been shown to improve a newborn’s blood health and iron levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re proud that these guidelines will be jointly published in the American Heart Association journal &lt;strong&gt;Circulation&lt;/strong&gt; and the American Academy of Pediatrics journal &lt;strong&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/strong&gt;. This action underscores our joint commitment to advancing pediatric and neonatal resuscitation — together,” said Javier Lasa, MD, FAHA, FAAP, American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics volunteer and co-chair of the 2025 Pediatric Advanced Life Support Writing Group and associate professor in critical care and cardiology at Children’s Health in Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further updates offer suggestions for increasing lay rescuer intervention in a cardiac emergency, noting that only approximately 41% of adults experiencing cardiac arrest outside of the hospital receive CPR before emergency medical services arrive.&lt;a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; Early CPR could double or triple a person’s chance of survival. New recommendations include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Consolidating the chain of survival into one chain, which highlights the importance of doing compressions and breaths, especially in children and infants. Previously, there were separate chains of survival for adults, infants and children experiencing a cardiac emergency, and for cases of in-hospital and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Aligning with new scientific evidence that suggests children 12 years old or older can be taught effective CPR and defibrillation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Further improving lay rescuer response to out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, by recommending the use of media awareness and education campaigns, increased instructor-led training and expanded community training.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association updates and publishes CPR guidelines periodically, as it has since issuing the first CPR guideline in 1966. The Association also plays a unique dual role in resuscitation—leading global efforts in public awareness, education and policy change, while also serving as the scientific authority that develops the official CPR and emergency cardiovascular care guidelines used by other CPR and first aid training providers in the U.S. and in over 90 countries worldwide. For more than five decades, the Association has trained millions of people each year in CPR, first aid and advanced cardiovascular care through its programs and awareness campaigns. As a founding member of the international committee that shapes lifesaving resuscitation guidelines, the Association ensures the CPR recommendations reflect the most advanced research from global experts around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We know high-quality CPR saves lives, and we need dedicated support to ensure that everyone who needs high-quality CPR receives it,” said Panchal. “That starts with learning it yourself. We encourage everyone to take a CPR class to learn the skills and techniques to provide life-saving care in an emergency. Everyone has a role to play in the chain of survival.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics are releasing new CPR and ECC training materials that reflect the latest guidelines’ recommendations simultaneously with publication, accelerating adoption of the newest science so learners can begin using the most current, science-backed resources immediately. The updated guidelines and CPR training materials will be translated and  trans created into many additional languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association supports the development and publication of clinical practice guidelines without commercial support. Association members, who are experts in resuscitation science, volunteer their time to the writing and review efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

                A new study finds that cognitive training can increase the levels of a key chemical messenger in the brain responsible for decision-making, and reverse a process associated with aging.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Scientists are &lt;a href="https://games.jmir.org/2025/1/e75161" target="_blank"&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; the first compelling evidence in people that cognitive training can boost levels of a brain chemical that typically declines with age.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A 10-week study of people 65 or older found that doing rigorous mental exercises for 30 minutes a day increased levels of the chemical messenger &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557825/" target="_blank"&gt;acetylcholine&lt;/a&gt; by 2.3% in a brain area involved in attention and memory.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The increase "is not huge," says &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/neurology-neurosurgery/etienne-de-villers-sidani-md" target="_blank"&gt;Étienne de Villers-Sidani&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at McGill University in Montreal. "But it's significant, considering that you get a 2.5% decrease per decade normally just with aging."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So, at least in this brain area, cognitive training appeared to turn back the clock by about 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The chemical change observed after intensive brain training is persuasive, says &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/psych/profile/michael-hasselmo-d-phil/" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Hasselmo&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Center for Systems Neuroscience at Boston University, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was compelling enough that I thought, 'Maybe I need to be doing this,'" he says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The result backs earlier &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10613518/" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; in animals showing that environments that stimulate the brain can increase levels of certain neurotransmitters. Studies of people have suggested that cognitive training can &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/28/nx-s1-5477556/aging-brain-health-lifestyle-diet-exercise-social-alzheimers" target="_blank"&gt;improve thinking and memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Never skip brain day &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, comes amid a proliferation of online brain-training programs, including Lumosity, Elevate, Peak, CogniFit and BrainHQ.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But it has been hard to know whether these programs really work, says de Villers-Sidani, who directs the cognitive disorders clinic at McGill's Montreal Neurological Institute.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They had a positive impact on some cognitive measures," he says, "but then the question was, how much is it changing the brain and how is it changing the brain?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So de Villers-Sidani and a team of researchers decided to see whether mental exercise could increase levels of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that's closely associated with cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Acetylcholine levels typically begin a gradual decline around middle age. The levels drop sharply, though, in people with Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team studied 92 healthy people who were 65 or older.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Half the participants spent 30 minutes a day playing computer games like solitaire and Candy Crush.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The others spent the same amount of time each day doing cognitive exercises that are part of the scientifically tested program BrainHQ. The program challenges users to remember the type and location of items that appear and disappear with increasing speed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's really targeted at attention and speed of processing, and it kind of pushes you to the limit," de Villers-Sidani says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The researchers used a &lt;a href="https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/63/Supplement_1/33S" target="_blank"&gt;special kind of PET scan&lt;/a&gt; to detect changes in acetylcholine levels in the anterior cingulate cortex, a brain region that's important for making decisions and detecting errors.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I was not sure we would find anything, to be honest," de Villers-Sidani says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;But they did. In people who played games like solitaire, acetylcholine levels were unchanged. But in people who did cognitive training, there was a significant increase.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Acetylcholine levels also increased in other brain areas, including the hippocampus, which plays a key role in memory.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even modest changes are meaningful, Hasselmo says, because acetylcholine does more than carry messages in the brain. It also modulates the behavior of neurons in ways that affect learning, memory and attention.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So when a person takes, say, a high dose of the motion sickness drug scopolamine — which blocks the effects of acetylcholine — things start to go awry.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you block the neuromodulator function in the brain, a person can't even think," Hasselmo says. "You go into a delirious state."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, even small increases in acetylcholine can have a "profound and notable effect" on memory and thinking in older people.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hasselmo notes that the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8949236/" target="_blank"&gt;earliest Alzheimer's drugs&lt;/a&gt; reduced symptoms by increasing levels of acetylcholine. Now, he says, intensive brain training has the potential to achieve similar gains and stave off cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;

Some, such as yoghurts and kefir, contain probiotics - live strains of bacteria that support gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are now seen as a key way to boost the body's population of 'good' gut microbes, improving the microbiome - the vast community of micro-organisms in the digestive tract linked to better digestion, lower inflammation, stronger immunity and even improved mental wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A growing number of studies back up the claims. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2025 review in Frontiers in Nutrition found fermented foods can ease bloating and improve bowel regularity, while a 2022 analysis by Chinese researchers linked foods such as yoghurt and kimchi to better heart and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some studies have even suggested fermented foods could influence mood via the gut–brain axis, potentially easing symptoms of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-ac6698e0-ae5a-11f0-9795-0f8b275a1f79" class=""&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and anxiety - although scientists stress research in this area is still emerging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A 2025 systematic review in Frontiers in Nutrition found they can ease bloating and improve bowel regularity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There are a host of health benefits from eating fermented foods,' says Dr Sean Preston, Consultant Gastroenterologist at London Digestive Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The primary reason for this is the probiotic, or live bacteria, that is present, which can help digestion and support the gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Theoretically there is also a possible benefit of reducing the risk of bowel cancer by creating a diverse gut microbiome and preventing the production of pro-carcinogenic compounds.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's no wonder, then, that fermented foods have become big business — the global market is now worth an estimated £67 billion and is expected to increase fivefold within the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But experts say the key to unlocking their full benefits is to make them yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shop-bought jars don't always deliver the same punch, as many pickles and fermented-style products are preserved using vinegar rather than natural fermentation with live organisms — meaning they lack probiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To make sure you're getting the real thing, Dr Preston advises looking for labels that say 'naturally fermented', and checking for tiny bubbles in the liquid once opened — a sign that live bacteria are active. Also avoid products with added sugars or preservatives, which can interfere with the fermentation process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With that in mind, here are five fermented foods packed with gut-boosting benefits — and how to make them yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Kefir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kefir is a type of cultured dairy product, rich in probiotics, vitamins and even has antibacterial properties. Research has suggested that fermented milk can boost digestion and help improve the body's immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Kefir has been everywhere recently and that is likely to do with the fact that it is more palatable than many other fermented foods,' says Dr Preston. 'However, that means that many of the supermarket versions are high in sugar and added flavourings, so the benefit will not be as great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A poor kefir is no better than a good natural yogurt for you, however a good quality kefir has a number of added benefits because of the additional lactobacillus bacteria.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has also linked kefir to improved brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A small trial involving people with Alzheimer’s disease found that drinking kefir daily for 90 days led to a 28 per cent improvement in overall cognition and a 66 per cent boost in immediate memory tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Laboratory studies suggest compounds in kefir may also reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain, mechanisms thought to play a role in slowing cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's made by adding kefir grains – a combination of yeast and bacteria – to milk. This results in a thick, tangy beverage that tastes similar to yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although you can buy Kefir for around £3 a litre, kits where you add kefir cultures to milk and let it stand for 24 hours can produce over 100 litres for £15 (plus the milk needed for the recipe).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'Kimchi is great because it tastes great,' says Dr Preston. 'But also the antioxidants in kimchi can also help reduce inflammation. It is also often high in Vitamin C'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Kimchi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Korean staple kimchi is a fiery, tangy mix of fermented cabbage, garlic, ginger and chilli that's been made for centuries as a way to preserve vegetables through the winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During fermentation, friendly bacteria – mainly Lactobacillus – flourish, giving kimchi its signature sourness and a host of potential health perks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have shown these natural probiotics can help support gut health, reduce inflammation and may even play a role in heart and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2022 study by the World Institute of Kimchi, even found that a higher level of consumption of the fermented cabbage was linked to 15 per cent reduction in body mass index (BMI) and a 12 per cent decrease in being obese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Kimchi is great because it tastes great and is easy to incorporate into daily meals,' says Dr Preston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But also the antioxidants in kimchi can also help reduce inflammation. It is also often high in Vitamin C.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-4cf5d620-ae58-11f0-b13b-f1cf793e9980" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15211917/Five-easy-make-fermented-foods-cut-risk-bowel-cancer-gut-health-doctor.html"&gt; &lt;font&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;KIMCHI RECIPE &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;1 medium napa cabbage (about 1–1.5 kg), 1/4 cup sea salt or kosher salt (non–iodized), 4 cups water, 1 tablespoon grated ginger, 4 garlic cloves minced 1 tablespoon sugar, 2–3 tablespoons Korean red pepper flakes (gochugaru, adjust to taste), 4 spring onions chopped, 2 tablespoons fish sauce or soy sauce (for a vegetarian version)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instructions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Salt the cabbage: Cut the cabbage lengthwise into quarters and remove the core. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chop into bite–size pieces. Dissolve the salt in the water, pour over the cabbage in a large bowl, and let sit for 1–2 hours, turning occasionally. The cabbage should wilt and release liquid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rinse and drain: Rinse the cabbage thoroughly under cold water 2–3 times to remove excess salt. Drain well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Make the spice paste: In a separate bowl, combine ginger, garlic, sugar, gochugaru, fish sauce (or soy sauce), and a splash of water to form a thick paste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mix: Add the cabbage, spring onions, carrot, and daikon to the spice paste. Mix well using clean hands (wear gloves if you can, as the chili can irritate skin).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pack and ferment: Transfer the kimchi mixture into a clean glass jar, pressing down firmly so the vegetables are submerged under the liquid. Leave about 2–3 cm of space at the top.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Some studies have linked regular consumption of fermented soy products to improved digestive health and reduced inflammation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold health-ccox mol-style-medium"&gt;Miso&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Miso is a traditional Japanese seasoning made by fermenting soybeans with salt and a type of mold called koji.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sometimes rice, barley, or other grains are added to create different varieties and flavours, ranging from pale and sweet to dark and intensely savoury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The result is a thick paste used in soups, marinades, and sauces, celebrated for its distinctive umami taste and rich nutritional profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fermentation process that creates miso also produces beneficial bacteria and enzymes, which can support gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like other fermented foods, miso contains probiotics that may help maintain a healthy balance of gut microbes – essential for digestion, nutrient absorption, and immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some studies have linked regular consumption of fermented soy products to improved digestive health and reduced inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Miso is also a source of plant–based protein, vitamins, minerals such as zinc, manganese, and copper, and antioxidants that can help protect cells from oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because it's made from soybeans, miso contains isoflavones – naturally occurring compounds that may contribute to heart and bone health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While you are not going to be consuming mountains of miso, it is easy to incorporate into your weekly meals, and it provides a diverse set of bacteria to help the gut microbiome,' says Dr Preston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To make miso at home, cook soybeans until soft, then mash them with koji (a fermented grain) and salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pack the mixture tightly into a container, weigh it down, and leave it to ferment in a cool, dark place for several months to a year, depending on the desired flavor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'Sauerkraut is a great source of fibre, plus an additional source of vitamins that you may not get from other fermented foods,' says Dr Preston&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Sauerkraut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A jar of sauerkraut might look simple, but this humble mix of cabbage and salt is one of the oldest fermented foods in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When cabbage ferments, it becomes naturally rich in beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillus plantarum, along with vitamins C and K and plant compounds that act as antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sauerkraut is a great source of fibre, plus an additional source of vitamins that you may not get from other fermented foods,' says Dr Preston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The key is eating fermented foods little and often and ensuring that you are eating a diverse mix of foods, to ensure maximum benefits.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sauerkraut is made by finely slicing fresh white or green cabbage, then mixing it with salt – usually about 2per cent of the cabbage's weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The salted cabbage is packed tightly into a jar or crock, pressing it down until it releases enough liquid to submerge itself in brine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 09:10:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>禽流感卷土重来--《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/health/h5n1-bird-flu.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 09:02:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE9vQWVnTGpoaUFRaEJiSHlZYzJxaktiOFROUTUyd3AtM093el9FSnFRTnh6d25hbDFxcGFiMVR0YUxFZ3IyUUM4M3NGYmhoeDZoX0R3ZjFrVklEbzRWQXNOcHZ0MHQ1YjJFN3VfcA</guid></item><item><title>“我着火了” ：睾丸激素正在让女性恢复性欲—然后是一些-纽约时报</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/magazine/testosterone-women-health-sex-libido-menopause.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 09:00:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxNRW1yWlVsYmJMalZYRy1PR1VGaGFFV0pyR0U2VFdjc2ZTVThFZ3BMX2gwbFZrbDR5TjZhMnR4VklCYWgxdHppMXhuNERRUEZ0TVVJQnlqSTgzNGxseEZ6ZHY3dHFiRExWb3liZ2oybGRJTl80MUdRT1luMFNJbUlCYXFLbVhuaEVQeTZlZy1FbXBXNi0zRG1iSnlWZw</guid></item><item><title>耐药细菌比抗生素推进得更快-有线</title><link>https://www.wired.com/story/resistant-bacteria-are-advancing-faster-than-antibiotics/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;The proliferation of&lt;/span&gt; difficult-to-treat bacterial diseases represents a growing threat, according to the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance Report. The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/13-10-2025-who-warns-of-widespread-resistance-to-common-antibiotics-worldwide"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; reveals that, between 2018 and 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/antibiotic-resistance"&gt;antibiotic resistance&lt;/a&gt; increased by more than 40 percent in monitored pathogen-drug combinations, with an average annual increase of 5-15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;According to data reported by more than 100 countries to WHO's Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS), one in six laboratory-confirmed bacteria in 2023 proved &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-antibiotic-resistance-crisis-has-a-troubling-twist/"&gt;resistant to antibiotic treatment&lt;/a&gt;, all related to various common diseases globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Superbugs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;For the first time, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240116337/"&gt;this edition of the report&lt;/a&gt; includes prevalence estimates of resistance to 22 antibiotics used to treat urinary tract, gastrointestinal, bloodstream, and gonorrheal conditions. The analysis focused on eight common pathogens: &lt;em&gt;Acinetobacter spp&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;non-typhoidal Salmonella spp&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Shigella spp&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The results show that resistant gram-negative bacteria pose the greatest threat. Of particular note are &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;, which are associated with bloodstream infections that can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death. "More than 40 percent of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; and more than 55 percent of &lt;em&gt;K. pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; strains worldwide are now resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, the first-choice treatment for these types of infections," the report warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;These microorganisms are joined by &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Acinetobacter&lt;/em&gt;, which are also developing resistance to essential drugs such as carbapenemics and fluoroquinolones. This reduces therapeutic alternatives and forces the use of last-resort antibiotics, which are often expensive and difficult to access, especially in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Medicine Lags Behind&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Antimicrobial resistance is outpacing advances in modern medicine, threatening the health of families worldwide," said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in a statement. "We must use antibiotics responsibly, and make sure everyone has access to the right medicines, quality-assured diagnostics, and vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Optimizing surveillance systems and obtaining accurate data is an urgent task. Although there has been progress, it is still insufficient. Between 2016 and 2023, the number of countries participating in GLASS quadrupled from 25 to 104. However, 48 percent did not report data in 2023, and almost half of those that did report lacked sufficient infrastructure to generate reliable data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;WHO warns that addressing this problem must be a priority in regions such as Southeast Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean, where one in three reported infections is resistant, as well as in Africa, where one in five has the same condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxOZjl1R2RhOXpfTFl6UnhRYmlvUFdfR201bm9adFJHSTZCa1NMbUpmbFRGSjJuanRvVnE2RXBxVnhNaEV3YnNFdmtudEVsTGFUeGxsaVd1a3lsUEZqV3lGc0Q4YmZINDh6WnZVcnJJX2puYzNYdVktbTRpQlcxQ2w3R1hkYWRZdHBYbElfNEl3</guid></item><item><title>斯坦福大学首位女性法学博士/医学博士候选人--《斯坦福日报》</title><link>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/10/21/stanford-sees-its-first-female-j-d-m-d-candidate/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="elementor-widget-container"&gt;
					
&lt;p&gt;Josie Pearce ’26 J.D. M.D. ’29, always knew that she wanted to be a lawyer. What she didn’t expect was to become a doctor too. Now she is the first female J.D./M.D. candidate at Stanford, according to her law school advisor Elizabeth Di Giovanni, who cited records from the registrar’s office. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As one of just a handful of J.D./M.D. candidates in Stanford’s history, she’s now carving a unique path at the intersection of law, policy and medicine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I was one of those kids where people said, ‘You would make a good lawyer.’ I don’t know if that’s really a compliment but nonetheless, a lot of my law school friends were told that at a very young age,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pearce graduated from Dartmouth College in 2020 with a degree in government. After graduation, she began working as a legal assistant in Boston. However, her passion for medicine soon led her to enroll in Harvard’s post-baccalaureate Premedical Program while working full-time. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I remembered back to high school, liking science, despite taking zero science classes at Dartmouth as a government major. I thought, if I did this, I would combine my passion for law, public health and health policy. That was where the dream was born,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pearce’s interest in medical school stems from her personal experience with lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease. She has been an advocate for the disease since she was a teenager, highlighting her experiences through competition in pageants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’ve had lupus since I was 15, and around 2021, I completely changed my diet and lifestyle. I went plant based and started focusing on sleep and exercise. So I went from someone who was on medication and told, ‘You’re going to be on this medication for the rest of your life,’ to getting off medication,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Juggling law and medicine degrees is no small feat, but Pearce says that she has become used to the balancing act.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was a ton of work to be working full-time at a law firm and doing a post-bacc. I would finish a whole day of work and then be like, ‘Oh no, I have to go take my chemistry exam.’ It wasn’t super normal, but I just loved it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Pearce, a southern California native, Stanford was an obvious fit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Stanford produces innovators. They admit people who are so excited to do things that have never been done before and then give them every resource imaginable to go after their goals. I wanted to come to a place where I was excited to do both degrees and the institution was excited about it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pearce is now in her first year of medical school, and is using her credits to count toward her final year of law school. She is president-emeritus of the Veterans Legal Assistance Program at Stanford Law School and is on the Stanford Law Review. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Like a grandma, I’ve been going to bed at 8:30 p.m. recently. Ultimately, I’ve been trying to stay healthy and just focus on getting enough sleep every single night,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Through her journey, Pearce aims to start conversations about the connection between diet, lifestyle and health. Though she is unsure what career she wants to pursue after graduation, Pearce hopes to work in health policy, with a specific focus on food and nutrition. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“How are people eating? How are people best able to spend SNAP dollars? These are things I want to influence so that Americans are no longer dying from diseases that are completely preventable with lifestyle changes,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
