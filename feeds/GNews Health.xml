&lt;p&gt;Both prune juice and whole prunes are effective in treating constipation, Jow said. However, there are some differences to consider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole prunes have more fiber because the juicing process removes some. An 8-ounce serving of one &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/1102758/nutrients" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7899410" data-affiliate="true"&gt;cup of prune juice&lt;/a&gt; contains about 2.5 grams of fiber, while a &lt;a href="https://www.med.umich.edu/mott/pdf/mott-fiber-chart.pdf" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7899410" data-affiliate="true"&gt;serving of 10 prunes&lt;/a&gt; contains about 6 grams of fiber. Moreover, “whole prunes have double the amount of sorbitol in the same serving size compared to prune juice,” Jow said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another advantage of whole prunes over prune juice is that prune juice has more sugar and calories than dried prunes. While this may not make a difference if you only consume prune juice once in a while, it can add up over time, Jow cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Jow, the “bottom line” is that both prune juice and dried prunes will help you go. If you prefer the taste of prune juice, you will still get the laxative benefits prunes provide, but whole prunes are a healthier choice, and you won’t need as many servings to get the same amount of fiber and sorbitol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long does it take for prunes to relieve constipation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will vary from person to person, ranging from “a few hours to a day,” Jow said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help things along, Jow advised, “It is important to drink plenty of water while taking prunes to stay hydrated and help enhance the effectiveness of the prunes and the function of the digestive system.”   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many prunes do you need to get things going?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of prunes you need to relieve constipation “varies depending on age and severity,” Jow said. To start, he suggests giving children one to two prunes or 2-4 ounces of prune juice a day. For adults, Jow recommends starting with three to five prunes or half a cup of prune juice daily or twice daily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you have too many prunes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When backed up, drinking an entire container of prune juice or down handfuls of dried prunes may be tempting. That might be especially true if the recommended amounts aren’t working for you. However, Jow urges caution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is possible to eat too many prunes,” leading to unwanted side effects, he said. “Excess fiber can cause gastrointestinal discomfort, bloating, gas and even diarrhea. Sorbitol is a natural laxative, so consuming too large of a quantity can also cause increased bowel movements and diarrhea,” Jow explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because everyone reacts differently to prunes, Jow suggests starting with a small amount and gradually increasing consumption until you get the desired effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wood also cautions that because prunes, like all dried fruit, are high in sugar and calories, those with “advanced or uncontrolled diabetes” use a sugar-free over-the-counter laxative. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-do-prunes-make-you-poop-doctors-explain-their-ringing-endorsement_l_65946316e4b0912833ae13ea" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7899410"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The team at the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.phage-collection.org/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Phage Collection Project&lt;/a&gt; sent me some vials to collect samples, along with a pair of gloves.

I didn't flush the toilet after a poo and left it for a couple of hours. I pop on a glove and hold my breath as I go in for the final sample. Strict hygiene instructions, including vigorous hand-washing, were followed, at all times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The vials were packaged up for collection and then three days later I headed off to the University of Southampton to see what was inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"They were a bit dirty when I received them," phage scientist Michelle Lin tells me as we don our blue lab-coats and matching gloves to go into the Containment Level 2 microbiology laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;We grab my samples from the fridge, which look much clearer now they have been filtered of any… debris. "It's fine, it's needed," Michelle, who had the unpleasant job, reassures me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Michelle Lin holding the cleaned up sample of my toilet water&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Filtering is the first step in looking for phage, next they get served dinner – a cocktail of yummy bacteria - to help them grow in number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Now comes the really cool bit – finding a useful phage. The scientists have been working with the local hospital to collect bacteria from patients with troublesome infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Michelle grabs a petri dish that's growing bacteria from a patient with a painful, urinary tract infection that keeps coming back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;And to my amazement – one of the phage I collected from my toilet was able to kill this infection in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The way to see that the phage has infected bacteria is you get these zones where the bacteria are not growing and that's because they've been killed by the phage," says Michelle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;The small off-white areas are where the bacteria are still growing, but in most of the sample petri dish there are dead zones where the phage has gorged on the bacteria&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;You can see the leopard print pattern in the petri dish where the phage have been making light work of a bacterial infection that modern medicine was struggling to shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"As crazy as it sounds, well done to the toilet sample," says Michelle with great delight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;And when I was offered the chance to name the phage, well of course it's the Gallagher-phage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Sounds amazing to me," says Michelle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So far this is all good fun in the laboratory, but could my phage ever be given to a patient?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Yes and I hope so," says associate professor Dr Franklin Nobrega as we look at images of my phage captured with an electron microscope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;The virus has been named the Gallagher-phage, after me&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Your phage, already in just 24 hours, we were able to get in a high concentration and able to be a very good killer, which means this is very promising for patients, so thank you," said Dr Nobrega.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Phage remind me of a moon lander – a big capsule on spindly legs – just instead of landing on the surface of the moon they use their legs to select their victim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They then hijack the bacteria and transform it into a mass-production factory for more phage, which burst out of their host, killing it in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There are pros and cons to phage. They reproduce as they go along so you don't need constant doses like you would with drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They are also very picky eaters. You need a precise match between phage and the strain of bacteria you're trying to treat whereas antibiotics tend to kill everything good and bad. So it is harder to find the right phage, but if you do it comes with fewer side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Nobrega tells me infected wounds are a "very good application" for phage because you can apply them directly to the injury, but they can also be inhaled via a nebuliser to treat lung infections or to target urinary tract infections "which is our target currently".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250616-143050-043f96f72f-web-2.23.1-5/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bd2b/live/1628e0c0-5367-11f0-a0b2-13bcfa16c1d6.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images The phage has a five spindly legs a corkscrew body and then atop it sits an angular capsule.

The drugs are also used to make organ transplants, open surgery and chemotherapy possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The predictions around antibiotic resistance are very frightening, but the reality is we're seeing it now and it's only going to get worse," says Prof Paul Elkington, the director of the institute for medical innovation at the University of Southampton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;The Phage Collection Project team at the University of Southampton are keen to get samples from the public&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He is also a doctor with a speciality in lung medicine and is already at the point where - after a year of treatment and turning to ever more toxic and less effective antibiotics - "in the end you have to have a conversation [and say] 'we can't treat this infection, we're really sorry'".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He says we can't rely solely on antibiotics in the future and phage are a potential alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But he warns the steps needed to get from the laboratory and into patients are "uncharted".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Things are changing.

			&lt;p&gt;Around &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)60142-7/fulltext"&gt;15 percent of the world's population&lt;/a&gt; suffers from tinnitus, a condition which causes someone to hear a sound (such as ringing or buzzing) without any external source. It's often associated with &lt;a href="https://rnid.org.uk/information-and-support/tinnitus/tinnitus-causes/"&gt;hearing loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only can the condition be annoying for sufferers, it can also have a serious effect on mental health, often causing &lt;a href="https://www.tinnitus.org.uk/tinnitus-and-stress"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30909841/"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;. This is especially the case for patients suffering from tinnitus over months or years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's currently &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00802/full"&gt;no cure for tinnitus&lt;/a&gt;. So finding a way to better manage or treat it could help many millions of people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And one area of research that may help us better understand tinnitus is sleep. There are many reasons for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-ear-wax-might-hold-clues-to-early-parkinsons-study-finds?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Your Ear Wax Might Hold Clues to Early Parkinson's, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, tinnitus is a phantom percept. This is when our brain activity makes us see, hear or smell things that aren't there. Most people only experience phantom perceptions &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/dreams"&gt;when they're asleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for people with tinnitus, they hear phantom sounds while they're awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second reason is because tinnitus &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26373470/"&gt;alters brain activity&lt;/a&gt;, with certain areas of the brain (such as those involved in hearing) potentially being more active than they should be. This may also explain how phantom percepts happen. When we sleep, activity in these same brain areas also changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article/4/3/fcac089/6563428?login=false"&gt;recent research review&lt;/a&gt; has identified a couple of brain mechanisms that underlie both tinnitus and sleep. Better understanding these mechanisms – and the way the two are connected – could one day help us find ways of managing and treating tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_105568" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-105568" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed-642x260.jpg" alt="Woman Asleep On Bed" class="wp-image-105568 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-105568" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Some of the same brain mechanisms underlie both sleep and tinnitus. (Catherine Delahaye/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sleep and tinnitus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we fall asleep, our body experiences multiple stages of sleep. One of the most important stages of sleep is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22811426/"&gt;slow-wave sleep&lt;/a&gt; (also known as deep sleep), which is thought to be the most restful stage of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During slow-wave sleep, brain activity moves in distinctive "waves" through the different areas of the brain, activating large areas together (such as those involved with memory and processing sounds) before moving on to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's thought that slow-wave sleep allows the brain's neurons (specialized brain cells which send and receive information) to recover from daily wear and tear, while also helping sleep make us feel rested. It's also thought to be important for our &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30923474/"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every area of the brain experiences the same amount of slow-wave activity. It's &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15184907/"&gt;most pronounced&lt;/a&gt; in areas we use most while awake, such as those important for &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10009"&gt;motor function&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3524543/"&gt;sight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sometimes, certain brain areas can be overactive during slow-wave sleep. This is what happens in sleep disorders such as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5806559"&gt;sleep walking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar thing may happen in people with tinnitus. We think that hyperactive brain regions might stay awake in the otherwise sleeping brain. This would explain why many people with tinnitus experience &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8373941/"&gt;disturbed sleep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929664620301066"&gt;night terrors&lt;/a&gt; more often than people who don't have tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_127397" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-127397" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow-642x260.jpg" alt="man sleeps on blue pillow" class="wp-image-127397 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-127397" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Sleep and tinnitus appear to have an important connection. (Juanmonino/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinnitus patients also spend more time in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24005841/"&gt;light sleep&lt;/a&gt;. Simply put, we believe that tinnitus keeps the brain from producing the slow-wave activity needed to have a deep sleep, resulting in light and interrupted sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even though tinnitus patients have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24005841/"&gt;less deep sleep on average&lt;/a&gt; than people without tinnitus, the research we looked at in our review suggests that some deep sleep is hardly affected by tinnitus. This may be because the brain activity that happens during the deepest sleep actually suppresses tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of ways the brain may be able to suppress tinnitus during deep sleep. The first has to do with the brain's neurons. After a long period of wakefulness neurons in the brain are thought to switch into slow-wave activity mode to recover. The more neurons in this mode together, the stronger the drive is for the rest of the brain to join.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that the drive for sleep can get strong enough that neurons in the brain will eventually go into slow-wave activity mode. And since this especially applies to brain regions overactive during wakefulness, we think that tinnitus might be suppressed as a result of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slow-wave activity has also been shown to interfere with the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30356042/"&gt;communication between brain areas&lt;/a&gt;. During deepest sleep, when slow-wave activity is strongest, this may keep hyperactive regions from disturbing other brain areas and from interrupting sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would explain why people with tinnitus can still enter deep sleep, and why tinnitus may be suppressed during that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is also important for strengthening our memory, by helping to drive &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11343661/"&gt;changes in connections&lt;/a&gt; between neurons in the brain. We believe that changes in brain connectivity during sleep are contributing to what makes tinnitus last for a long time after an initial trigger (such as hearing loss).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Treating tinnitus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We already know that intensity of tinnitus can change throughout a given day. Investigating how tinnitus changes during sleep could give us a direct handle on what the brain does to cause fluctuations in tinnitus intensity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also means that we may be able to manipulate sleep to improve the wellbeing of patients – and possibly develop new treatments for tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, sleep disruptions can be reduced and slow-wave activity can be boosted through &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33984745/"&gt;sleep restriction paradigms&lt;/a&gt;, where patients are told to only go to bed when they're actually tired. Boosting the intensity of sleep could help us better see the effect sleep has on tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we suspect that deep sleep is the most likely to affect tinnitus, there are many other stages of sleep that happen (such as rapid eye movement, or REM sleep) – each with unique patterns of brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In future research, both the sleep stage and tinnitus activity in the brain could be tracked at the same time by recording brain activity. This may help to find out more about the link between tinnitus and sleep and understand how tinnitus may be alleviated by natural brain activity. &lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/182711/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" loading="lazy"&gt;

By recording electrical activity directly from the brains of five patients during a visual task, scientists discovered that specific thalamic regions activate earlier and more strongly during moments of visual awareness. These findings suggest that the intralaminar and medial thalamic nuclei act as a gateway that initiates conscious perception by influencing the activity of the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thalamus is a small, egg-shaped structure located deep in the center of the brain. It acts as a hub for relaying sensory information—like sight, sound, and touch—to the cerebral cortex, where perception and interpretation occur. In addition to this relay role, it also helps regulate alertness, sleep, and attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the thalamus has long been understood as a relay station for sensory information, it has been largely viewed as a supporting actor—important for maintaining wakefulness, but not the actual source of conscious experience. The current study challenges this idea, offering new evidence that the thalamus does more than just relay signals. It may actively shape what enters our conscious awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this, the research team took advantage of a unique opportunity to record deep brain activity in humans. Five adult men undergoing treatment for severe, drug-resistant headaches had stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) electrodes implanted in their brains. These electrodes allowed researchers to monitor neural activity in real-time across multiple brain regions, including various parts of the thalamus and the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed a visual awareness task that presented images at the edge of conscious visibility. On each trial, a patterned stimulus briefly appeared to one side of a central fixation point. Some images were bright and clearly visible, while others were faint and difficult to detect. Occasionally, no stimulus was shown at all. After each trial, participants responded with an eye movement indicating whether they had seen the stimulus and where it had appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This setup allowed the researchers to compare brain activity between trials where participants consciously saw the stimulus and trials where they did not, even though the visual input was nearly identical. This critical contrast helped isolate the neural processes specifically linked to awareness, rather than simple sensory input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that certain regions deep within the thalamus—specifically the central medial nucleus, mediodorsal medial nucleus, and parafascicular nucleus—showed increased activity during trials when participants reported seeing the stimulus. These regions are known as the intralaminar and medial thalamic nuclei. Their responses occurred earlier and with greater intensity than activity in other thalamic regions, such as the ventral nuclei, and even earlier than responses in the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a range of analyses, the researchers found that these high-order thalamic nuclei exhibited stronger electrical signals, increased low-frequency oscillations, and more synchronized activity during moments of awareness. Importantly, the timing of this activity—beginning around 200 milliseconds after stimulus presentation—aligned with the earliest known brain signatures of conscious perception, such as the visual awareness negativity signal recorded in prior scalp-based studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how these signals travel through the brain, the researchers examined how different brain regions communicated during conscious versus unconscious trials. They measured the synchronization of neural oscillations, particularly in the theta frequency range (about 4–8 Hz), which has been linked to cognitive control and awareness. They also analyzed cross-frequency coupling, which describes how slow brain rhythms may coordinate faster activity in other areas. Both measures revealed that the intralaminar and medial thalamic regions drove neural coordination with the prefrontal cortex during conscious perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, when participants were aware of the stimulus, the thalamus was not simply reacting to sensory input—it was actively shaping the brain’s response, sending signals to the prefrontal cortex and helping to organize brain-wide activity in support of awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional analyses showed that the neural patterns in the thalamus and prefrontal cortex encoded information about whether participants were consciously aware of the stimulus, rather than simply reflecting aspects of the task like contrast strength, motor response, or reaction time. This strengthens the case that these regions are directly involved in conscious perception, rather than just downstream reflections of other cognitive processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the researchers also found that the activity in the thalamus, particularly in the intralaminar and medial nuclei, could begin even before the stimulus appeared. This pre-stimulus activity was more synchronized in trials where participants would later report being aware of the stimulus, suggesting that these regions may help set the stage for conscious perception by influencing the brain’s state of readiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is the first to offer such detailed recordings from multiple thalamic nuclei in humans during a task designed to probe the boundary between conscious and unconscious visual perception. Prior studies using imaging methods like functional MRI or magnetoencephalography hinted at thalamic involvement in awareness but lacked the precision to pinpoint when and where this activity occurred. The use of sEEG here provided a rare opportunity to capture the dynamics of deep brain structures with both high temporal and spatial resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings provide strong support for the idea that consciousness is not solely a cortical phenomenon. Instead, the thalamus—especially its high-order nuclei—appears to play an active and early role in making sensory information available to our awareness. This may reflect the thalamus’s unique position as a hub, with widespread connections to both cortical and subcortical brain regions, allowing it to coordinate complex patterns of neural activity required for consciousness to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the authors note some limitations. The study was conducted in a small sample of five male patients, all of whom had electrodes implanted for clinical reasons related to headache treatment. Although their cognitive abilities and vision were intact, these participants do not represent the general population. Moreover, electrode placement was determined by medical need, not research goals, which means some brain regions may have been under-sampled or missed entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, while the study strongly suggests that intralaminar and medial thalamic nuclei initiate the conscious perception process, it does not rule out important contributions from the cortex. The prefrontal cortex, particularly the lateral regions, still showed significant activity and participated in synchronized neural networks during awareness. The researchers suggest that the thalamus may act as a gate or initiator, while the cortex elaborates on the content of experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adr3675" target="_blank"&gt;Human high-order thalamic nuclei gate conscious perception through the thalamofrontal loop&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Zepeng Fang, Yuanyuan Dang, An’an Ping, Chenyu Wang, Qianchuan Zhao, Hulin Zhao, Xiaoli Li, and Mingsha Zhang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 22:07:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQa3plSlhwazlCa3Y1Mm8xbElfS0Q0ay1McXh6U2Y1UEZsWERmdFl6SXZCMTgxaVByTVhfaUVWelhyQUpiSzNmTHRBeFBmNk1Pank3RTdXZm9YTTVzakZUUHJXb3pkaEMyLUVySVdpOHNsV196Q28zVTctSU1vTUVGaThxNDk2LWZuTlJjTHhuWkg</guid></item><item><title>电惊厥疗法冠军Max Fink去世，享年102岁-《纽约时报》 | Max Fink, Champion of Electroconvulsive Therapy, Dies at 102 - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE5sRHgzaW4tSFpaU1VrbEpiWkRlR252NHBUYnVJRldyZHkyNWtZQlFmN2ljdEV1MzF0SHQyT3lzeTMySGpsRlFLY1E5NmNrMlFtbUJ5UnNPVUlzcVZ0bFgwZHhxTEhXN3lEdzNhOUNR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 21:57:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE5sRHgzaW4tSFpaU1VrbEpiWkRlR252NHBUYnVJRldyZHkyNWtZQlFmN2ljdEV1MzF0SHQyT3lzeTMySGpsRlFLY1E5NmNrMlFtbUJ5UnNPVUlzcVZ0bFgwZHhxTEhXN3lEdzNhOUNR</guid></item><item><title>科学家刚刚将这些食物与认知衰退风险降低80 ％联系起来- EatingWell | Scientists Just Connected These Foods with an 80% Lower Risk of Cognitive Decline - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxQLU1pdUFqdTVpdzcwcFpOdXFPOUExVkN1VmdzTzVzZ3gxNlN2elFhakUzMXFkVnludVhlVGJ2Q3o3US0wUmg3NmUtb0thMDgwYkVuWkJnNWpId1NXUTJYQjlybTNmblY5d3p6U3R3ZGVCVWlSX2NFX2lRcEI1VzFTVg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests eating more antioxidant-rich foods may lower cognitive decline risk by 80%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Participants who ate the most foods rich in vitamins, magnesium, zinc and selenium had the best outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nuts, leafy greens, berries, whole grains and more plant-based foods are great sources of antioxidants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you misplace your keys for the third time in a week or blank on a close friend’s name, it’s hard not to wonder: Is this normal aging—or something more? Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition marked by subtle but noticeable changes in memory and thinking. And it’s surprisingly common among older adults. It affects nearly one third of people over age 65, and for many, it’s an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/number-one-habit-to-reduce-dementia-risk-8722637" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;early warning sign of dementia&lt;/a&gt;, including Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unlike normal age-related forgetfulness, mild cognitive impairment can make it harder to manage daily tasks and can progress into more serious cognitive decline. While there’s still no cure for Alzheimer’s or other dementias, researchers are zeroing in on strategies to help delay or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-to-avoid-for-cognitive-health-8786846" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prevent cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;. Diet is one of the most promising—and controllable—factors.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many studies have suggested that antioxidant-rich foods may protect the brain, but questions remain: How much do they help? And what about other common habits, like drinking alcohol—does it cancel out any benefits? To explore these questions, researchers looked at the relationship between &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-as-many-antioxidants-as-green-tea-11761365" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dietary antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;, alcohol consumption, and the risk of mild cognitive impairment in older adults. They recently published their findings in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;—and the results may inspire you to rethink what’s on your plate and in your glass.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Let’s break down what they discovered.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This was a cross-sectional study, meaning it looked at data from a single point in time rather than following participants over a period of years. Researchers gathered data from 1,084 adults aged 55 and older living in Zhejiang Province, China. Participants answered questions about their diet, lifestyle, alcohol consumption and health history. They completed a cognitive screening using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a widely used tool for detecting mild cognitive impairment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers used a validated dietary questionnaire to calculate a Composite Dietary Antioxidant Index (CDAI) for each person. The CDAI is based on six key antioxidants: vitamins A, C and E, as well as magnesium, zinc and selenium. Participants were sorted into four groups based on their CDAI scores, from lowest to highest.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study found a clear pattern: people with higher antioxidant index scores had lower odds of having mild cognitive impairment—up to an 80% reduced risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But these risk reduction benefits aren’t for everybody across the board. When researchers looked at how alcohol and antioxidants interacted, they found that the protective effects of antioxidants were only statistically significant among people who didn’t drink alcohol at all. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In other words, drinking any alcohol seemed to cancel out some of the brain benefits of a high-antioxidant diet. And  people who drank alcohol one to two times a week had more than double the odds of having mild cognitive impairment compared to non-drinkers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Keep in mind, because this was a cross-sectional study, it can only show associations—not cause and effect. The dietary data was also self-reported, and people aren’t always 100% inaccurate when remembering what they ate. And while the study accounted for many factors that might influence brain health (like age, education and depression), it didn’t account for the amount or type of alcohol consumed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These findings support what many nutrition experts have been saying for years: antioxidants help protect the brain and alcohol—despite the hype around red wine—may do more harm than good when it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/drinks-per-week-increase-dementia-risk-11715884" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cognitive health&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leafy greens&lt;/strong&gt; (spinach, kale) for magnesium and vitamin E&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Berries and citrus fruits&lt;/strong&gt; for vitamin C&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carrots, sweet potatoes, and winter squash&lt;/strong&gt; for vitamin A&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead of reaching for a glass of wine in hopes of getting antioxidants, reach for a fruit salad or a handful of nuts. Foods provide a broader mix of beneficial nutrients—and without the potential downsides of alcohol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even small dietary upgrades can help. Try tossing sunflower seeds on your salad, snacking on oranges or blending spinach into a smoothie. If you're already eating some antioxidant-rich foods, think about how you can include even more variety.

Using functional MRI, researchers observed how volunteers responded to demanding memory tasks and how their willingness to continue changed based on internal fatigue and external rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more mentally drained participants felt, the more activity these brain regions showed—yet higher financial incentives still pushed them to keep going. These insights could help guide treatments for fatigue-related conditions like depression and PTSD by offering a measurable, biological view of mental effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fatigue Circuits Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; The right insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex show heightened activity during cognitive fatigue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effort vs. Incentive:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher monetary rewards increased participants’ willingness to exert mental effort, even when fatigued.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may inform treatments for mental exhaustion in PTSD, depression, and related conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Johns Hopkins Medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In experiments with healthy volunteers undergoing functional MRI imaging, scientists have found increased activity in two areas of the brain that work together to react to, and possibly regulate, the brain when it’s “feeling” tired and either quits or continues exerting mental effort. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiments, designed to help detect various aspects of brain fatigue, may provide a way for physicians to better evaluate and treat people who experience overwhelming mental exhaustion, including those with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the scientists say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111241"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience.jpg" alt="This shows two people and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/mental-fatigue-neurosience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The tests of their working memory, which took place while undergoing subsequent MRI scans of their brains, included looking at a series of letters, in sequence, on a screen and recalling the position of certain letters. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A report on the NIH-funded study was published online June 11 in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, detailing results on 18 female and 10 male healthy adult volunteers given tasks to exercise their memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our lab focuses on how [our minds] generate value for effort,” says Vikram Chib, Ph.D., associate professor of biomedical engineering at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and a research scientist at Kennedy Krieger Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We understand less about the biology of cognitive tasks, including memory and recall, than we do about physical tasks, even though both involve a lot of effort.” Anecdotally, Chib says, scientists know cognitive tasks are tiring, and relatively less about why and how such fatigue develops and plays out in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 28 study participants, who ranged in age from 21 to 29, were paid $50 to participate in the study, and were told they could receive additional payments based on their performance and choices. All participants received a baseline MRI scan before the experiments began. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tests of their working memory, which took place while undergoing subsequent MRI scans of their brains, included looking at a series of letters, in sequence, on a screen and recalling the position of certain letters. The farther back a letter was in the series of letters, the harder it was to recall its position, increasing the cognitive effort expended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were given feedback on their performance after each test and opportunities to receive increasing payments ($1–$8) with more difficult recall exercises. The participants also were asked before and after each test to self-rate their level of cognitive fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the test results found increased activity and connectivity in two brain areas when participants reported cognitive fatigue: the right insula, an area deep in the brain that has been associated with feelings of fatigue, and the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, areas on both sides of the brain that control working memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each participant, activity in both brain locations during cognitive fatigue increased by more than twice the level of baseline measurements taken before starting the tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study was designed to induce cognitive fatigue and see how people’s choices to exert effort change when they feel fatigue, as well as identify locations in the brain where these decisions are made,” says Chib. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, Chib and his research team members Grace Steward and Vivian Looi found that the financial incentives need to be high in order for participants to exert increased cognitive effort, suggesting that external incentives prompt such effort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That outcome wasn’t entirely surprising, given our previous work finding the same need for incentives in spurring physical effort,” says Chib. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The two areas of the brain may be working together to decide to avoid more cognitive effort unless there are more incentives offered. However, there may be a discrepancy between perceptions in cognitive fatigue and what the human brain is actually capable of doing,” says Chib. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatigue is linked with many neurological conditions, including PTSD and depression, says Chib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now that we’ve likely identified some of the neural circuits for cognitive effort in healthy people, we need to look at how fatigue manifests in the brains of people with these conditions,” he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chib says it may be possible to use medication or cognitive behavior therapy to combat cognitive fatigue, and the current study using decision tasks and functional MRI could be a framework for objectively classifying cognitive fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functional MRI uses blood flow to measure broad areas of activity in the brain; however, it does not directly measure neuron activation, nor more subtle nuances in brain activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study was performed in an MRI scanner and with very specific cognitive tasks. It will be important to see how these results generalize to other cognitive effort and real-world tasks,” says Chib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Funding for the research was provided by the National Institutes of Health (R01HD097619, R01MH119086).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5d2a3c2e293c1d3735303473383928" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Vanessa Wasta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://jhmi.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Johns Hopkins University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Vanessa Wasta – Johns Hopkins University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1612-24.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Neurobiology of Cognitive Fatigue and Its Influence on Effort-Based Choice&lt;/a&gt;” by Vikram Chib et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Neurobiology of Cognitive Fatigue and Its Influence on Effort-Based Choice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feelings of cognitive fatigue emerge through repeated mental exertion and are ubiquitous in our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is a limited understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the influence of cognitive fatigue on decisions to exert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants (18 females, 10 males) chose to exert effort for reward, before and after bouts of fatiguing cognitive exertion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that when participants became cognitively fatigued, they were more likely to choose to forgo higher levels of reward for more effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We describe a mechanism by which signals related to cognitive exertion in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex influence effort value computations, instantiated by the insula, thereby influencing an individual’s decisions to exert while fatigued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that cognitive fatigue plays a critical role in decisions to exert effort and provides a mechanistic link through which information about cognitive state shapes effort-based choice.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 20:20:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE55SGNoSVhndFREN0dXMHNoXzVnZDBwMHRUQjBscm1kTmZtYlF6NWdUXzgwandoc2FOMm9RSjk2QllNVHI0NEZZNkQyejF4Wi05Y3p6VmNoV1hON21tMm1QbUZZOUdYNHVXY3BhSUNxT1BmWGxG</guid></item><item><title>新研究将间歇性禁食与通过大脑多巴胺系统改善情绪联系起来- PsyPost | New study links intermittent fasting to improved mood via brain’s dopamine system - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQWWJUSDZfMG9RajA0SUE0MzVpeE5RdXdtRVdsaURBSWJ5TzJzWGh5QmpQVEVHMENoeHhCZlpsOVNhMkxDeTVqRDNkTnctRDBrcDAwdnVtWkZfLWFUNjA0WXlieWdtbXB5cUszcUstZmF0T1k2bFBFOHkyclg2U1N5cGtTNS1jMFhDOUhlWUFzMHBrWnkyMV9OMXNMdUxsd1lKZlpZRG1pVTM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intermittent fasting may help alleviate depression symptoms by targeting dopamine receptors in the brain, according to a new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbd.2025.106931" target="_blank"&gt;Neurobiology of Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression is one of the most common mental health disorders. Traditional antidepressants can take weeks to take effect and often come with undesirable side effects. Researchers have been exploring alternative strategies to improve mental health, and one promising avenue is nutrition. Intermittent fasting — a dietary pattern that involves alternating periods of eating and fasting — has gained increasing attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have suggested that fasting may influence the brain’s neurotransmitter systems, but the precise mechanisms have remained unclear. In this new research, scientists investigated whether intermittent fasting could reduce depression-like symptoms by acting on dopamine D1 receptors, which are known to play a key role in mood regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their hypothesis, a research team led by Jingjing Piao from the Second Hospital of Jilin University in China used a well-established mouse model of depression known as Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress (CUMS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice were exposed to a series of randomly arranged stressors over several weeks — such as foot shocks, water deprivation, and tail pinching — to mimic the effects of chronic stress in humans. After this period, some of the mice were placed on an intermittent fasting schedule that alternated 24-hour periods of food availability with 24-hour fasting. For comparison, other groups of mice received the common antidepressant fluoxetine or underwent a shorter 9-hour fasting period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. Mice in the intermittent fasting group showed marked improvements in depression-related behaviors. They were more likely to engage in pleasurable activities, such as drinking a sugar solution — a sign of reduced anhedonia, or loss of pleasure. These mice also exhibited decreased immobility in behavioral tests designed to assess despair-like symptoms, suggesting greater resilience to stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how intermittent fasting produced these effects, the researchers examined the mice’s brain activity. They found increased neuronal activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a brain region involved in emotional regulation. More specifically, intermittent fasting enhanced activity in the Drd1-cAMP-PKA-DARPP-32-CREB-BDNF signaling pathway — a cascade of molecular events associated with dopamine D1 receptor function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When researchers administered a drug that blocked dopamine D1 receptors, the antidepressant-like effects of intermittent fasting disappeared. This indicated that the benefits were directly dependent on this dopamine pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further experiments using optogenetics — a technique that uses light to control the activity of specific neurons — reinforced this conclusion. When the researchers artificially activated dopamine D1 receptor-expressing neurons in the mPFC, the mice exhibited behavioral improvements similar to those seen with fasting. Conversely, inhibiting these neurons reversed the effects of fasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings offer promising insights into the biological mechanisms linking intermittent fasting and depression, the researchers acknowledge key limitations. The study was conducted in mice, and more research is needed to determine whether similar effects occur in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbd.2025.106931" target="_blank"&gt;Intermittent fasting produces antidepressant-like effects by modulating dopamine D1 receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Jingjing Piao, Hongyu Chen, Xinmiao Piao, Ziqian Cheng, Fangyi Zhao, Ranji Cui, and Bingjin Li.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 20:08:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQWWJUSDZfMG9RajA0SUE0MzVpeE5RdXdtRVdsaURBSWJ5TzJzWGh5QmpQVEVHMENoeHhCZlpsOVNhMkxDeTVqRDNkTnctRDBrcDAwdnVtWkZfLWFUNjA0WXlieWdtbXB5cUszcUstZmF0T1k2bFBFOHkyclg2U1N5cGtTNS1jMFhDOUhlWUFzMHBrWnkyMV9OMXNMdUxsd1lKZlpZRG1pVTM</guid></item><item><title>肯塔基州新报告的4例麻疹病例- WKYT | 4 new measles cases reported in Kentucky - WKYT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE5zV3JkazhLYk0zRFZ5VGtvUGlvZ2t1Q2lFX3BDbTNzc29YR3JWQW1yWG1rdno0UzFqZUNPMENDWFdkeHM1WGJManhoaC1nMndMNmJIT1FVSmMxYnNTS3g1RTl3T00yZk9zb2NnQ2ppNE5QSWg4XzVrOUtR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;KENTUCKY (WKYT) - Officials with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services announced four new measles cases were reported in the state this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Three cases are part of the same household in Woodford County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The fourth case, involving someone known to have been exposed to measles while traveling internationally, is in Todd County and unrelated to the other three cases, according to health officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="media-item | figure media-item-image article-image w-100"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Health officials are working to identify others who may have been exposed to those infected while they were contagious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;None of the four were vaccinated against measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;These new cases bring the total number of measles cases reported in Kentucky this year to six. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Kentucky’s &lt;a href="https://www.wkyt.com/2025/02/27/health-officials-announce-confirmed-measles-case-kentucky/" rel=""&gt;first confirmed measles case of 2025&lt;/a&gt; occurred in an adult Franklin County resident in February.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may already know that heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S.—back in 2022, around one in five deaths in the U.S. was due to heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Unfortunately, experts are projecting that by 2035, 45% of American adults will be living with heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news is that dying from heart disease is highly preventable, and scientists are continually looking for ways to prevent it. Besides lifestyle habits, like a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7872995/complete-list-of-heart-healthy-foods/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart-healthy diet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/exercise-may-reduce-heart-disease-by-lowering-stress-response-8635621" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;regular physical activity&lt;/a&gt;, managing stressors and getting plenty of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-habit-for-longevity-11758701" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;quality sleep&lt;/a&gt;, there are specific nutrients that may be particularly helpful. Vitamin D is one of them, as evidence suggests that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7950001/signs-you-might-have-a-vitamin-d-deficiency/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;low blood levels of vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; may increase the risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Our bodies &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/does-sunscreen-block-vitamin-d-8638665" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;manufacture vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; when we’re exposed to sunlight. But enough of the body needs to be exposed—arms, legs and face—for long enough, which poses some potential problems for people trying to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-reduce-skin-cancer-risk-11736017" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;prevent skin cancer&lt;/a&gt; or who easily burn. It’s also difficult for those who live in colder winter climates to get enough skin exposure year-round. For this reason, vitamin D is one of the vitamins that may need to be supplemented.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers did a narrative review of studies on vitamin D and heart disease. They reported their findings in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers searched databases for studies on vitamin D and cardiovascular disease and reported the studies’ findings. As they narrowed down the field of studies, the researchers considered studies that used &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-vitamin-d-supplements-8656101" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D supplementation&lt;/a&gt; or assessed participants’ level of vitamin D with bloodwork.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since this was a narrative review, they didn’t analyze the data; they simply reported the findings. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers found that while the mechanisms by which vitamin D reduces heart disease risk are well understood, clinical evidence of these benefits remains scant, due to a lack of well-designed studies. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With that said, here are some of the major findings researchers picked up in their review.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;In pregnant women, vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of preeclampsia by 60%, gestational diabetes by 50% and preterm delivery by 40%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with prediabetes may be able to significantly reduce their risk of heart disease by supplementing with vitamin D.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In people taking statins (to help lower cholesterol) or cardiovascular medications, supplementing with vitamin D may lower the risk of major cardiovascular events by 13% to 17%. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Limitations of any narrative review include difficulty finding high-quality studies and bias in interpreting the results. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We know that vitamin D is essential for many bodily processes, including healthy bones and immune and nerve function. There is also evidence that vitamin D may play a role in preventing depression. Regarding heart disease, more and more evidence is stacking up in vitamin D’s favor. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vitamin-d-heart-disease-study-11735001" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;we recently reported&lt;/a&gt; on a study that suggests that vitamin D deficiency may increase your risk of heart disease by 10%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D is a vitamin that people are commonly deficient in. And researchers do not always agree on who and how much people should supplement. The only way to know if you’re deficient in vitamin D is to be tested, but some professional organizations, like the Endocrine Society, state that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/2024-vitamin-d-recommendations-8659678" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;routine screening for vitamin D deficiency is unnecessary&lt;/a&gt;, and that most people do not need to supplement. So, how do you know?

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some things to consider include where you live, how often you get outside with skin exposed and how many &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-vitamin-d-than-an-egg-8732396" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;foods rich in vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; you eat. Foods that contain vitamin D include egg yolks, mushrooms, fatty fish (salmon, tuna, herring, swordfish, sardines), beef liver, cod liver oil and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8025336/vitamin-d-added-to-your-favorite-cereal-heres-why/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fortified foods&lt;/a&gt;, like milk, orange juice and cereal.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Generally, adults over 70, children and teens require more vitamin D. And &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/conditions-when-you-need-vitamin-d-supplement-8576496" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;if you’re pregnant or have osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll need to increase your intake, too. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regardless of where you’re at in the life cycle, if you know you’re not regularly eating vitamin D foods or getting outside often and long enough with enough skin exposure, it’s probably feasible to request a blood test from a medical professional. If the test suggests you’re deficient, talk to them or seek the advice of a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-supplement-8645052" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;registered dietitian regarding supplementation&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Seeking professional advice is important because vitamin D is a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053927/these-supplements-can-be-toxic-if-you-take-too-much/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fat-soluble vitamin&lt;/a&gt;. If you take too much over time, it can build up in your body and ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-much-vitamin-d-per-day-is-too-much-8605769" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;can even become lethal&lt;/a&gt;. So, having a health professional work with you find the dose that’s right for you can be helpful.

Two years later, he underwent surgery to remove the tumor and says he has been cancer-free ever since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But doctors remain fiercely skeptical, warning that even the strictest vegan diet cannot replace chemotherapy or immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Fremont claims that the plant-based diet and healthy lifestyle cured his colorectal metastases. The cancer had spread to his lymph nodes, and doctors gave the now-103-year-old three months to live&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While a healthy diet plays a supportive role in cancer care, doctors argue it must be combined with medical treatments. Nutrition alone cannot eliminate cancer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer experts previously told the Daily Mail they are seeing &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14806089/ananda-lewis-breast-cancer-rise-alternative-medicine.html"&gt;a 'concerning' rise&lt;/a&gt; of patients using controversial treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2023 study found 70 percent of cancer patients use alternative medicine, one in three of that share use it as their sole method of treatment and 27 percent hid it from their oncologists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Heber &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/diet-for-your-diagnosis-nutrition-plays-prime-role-in-treating-cancer"&gt;added&lt;/a&gt;: 'A nutritious diet should be used along with proper treatments in cancer patients, but diet alone absolutely cannot cure cancer.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 75 percent of colorectal cancer patients will be alive five years after their diagnosis with treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without treatment, survival rates drop to just 44 percent after three years, making medical intervention absolutely crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A former Yale University wrestler, Fremont had been an avid runner since the 70s when he was grieving the death of his wife. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His first of more than a dozen marathons was the 1972 Boston Marathon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At 103, the retired engineer and climate activist still holds multiple world records as the fastest marathoner in the 88, 90, and 91-year-old age categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That's why it was so shocking when Fremont got the world-upending news in 1991.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.greatveganathletes.com/mike-fremont-vegan-runner/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: ‘I contracted a cancer which the Cleveland Clinic said would kill me in 3 months unless operated upon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;At 103, the retired engineer and climate activist still holds multiple world records as the fastest marathoner in the 88, 90, and 91-year-old age categories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I said no, I was going on a diet!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The tumor had metastasized into my lymphatic system and would have required efforts to treat the metastases with radiation and/or chemotherapy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two years later he underwent an operation to remove the tumor from his colon when it began to bleed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the procedure, doctors checked for cancer spread in 35 places around Fremont’s body, he said, and found zero signs of cancer spread to other parts of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fremont believes that his stellar health and advanced age are primarily due to his habits, rather than genetics. His father died of liver cancer, and his mother of a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: ‘The results of the diet have been perfect and it has been since that diet that all my world records have come about as well as such distinction in the US.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And he doesn’t plan on slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My route is 5 miles long, through a scenic park near Cincinnati with mixed surface, lots of hills,’ he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The first mile is at my maximum speed, the other four under pressure to run fast. I resolved at age 98 to run 5 miles rather than 10, but to do it at speed.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fremont has always followed a disciplined fitness plan, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/world/heres-how-this-103-year-old-runner-defeated-cancer-arthritis-without-medicines-19627886.htm"&gt;saying he runs&lt;/a&gt; five miles three times a week and incorporating push-ups and pull-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A typical day of eating for Fremont begins with oatmeal, syrup, and blueberries for breakfast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lunch consists of beans, while dinner includes broccoli florets topped with ketchup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Data from JAMA Surgery showed colon cancer is expected to rise by 90 percent in people ages 20 to 34 by 2030&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fremont also lives a low-stress lifestyle, using exercise as a form of emotional release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also does not drink or smoke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His healthy lifestyle has been shown to prevent cancer and its recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has shown that a structured exercise program for stage II and III colon cancer patients reduced recurrence by 28 percent, lowered mortality risk by 37 percent over eight years, and showed benefits with just 1.5 to 2.25 hours of brisk walking weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Focusing on whole, unprocessed plant foods increases the amount of beneficial nutrients and compounds taken in that help reduce inflammation, a key factor in cancer development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, these dietary choices can support healthy weight, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar control, all of which contribute to a lower cancer risk &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But there is no concrete evidence diet alone can reverse cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Is Greta Thunberg the literal antichrist? Are the three predominant ideological schools in Europe environmentalism, "Islamic Shariah law" and "Chinese Communist totalitarian takeover"? Is AI "woke" and capable of following Elon Musk to Mars? Peter seems to think so! Perhaps the "just asking questions" school of journalism could add "&lt;em&gt;hey, what the fuck are you talking about&lt;/em&gt;" to its repertoire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, many of these assertions fall squarely into the realm of things that exist within Thiel's mind palace rather than verifiable facts, with at least one notable exception. Relatively early in their chat, Peter tells Ross the following [emphasis ours]:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we look at biotech, something like dementia, Alzheimer’s — &lt;strong&gt;we’ve made zero progress in 40 to 50 years&lt;/strong&gt;. People are completely stuck on beta amyloids. It’s obviously not working. It’s just some kind of a stupid racket where the people are just reinforcing themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a pretty bold claim! It's also completely untrue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was no treatment 40 or 50 years ago for Alzheimer's disease," Sterling Johnson, a professor of Geriatrics and Gerontology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, told Engadget. "What we've been able to do in the last 20 years has been actually pretty extraordinary. We've developed markers that help us identify when this disease starts, using the using amyloid markers and tau biomarkers, we know that the disease actually begins 20 years before the symptoms do, and that is a critical thing to know if we are going to prevent this disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, Alzheimer's remains incurable. But the absence of a miracle cure does not negate the accomplishments thus far in detection and prevention. "The first treatments were these window dressing treatments. It's like treating the symptoms like you would treat a cold [...] The first generation of amyloid therapy was that kind of approach where it just addressed the symptoms by amping up the neurons and increasing the neurotransmitters available to the to the brain cells." Johnson, whose team runs one of the largest and longest &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://wrap.wisc.edu/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; on people at risk for developing Alzheimer's disease, added, "Now we have opportunities to actually modify the disease biology through the amyloid pathway, but also we're focused on the other proteinopathy — which is &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tauopathy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tau;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;tau&lt;/a&gt; — and there's clinical trials underway."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thiel, a well-known advocate for advancements in radical life extension (including a &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/peter-thiel-wants-to-inject-himself-with-young-peoples-blood?srsltid=AfmBOorWPpJna-9f4HpVxwkhBkh_6IbM-7PPlpHzAhmc5HoK02GTRv4s" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reported;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; interest in injecting himself with the blood of young people) sees the state of scientific research in this area as sluggish and risk averse. But the groundbreaking work is happening at this moment. Professor Johnson pointed to a monoclonal antibody called &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/roche-alzheimer-drug-could-prevent-onset/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gantenerumab;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;gantenerumab&lt;/a&gt;. In an early test of 73 participants with inherited mutations that would cause them to overproduce amyloid in the brain, it cut the number of participants who developed Alzheimer's symptoms practically in half. "The big phase-three prevention trials are happening right now." Those are using lecanemab and donanemab, two other monoclonal treatments, which Johnson clarified are "already known to be better than gantenerumab at clearing out beta-amyloid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For someone who fashions himself as a heterodox thinker, Thiel certainly seems to have stumbled on a remarkably similar talking point to current Trump administration FDA head Robert F Kennedy Jr. "Alzheimer's is a very, very good example of how [National Institute of Health] has gone off the rails over the past 20 years ago with research on amyloid plaques" Kennedy &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/DzkPRscLkpQ?si=PS-Qgx5bZFIrVGxG&amp;amp;t=1319" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at a Department of Health budgetary hearing last month.

Participants who took the supplement daily for two months showed significant improvements in several domains of memory and spatial reasoning compared to those who took a placebo. The supplement was also well-tolerated, with no significant side effects reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment, or MCI, refers to a decline in memory or thinking skills that is noticeable but does not yet interfere significantly with daily life. People with MCI are at a higher risk of developing dementia later in life, including Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are no approved medications specifically for treating MCI, and many people turn to lifestyle interventions such as exercise, diet changes, and cognitive training to slow cognitive decline. Herbal supplements have also gained attention, with ashwagandha — a plant long used in traditional Indian medicine — often recommended for stress, anxiety, and cognitive support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ashwagandha, also known by its botanical name &lt;em&gt;Withania somnifera&lt;/em&gt;, has a long history of use in Ayurveda, the traditional medical system of India. Recent research has suggested that its compounds may have neuroprotective properties. In particular, Sominone — a metabolite derived from one of the plant’s active constituents — has shown promise in animal studies. It has been found to support the growth of nerve cells, protect neurons from damage, and enhance memory performance. The current study was designed to test whether a standardized extract of ashwagandha containing Sominone (called Somin-On™) could produce similar effects in humans diagnosed with MCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study at a medical center in Jhansi, India. A total of 40 adults with MCI were selected to participate after meeting specific inclusion criteria. Participants were between the ages of 25 and 65 and had mild memory problems as measured by common clinical tests. They were randomly assigned to receive either 250 mg of Somin-On™ or a placebo capsule once daily for 60 days. Both participants and researchers were unaware of who received the treatment and who received the placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive function was measured using several standardized tools: the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Wechsler Memory Scale-III (WMS-III), and the Shepard Mental Rotation Task. These assessments were administered at the beginning of the study, halfway through, and again at the end. The researchers focused on changes in immediate memory, general memory, working memory, attention, and visuospatial processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. Compared to those taking a placebo, participants in the Somin-On™ group showed consistent and statistically significant improvements across nearly all domains tested. Improvements were already evident after 30 days of treatment and became more pronounced by the end of the 60-day study period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the Shepard Mental Rotation Task, which assesses spatial reasoning and mental imagery, showed a 12% increase in performance at 30 days and a 32% increase at 60 days among those taking Somin-On™, while the placebo group showed a decline by the end of the study. Similar trends were seen in the Wechsler Memory Scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In measures of immediate memory, participants taking the supplement improved by about 7% at 60 days, while those in the placebo group actually declined slightly. General memory scores rose nearly 15% in the treatment group, compared to only a small increase in the placebo group. Working memory improved by over 18% in those taking Somin-On™, with negligible change in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two widely used screening tools, MoCA and MMSE, also showed marked improvement. MoCA scores in the treatment group rose nearly 15% from baseline, and MMSE scores increased by more than 19%. Both improvements were significantly higher than those observed in the placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The supplement was also well-tolerated. No participants in either group reported any adverse side effects, and standard blood tests and liver and kidney function markers remained stable throughout the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that the cognitive benefits of Somin-On™ may stem from its neuroprotective mechanisms. Previous animal research has shown that Sominone, the main active ingredient, can enhance the growth of neural connections and reverse memory deficits caused by damage to brain cells. It has also been shown to improve spatial memory and reduce brain cell shrinkage in models of Alzheimer’s disease, without necessarily affecting other markers like amyloid plaques. These findings hint at a potential mode of action involving the growth and maintenance of neural networks, rather than targeting traditional hallmarks of neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other possible mechanisms include increased resistance to oxidative stress, improvements in mitochondrial function, and support for cholinergic signaling — all of which have been linked to memory function in the brain. Inflammation and excitotoxicity, two processes involved in neurodegeneration, have also been shown to be reduced by components of ashwagandha in previous studies. Although the current study did not examine these mechanisms directly, the cognitive improvements observed may reflect the result of one or more of these biological pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these encouraging findings, the study has several limitations. First, the sample size was small, with only 40 participants. Larger studies are needed to confirm the results and better understand how widely they apply. Second, the duration of the study was limited to two months. It is unclear whether the benefits of Somin-On™ persist over a longer period or whether the supplement could help prevent further decline. Third, the study did not use imaging techniques or biological markers to assess brain changes, so the underlying processes behind the cognitive improvements remain speculative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is the absence of an active comparator group. The study compared Somin-On™ to a placebo, but did not compare it to other forms of ashwagandha or to other cognitive-enhancing treatments. Since ashwagandha contains multiple bioactive compounds, future studies could investigate whether Sominone alone is responsible for the observed benefits or if the effects arise from a broader mix of constituents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that future trials should include a more diverse participant pool, longer follow-up, and potentially integrate imaging or biomarker data to explore how ashwagandha affects brain structure and function. It would also be valuable to test the supplement in combination with other non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as cognitive training or physical exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/02698811251324377" target="_blank"&gt;Effect of ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) extract with Sominone (Somin-On™) to improve memory in adults with mild cognitive impairment: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Hari Prakash Rai and Deo Nidhi Mishra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 18:04:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxOQW9pQ0NQYTFrOEQtQnFiTEtPVnRRS09MVWVuXzlmb1pEM282Q1hCUUJtaXNBSHFzZG5FTGFRWjQwN3RTV2dkVU1SakJ6VU54U19OT2hKQ24wc1hBOEZJZmlUU2ZoQVN0Z2c2NnBXalpyUTU1eHpQWjdoYUV2N2dvVEF4aVI4WlZfeXdFc3ppTmQ0MGRqOUdGT1Y5cDJsZUJhSHhCZ0hVVTdReGZ5cHNnenVaWlFVbjNaemo5eUtiNkEtbHM</guid></item><item><title>什么是硫柳汞？研究对RFK Jr.抨击下的疫苗防腐剂的评价- PBS | What is thimerosal?

&lt;p&gt;During the first meeting of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s recently downsized vaccine panel, the group voted to stop recommending flu vaccines containing thimerosal, a vaccine preservative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a lengthy &lt;a href="https://archive.fo/ZbCAV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;June 24 X post&lt;/a&gt; that preceded the meeting, Kennedy, who spent two decades as an antivaccine movement leader, described thimerosal using terms such as “toxic” and said hundreds of studies identify it as a carcinogenic “potent neurotoxin.” He also said there are high doses of mercury in flu shots recommended to pregnant women and children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/faca/committees/acip.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&lt;/a&gt;’ two-day meeting on June 25 and 26 included &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/20/cdc-vaccine-panel-rfk-jr#:~:text=A%20key%20vaccine%20advisory%20panel,anti%2Dvaccine%20activists%20for%20decades" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;discussion of vaccines&lt;/a&gt; containing thimerosal before its vote on flu vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ACIP is an independent group that &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/jun/12/ACIP-vaccine-committee-RFK-removes-edited-video/"&gt;provides vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt; the CDC director reviews and decides whether to formally adopt. Earlier in June, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/jun/12/ACIP-vaccine-committee-RFK-removes-edited-video/"&gt;dismissed&lt;/a&gt; 17 ACIP members, replacing them with seven new members, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/06/11/rfk-cdc-vaccine-committee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; people who’ve &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/24/us/politics/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-panel.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;expressed doubt about vaccine efficacy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2022/jan/06/who-robert-malone-joe-rogans-guest-was-vaccine-sci/"&gt;promoted antivaccine falsehoods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors and scientists who study vaccines have been researching thimerosal’s use for decades. Here’s what to know about the vaccine preservative and its removal from flu vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is thimerosal?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thimerosal is a mercury-based preservative used in some vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people — particularly those who are pregnant or breastfeeding — encounter &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/pregnancy-and-fish/art-20044185" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;warnings&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/consumers/advice-about-eating-fish" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; consuming mercury, such as in seafood. But those warnings are about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/faqs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;methylmercury&lt;/a&gt;, which is found in certain kinds of fish and is known to be toxic to people when consumed at high levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thimerosal contains ethylmercury — a single-letter difference that might not sound significant, but is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human bodies can break down and excrete ethylmercury quickly, meaning it is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/faqs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;less likely&lt;/a&gt; to cause harm. By contrast, methylmercury is more likely to &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/thimerosal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;accumulate&lt;/a&gt; in the body and cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In vaccines, thimerosal is added to &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/thimerosal-and-vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;prevent harmful microbes&lt;/a&gt; such as bacteria and fungi from &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250626135423/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/faqs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;growing in vaccine vials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Introduction of bacteria and fungi has the potential to occur when a syringe needle enters a vial as a vaccine is being prepared for administration,” the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250626135423/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/faqs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;CDC’s website&lt;/a&gt; said. “Contamination by germs in a vaccine could cause severe local reactions, serious illness or death. In some vaccines, preservatives, including thimerosal, are added during the manufacturing process to prevent germ growth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thimerosal has been at the heart of Kennedy’s antivaccine activism for 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/fact-checking-rfk-jr-s-claim-that-environmental-toxins-cause-autism"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Fact-checking RFK Jr.’s claim that environmental toxins cause autism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005, Kennedy wrote an article co-published by Rolling Stone and Salon that alleged leading health agencies including the CDC and U.S. Food and Drug Administration had colluded with vaccine manufacturers to conceal a study that found thimerosal “may have caused autism in thousands of kids.” Scientists and researchers &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2023/dec/21/robert-f-kennedy-jrs-campaign-of-conspiracy-theori/"&gt;said Kennedy’s argument&lt;/a&gt; was inaccurate and misleading. Continued research has found no link between thimerosal and autism. Kennedy’s article &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rolling-stone-retracts-autism-article-but-lots-of-junk-journalism-remains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;was removed from Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2011/01/16/dangerous_immunity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Salon retracted&lt;/a&gt; it in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Kennedy wrote a book opposing thimerosal’s use in vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Which vaccines use thimerosal?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thimerosal is not used in the vast majority of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All vaccines the CDC &lt;a href="https://aap2.silverchair-cdn.com/aap2/content_public/cms/resources/15585/0-18yrs-child-combined-schedule.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;routinely recommends&lt;/a&gt; for children age 6 or younger are &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/thimerosal-and-vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;available without thimerosal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children receiving the routine &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-age.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;pediatric vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt; “can get completely immunized without any thimerosal-containing vaccines,” said Dr. Mark Sawyer, a pediatrics professor at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine and a pediatric infectious disease physician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some childhood vaccines &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250626135423/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/faqs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;have never contained&lt;/a&gt; thimerosal. These include the measles, mumps, rubella or MMR vaccine, the varicella or chickenpox vaccine, the inactivated polio vaccine and the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thimerosal was &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/thimerosal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; from most vaccines — including all childhood vaccines — as of 2001, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/faqs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thimerosal is still used in vaccines today, but not as widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preservative is in only a small fraction of influenza vaccine vials, specifically the multi-dose vials that constitute a small portion of the U.S. flu shot supply, Dr. Jake Scott told PolitiFact. Scott is a Stanford University School of Medicine infectious disease specialist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA said &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250626135735/https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/thimerosal-and-vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;thimerosal use has declined&lt;/a&gt; as vaccine manufacturers have developed more single-dose vaccines that do not require preservatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott said the CDC lists 12 influenza vaccine formulations for the 2024 to 2025 flu season, which will also cover the 2025 to 2026 season because no new flu vaccines have been licensed. Of those 12 vaccines, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/thimerosal-and-vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;just three&lt;/a&gt; are multi-dose vaccines that contain thimerosal at 25 micrograms — equal to 25 millionths of a gram — per dose, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC’s supply data shows single-dose, thimerosal-free syringes &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/what-to-know-about-thimerosal-vaccine-preservative-from-bygone-flu-shot-debate#:~:text=Why%20is%20thimerosal%20controversial?,and%20replaces%20expert%20former%20members" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;make up&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.pharmacytimes.com/view/acip-recommends-adults-receive-seasonal-single-dose-influenza-vaccines-free-of-thimerosal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;about 96%&lt;/a&gt; of the U.S. flu vaccine supply, leaving roughly 4% as multi-dose vials, Scott said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Single-dose syringes are the default for pediatrics and prenatal care, so real-world exposure is even lower,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because flu vaccines with thimerosal constitute a small portion of the influenza vaccine supply, public health experts told &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/06/26/rfk-jr-acip-thimerosal-flu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; the committee’s vote to stop recommending them would have a limited impact, although it could make flu shots more expensive and less accessible in some parts of the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does research show about thimerosal?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because antivaccine activists’ focus has centered on whether thimerosal causes autism, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/197365" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;numerous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24814559/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;scientific&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14595043/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/126/4/656/65633/Prenatal-and-Infant-Exposure-to-Thimerosal-From?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; investigated a potential link and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24814559/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/10997/chapter/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;no causal relationship&lt;/a&gt; between the preservative and autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When scientists evaluated thimerosal’s potential impacts and risks they found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vaccine researchers told PolitiFact that thimerosal was removed from vaccines out of an abundance of caution, not because research proved that thimerosal was unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thimerosal was removed from vaccines because people thought it might cause problems, said Rachel Roper, a microbiology and immunology professor at East Carolina University. But ultimately, “studies were done and it was shown to be safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no evidence to-date that thimerosal “causes any harm whatsoever,” Sawyer said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bilious blowout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors noted that his breath was fast and shallow, with crackling in his neck. But breathing sounds from the base of his right lung were quiet. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed the problems. There was air in his chest space and into his neck. Fluid was also building up around his lungs, and his right lung was collapsing. The scan also showed a perforation in the esophagus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctors inserted a chest tube to remove the fluid, which did not include gastric contents, suggesting the fluid build-up was from chest inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctors then did an additional X-ray exam of the esophagus using a water-soluble contrast agent. This clearly revealed a large gash in the man's esophagus resulting from the robust eruption. The imaging also showed the contrast agent leaking out into the man's chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctors quickly sent the man into emergency surgery to repair his esophagus. He spent the next 35 days in the hospital recovering. When he was discharged, he still had a feeding tube that passed through his nose and into his small intestine. It took an additional three months for the perforation to completely heal, at which point doctors could finally remove the feeding tube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not entirely clear what causes Boerhaave syndrome. Researchers hypothesize that it occurs from a loss of neuromuscular coordination, which, in particular, causes the upper sphincter in the esophagus—the cricopharyngeus—to fail to relax at the onset of vomiting. The rapid rise of internal pressure overwhelms the esophagus, typically causing a lengthwise tear in the lower third of the tube, which is the weakest portion. On average, tears can be up to 8 centimeters (about 3 inches) long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though researchers expect that cases are underreported, the estimated incidence based on reports is about three cases per million people globally each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cortisol helps regulate stress, sleep and metabolism—but chronic elevation can harm long-term health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Signs of high cortisol include poor sleep, visceral fat gain and feeling mentally alert but physically tired.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Managing stress, sleep, blood sugar and gut health can help reduce cortisol and chronic inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’ve spent any time on social media lately, you’ve probably seen &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-when-you-wake-up-for-healthy-cortisol-levels-8784363" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cortisol&lt;/a&gt; blamed for everything from visceral fat to burnout and sleepless nights. While it’s true that this stress hormone plays a role in how you feel, cortisol is essential for many everyday functions. “It helps regulate your body’s stress response, blood sugar, metabolism, inflammation and even your sleep-wake cycle,” says &lt;a href="https://rootfunctionalmedicine.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Erica Armstrong, M.D., IFMCP&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The key is to keep cortisol in a healthy range, which healthy adrenal glands manage all on their own. If cortisol levels become too high for too long, you may start to notice some unpleasant side effects, and your health could be at risk. To untangle fact from fiction when it comes to cortisol, we spoke with physicians to understand what this stress hormone does, how to spot when it might be out of balance and steps you can take to manage inflammation and feel your best. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-is-cortisol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Is Cortisol? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Cortisol is a hormone produced by your adrenal glands that plays an essential role in your health,” says Armstrong. This hormone naturally follows a 24-hour cycle, peaking 30 minutes after waking up, and declining during the day, with the lowest levels occurring during the early phases of sleep.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a stress hormone, cortisol is regulated by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA axis) and surges during times of high stress. A burst of cortisol leads to high amounts of sugar released into the bloodstream for extra energy, vasoconstriction and increased heart rate to get your body ready for the “fight or flight” response.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;This response is useful in a situation when you need to move or act quickly, but can create problems when it occurs too frequently, and without the follow-up of physical action. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most cells in the body have cortisol receptors, meaning that this stress hormone impacts everything from your heart to your brain, metabolism, immune system and more. Chronically high cortisol levels are a biomarker for a number of diseases, including heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and other metabolic and inflammatory conditions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Some of the most common causes for elevated cortisol include chronic stress, insulin resistance, autoimmune diseases and Cushing’s syndrome, explains Armstrong. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-signs-your-cortisol-may-be-high"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Signs Your Cortisol May Be High &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The only way to know if you have high cortisol levels is to see a medical professional.  “We always combine symptoms with lab testing (like a 4-point saliva cortisol test) and a full clinical picture before concluding whether cortisol is truly out of balance,” says Armstrong. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, these are some of the most common signs of high cortisol: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; You have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have trouble falling asleep at night or tend to wake up in the middle of the night and can’t fall back asleep, it could have something to do with your stress hormones. “Cortisol should be low at night, but if it's spiking due to stress or blood sugar dips, it can wake you up in the middle of the night,” says Armstrong. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One study of healthy individuals found that higher pre-sleep cortisol levels were associated with shorter and poorer sleep quality than lower pre-sleep cortisol levels.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;A similar connection was also found among people with type 2 diabetes. Left unaddressed, poor sleep quality and short duration can lead to a number of health concerns, including an increased risk of heart disease and all-cause mortality.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; You start gaining weight around your abdomen &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you find yourself holding on to extra weight around your midsection, despite no changes in your diet or exercise routines, it could be a sign of high cortisol levels. In one study of middle-aged and older adults, those with higher levels of hair cortisol were more likely to have a higher body weight and waist circumference than those with lower levels.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;  “Cortisol promotes fat storage, especially around the midsection, as a survival mechanism,” says Armstrong. While the chances of elevated cortisol are higher in those with abdominal obesity, many people who may fall on the obesity scale do not have elevated cortisol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; You feel “tired but wired”  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a stress hormone, cortisol helps your brain stay ready for impending danger, which can feel downright exhausting when you’re stuck in that state for too long. “Elevated cortisol can make you feel mentally alert even when you’re physically exhausted,” says Armstrong. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, even if you’re feeling mentally wired, chances are your brain isn’t operating at its best. High levels of cortisol, maintained over long periods, are associated with reduced cognitive function and impaired sleep, which can further impair mental functions such as memory and attention.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-tips-for-managing-inflammation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Tips for Managing Inflammation &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Working to lower elevated cortisol levels can help reduce chronic inflammation and the risk of inflammatory diseases. Here are other expert-approved ways to manage inflammation: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow an anti-inflammatory diet:&lt;/strong&gt; An anti-inflammatory diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids, plenty of colorful fruits and vegetables and fiber-rich legumes can help support your body’s natural ability to regulate inflammation and stress. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work to balance your blood sugar levels&lt;/strong&gt;: “Stabilizing blood sugar through regular meals with protein, fat and fiber can calm both inflammation and cortisol spikes,” says Armstrong. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on stress management&lt;/strong&gt;: Managing your mental, emotional and physical stress with adequate rest and prioritizing mental health and self-care activities can help reduce stress and inflammation. Research supports the use of mindfulness, meditation and relaxation interventions as effective ways to manage and lower cortisol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize sleep&lt;/strong&gt;: “Even one night of poor sleep can elevate inflammatory markers,” says Armstrong. As inconsistent sleep is highly associated with inflammation, creating and sticking to a consistent sleep schedule and routine should be a top priority in your inflammation management plan.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take care of your gut health&lt;/strong&gt;: The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in regulating your immune system and controlling inflammation. “Addressing microbiome imbalances, food sensitivities, or underlying infections through personalized protocols can dramatically reduce systemic inflammation,” says Armstrong. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;When operating correctly, your body has systems in place to regulate cortisol production and release for an appropriate stress response. So while most people do not have to worry about elevated cortisol, chronically high levels can cause unwanted side effects and increase the risk of inflammatory and metabolic health conditions. Difficulty sleeping, abdominal weight gain and feeling mentally wired but physically tired can indicate elevated cortisol levels; however, these symptoms could also be caused by a variety of other health conditions or imbalances. The best way to know for sure is to speak with a healthcare provider.

Embryologists can spend hours manually scanning a semen sample in hopes of spotting a viable sperm cell.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Insulin resistance is when your cells begin to lose their ability to use insulin efficiently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Forty percent of young and middle-aged U.S. adults have this condition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many supplements sold to improve insulin resistance may make it worse or be dangerous.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Four out of 10 U.S. adults ages 18 to 44 have insulin resistance—and most don’t even know it.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But what is insulin resistance, anyway? This condition is when your cells begin to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-have-insulin-resistance-8400321" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;develop a tolerance to insulin&lt;/a&gt;, the hormone needed to push glucose into your cells for energy. When insulin doesn’t work as well as it used to, your pancreas responds by trying to make more of it.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For a while, your body can compensate for this additional need until the pancreas struggles to produce the insulin required to keep cells energized. However, if it continues for long enough, it can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/risk-factors-prediabetes-8733895" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lead to prediabetes and eventually type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. What’s more, if you have type 2 diabetes, you already have insulin resistance. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While it’s not clear exactly why insulin resistance happens, genetics and age are believed to play a role.

Recommended strategies may also include &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7893676/how-to-lose-weight-when-you-dont-know-where-to-start-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;weight loss to reach a healthy body weight&lt;/a&gt;, which helps your body use its insulin effectively.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-st-johns-wort"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. St. John’s Wort &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; St. John’s wort is a shrub that’s used as a supplement to treat depression and symptoms of menopause.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, it may pose problems for people with insulin resistance. Although no medications are approved to specifically treat insulin resistance, you may be on medications like metformin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones if you have diabetes. However, combining St. John’s wort with these drugs can be a problem. “It can decrease the efficacy of these medications and lead to higher blood sugar levels,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-katz-rd-cdces-9889b863/?trk=public_profile_browsemap" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lizzy Katz, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, diabetes program coordinator at the University of Maryland Capital Region Medical Center.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At the same time, diabetes and depression often overlap, says the American Diabetes Association.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, if you’re struggling with your mental health, talk to your health care practitioner about safe treatment for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-gymnema"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Gymnema &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Gymnema is a plant that has been studied for the treatment of diabetes. “However, there is insufficient reliable evidence of this—and even a risk for hypoglycemia,” says Katz. In fact, most of the research on this supplement has been conducted in animals, and even those studies conclude it shouldn’t be recommended for preventing diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The National Institutes of Health agrees, adding that the current research on gymnema is lacking, and combined with other supplements, it may be especially dangerous.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Also, if you are taking insulin secretagogues, such as sulfonylureas, you should avoid gymnema due to potential interactions, Katz advises.   
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-bcaas"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. BCAAs &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; BCAAs is short for branched-chain amino acids. These &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-protein-and-its-benefits-11732679" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein building blocks&lt;/a&gt; are naturally found in foods. They are also sold in unnaturally large quantities as supplements advertised for muscle-building and improving results at the gym.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For that reason, many people take them before a workout. This supplement is one that people with insulin resistance should avoid, cautions &lt;a href="https://kimberlygomer.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kimberly Gomer, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “There have been some links to BCAAs worsening insulin resistance,” she says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Yes, exercise is important for treating insulin resistance. But you can reap its benefits without popping a supplement. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-omega-3-fats"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Omega-3 Fats &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-as-many-omega-3s-as-salmon-11681920" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Omega-3 fats, like DHA and EPA&lt;/a&gt;, are mainly found in fatty fish, such as salmon and sardines. But they’re also a popular supplement. If you have insulin resistance, this is one to talk to your provider about before adding it to your routine. “It’s been shown as likely ineffective for managing diabetes, and [there’s] not enough evidence for treatment of diabetic nephropathy,” says Katz. (Diabetic nephropathy is a kidney disease that can result as a complication of diabetes.) Plus, the research on omega-3s and insulin resistance is mixed. While some studies have found omega-3s may help lower fasting blood glucose and protect against insulin resistance, other research suggests they may raise blood sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you are on certain antidiabetes medications like insulin secretagogues, there may also be a risk of low blood sugar, adds Katz.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-cinnamon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Cinnamon &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-cinnamon-interacts-with-your-meds-11711435" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cinnamon is heavily marketed for diabetes control&lt;/a&gt; and insulin resistance. One review of 16 studies even showed that cinnamon supplementation helped lower fasting blood sugar and insulin resistance in people with diabetes, says Katz.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But before you get too excited, she points out that the studies used in this analysis are severely limited, as they differed in dosage, length of treatment and type of participant. That means we need larger trials and a standardized formula to determine the exact type of cinnamon supplement and protocol that’s actually effective. Until then, skip the cinnamon supplements. But feel free to go ahead and sprinkle some cinnamon onto your food.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-strategies-to-improve-insulin-resistance-without-supplements"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Strategies to Improve Insulin Resistance Without Supplements &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For the most part, you don’t need supplements if you have insulin resistance. Your health care provider might recommend supplements in certain situations, such as an iron supplement if blood tests reveal you have anemia, says Gomer. But when it comes to insulin resistance specifically, experts recommend focusing on these healthy lifestyle habits instead.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/proteins-to-eat-every-week-11684415" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Prioritize Protein&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;“Protein will help keep you full,” says Gomer. So, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/longform/7821676/protein-nation/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;filling up on protein&lt;/a&gt; may also help you avoid overeating. That can help you maintain a healthy body weight, which is one of the best things you can do to manage blood sugar and reduce insulin resistance. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pile on the Veggies: &lt;/strong&gt;Make sure that your plate is also filled with nonstarchy vegetables. They’re naturally low in carbs, plus their ample fiber slows down carbohydrate absorption and promotes satiety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Active: &lt;/strong&gt;“&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7915267/best-time-of-day-to-exercise/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Regular exercise is a great component&lt;/a&gt; to focus on because it can improve insulin resistance in the short and long term,” says Katz. That’s because exercise prompts muscles to use up blood sugar as fuel, reducing glucose levels. It can also help cells become more insulin sensitive. Aim for a total of 150 minutes of physical activity per week. You can break that down however you like, whether it’s five 30-minute walks or 15 10-minute movement breaks throughout the week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim for a Healthy Body Weight: &lt;/strong&gt;According to the American Diabetes Association, even modest weight loss can help reduce insulin resistance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you have insulin resistance or simply want to prevent this condition from sneaking up on you, consider connecting with a registered dietitian, especially one who specializes in diabetes care. They can help you develop a weight-loss plan that’s best suited for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you’ve been told you have insulin resistance or are worried about developing it, you may be considering a supplement. However, health experts caution against self-treating with supplements, especially St. John’s wort, gymnema, BCAAs, omega-3 fats and cinnamon. While you may have heard these can help manage insulin resistance, they may be useless or, in some cases, even dangerous. Instead, think lifestyle changes like exercise, a protein- and fiber-rich eating plan and weight loss, if indicated. These all have a solid, proven track record for improving insulin resistance. However, if you’re still concerned, speak with your health care practitioner. They can help you determine if you’re at risk or refer you to a registered dietitian for one-on-one nutrition counseling for better blood sugar.&lt;br&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;BAYFIELD COUNTY — A person in northern Wisconsin has died after contracting a tick-borne virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bayfield County Health Department said the patient died from the Powassan virus in early June. &lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;The patient who died was one of three people who have contracted the virus so far this year in Wisconsin, and all three were hospitalized, the state's Department of Health Services said in a June 24 bulletin issued to health care providers and health departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus is spread by the blacklegged tick, commonly referred to as a deer tick, and symptoms can include fever, headache, vomiting and generalized weakness, DHS said. &lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;The agency said it can also progress to encephalitis — with symptoms like altered mental states, seizures, speech and movement problems, and paralysis — or meningitis — with symptoms like severe headaches, sensitivity to light and neck rigidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 1 out of 10 people with a severe case die, and half of those with a severe case are left with long-term health problems like memory loss and recurring headaches, according to the 
    
      &lt;a class="Link " href="https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/symptoms-diagnosis-treatment/index.html" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt;
    
      &lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;The DHS said risk factors for neurologic disease from the Powassan virus include those with compromised immune systems, as well as children and older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing privacy laws, DHS declined to share the age of the patient who died in Bayfield County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no treatment or vaccine for the virus. The DHS urged people to use tick repellent, check for and remove ticks before they can bite and avoid wooded and bushy areas where the virus is found.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;Cases of Powassan 
    
      &lt;a class="Link " href="https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/sports/northland-outdoors/tick-borne-powassan-virus-creeps-into-minnesota" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;are on the rise&lt;/a&gt;
    
       in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Minnesota reported 14 cases in 2024 and Wisconsin reported 12 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why the number of cases is up is unclear, but there are more deer — the blacklegged tick's preferred host — and more people living near wooded areas with ticks, the News Tribune reported in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DHS said ticks become infected with Powassan when they bite and consume the blood of an infected skunk, groundhog, squirrel, mouse, or other rodent. However, the exact source of the virus remains unknown. Ticks can also be born with Powassan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease was first identified in Wisconsin in 2003. From 2003 to 2024, 67 cases were detected in the state, primarily in the northern region,

The advice makes sense — maybe it really is that tempting screen that’s keeping you up — and yet many people say they can’t fall asleep without scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re one of those people, you’re in luck. According to &lt;a href="https://sleepcycle.com/science-of-sleep/a-sleep-cycle-series" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="T3D"&gt;Dr. Michael Gradisar&lt;/a&gt;, the head of sleep science at &lt;a href="https://sleepcycle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="T3D"&gt;Sleep Cycle&lt;/a&gt;, you shouldn’t feel the need to force yourself to turn off your devices and lie in bed in abject silence. In fact, your phone might even help you drift off to dreamland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some experts say blue light from screens &lt;a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/how-does-cell-phone-blue-light-mess-with-your-sleep-a-new-study-shows-how-your-eye-cells-respond-to-it-13226431" class="T3D"&gt;disrupts your sleep by suppressing melatonin&lt;/a&gt;, Gradisar says this advice is actually &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25535358/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="T3D"&gt;based on a study&lt;/a&gt; that exposed participants to abnormally intense levels of it. “Over time, it became simplified into a broad recommendation,” he tells Bustle. “It’s one of the most persistent myths in sleep science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, he published &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079224000376" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="T3D"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Sleep Medicine Reviews &lt;/em&gt;showing that blue light from everyday devices simply isn’t bright enough to affect your sleep in a meaningful way. “For context, the screens we use at night typically &lt;a href="https://sleepreviewmag.com/sleep-health/parameters/quality/blue-light-devices-not-sleep-stealer-we-thought/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="T3D"&gt;emit light under 80 lux&lt;/a&gt;, while significant circadian shifts usually require exposure to light intensities around 500 lux or more,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, &lt;a href="https://www.bustle.com/wellness/how-to-sleep-through-the-night-sleep-consultation" class="T3D"&gt;getting a good night’s rest&lt;/a&gt; is less about ditching your devices and more about how you use them in the hours before you snooze. Here’s what to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Phones In Bed? Seriously?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to scroll, play a podcast, or even watch TV before bed, don’t hold back. For many people, enjoying some pre-sleep screen time might even be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using a phone or having background noise from the TV helps quiet the mind, especially if your thoughts tend to spiral when the room goes silent,” Gradisar says. “In sleep science, we often see that the real barrier to falling asleep isn’t the screen or the light, but racing thoughts, worry, or stress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relaxing with your phone goes a long way. “That distraction can actually reduce cognitive arousal, which is a key factor in insomnia,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While scrolling can quickly become a coping tool, and one that does make it easier to fall asleep, Gradisar recommends investigating the root cause of your sleep issues, whether it’s stress-related or a circadian rhythm issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sWr iGR CEt"&gt;&lt;figure class="Qf5 E1M"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figcaption class="rv9 TrI"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Manu Vega/Moment/Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re lying awake each night and blaming your phone, it might be time to look deeper,” he says. “Phones may be part of your bedtime routine, but they’re rarely the core problem. Instead, it’s often your thoughts, your stress levels, or your internal clock that need attention.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with other researchers, Gradisar conducted &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079224000376" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="T3D"&gt;a comprehensive review&lt;/a&gt; of nearly a dozen experimental studies about whether blue light from screens meaningfully affected sleep. They found that screens aren’t the sleep villain they’re made out to be. What’s really impacting your rest is staying up too late. “It’s a behavioral issue,” he says. “Not a biological one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tips For Lulling Yourself To Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="sWr iGR CEt"&gt;&lt;figure class="Qf5 E1M"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figcaption class="rv9 TrI"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Olga Pankova/Moment/Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all screen time is equal. “Don’t scroll endlessly, stress over emails, or chase one more episode deep into the night,” he says. Instead, browse a soothing subreddit, organize a Pinterest board, or play a simple game, and limit yourself to just one device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can prop up your phone, even better. The less you tap your screen, he says, the more likely you are to relax into sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Try not to start anything too stimulating close to bedtime, and ideally, aim to protect your sleep window,” he says. “At the end of the day, it’s not about eliminating screens. It’s about being intentional with them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Studies referenced:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bauducco, S., Pillion, M., Bartel, K., Reynolds, C., Kahn, M., &amp;amp; Gradisar, M.

Supplements work, yet many communities lack steady access, and cost is sometimes a prohibitive factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pseudo-b12-from-spirulina-microalgae"&gt;Pseudo-B12 from Spirulina microalgae&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular Spirulina mainly carries pseudo‑B12, a look‑alike molecule that our cells ignore. The Iceland project used tuned LED lighting to flip the alga’s own genes toward making methylcobalamin, the active form that humans can absorb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboratory assays put the new strain’s B12 at 1.64 micrograms per 100 grams of dry powder, which is comfortably above the 0.7‑1.5 µg/100 g window quoted for beef in the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 98 percent of that total was active B12, not pseudo, ending a long‑standing barrier for microalgae‑based nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers call the product “Photosynthetically Controlled Spirulina,” or &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33566210/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PCS&lt;/a&gt;. They achieved the upgrade without genetic modification, relying instead on light spectra that boost a native metabolic pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-creating-spirulina-with-b-12-vitamins"&gt;Creating Spirulina with B-12 vitamins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those pathways ran inside flat‑panel photobioreactor walls that were kept at about 88 °F (31 °C), aerated by &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032119305398" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;GEOTHERMAL carbon‑dioxide&lt;/a&gt; and powered by Iceland’s near‑total renewable electric grid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The closed system blocks contamination and uses minimal freshwater, an important edge over open ponds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PCS stayed carbon neutral because every kilowatt came from hydro or geothermal turbines, and harvested biomass trapped the same amount of carbon that the process emitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides B12, PCS in Spirulina microalgae delivers roughly 27 grams of protein and 0.03 grams of iron per 100 grams, a profile that tracks or beats lean steak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/page-files/Vitamin%20B-12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;USDA tables&lt;/a&gt; show beef cuts can swing from 0.8 to about 4 micrograms of B12 per 100 grams, depending on the muscle and cooking method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With vitamin B12 levels at 1.64 micrograms per 100 grams of dry powder, Spirulina is also a comparable source of this essential vitamin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, it is light in fat, contains no cholesterol, and is naturally salt free, making it easier to incorporate into heart-friendly diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings demonstrate that photosynthetically controlled Spirulina can produce desirable levels of active vitamin B12, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional animal‑source foods,” confirmed Dr. Tzachor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beef production averages about 60 kilograms (132 pounds) of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sharks-may-benefit-from-rising-temperatures-but-not-from-rising-co2/"&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‑equivalent emissions for every kilogram of meat, the highest of any staple protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because PCS cultivation is powered by renewables, swapping a kilogram of steak for an equal mass of algae could erase more than 60 kilograms (130 pounds) of greenhouse gas from the menu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper sketches a country‑wide scale‑up: diverting electricity that is now used by heavy industry could let Iceland ship 278 thousand tons of PCS a year, enough active B12 to meet the daily needs of nearly 14 million toddlers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even a smaller rollout could plug critical gaps in areas where deficiency and childhood stunting overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PCS ships as a shelf‑stable powder that blends into flour, beverages, or nutrition bars, trimming cold‑chain costs that hinder meat or milk aid. Because it is an autotroph, it sidesteps the feed, land, and water burdens that shadow livestock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-b12-rich-spirulina-and-food-policy"&gt;B12-rich Spirulina and food policy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;PCS could also shift how governments approach &lt;strong&gt;f&lt;/strong&gt;ood security and &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/malnutrition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;malnutrition&lt;/a&gt;. Because the production system is modular and closed-loop, it can be deployed in regions with poor soil, unreliable rainfall, or limited farmland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That opens the door to building local microalgae facilities in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, where &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/which-dietary-changes-are-best-for-cancer-prevention/"&gt;vitamin B12&lt;/a&gt; deficiency is most severe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If validated at scale, PCS could also influence agricultural subsidies and international food aid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nations might begin to classify Spirulina as a strategic crop, eligible for public investment or included in procurement plans for schools, hospitals, and humanitarian agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would mark a rare crossover between biotech innovation and public nutrition policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical teams still have to confirm how well humans absorb the algae‑bound &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/vitamin-b-paradox-supplement-linked-to-heart-disease-risk/"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; compared with pills or steak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trials are being designed to track blood markers, nerve function, and taste acceptance across a two‑year window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineers also need to soften PCS’s distinctive color and aroma for picky eaters, especially children. Early tests suggest microencapsulation or partial extraction can hide the hue without stripping the nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44187-024-00152-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discover Food&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Anal cancer is on the rise, with specialist Dr. Evan Goldstein sharing a little-known warning sign that can increase the risk, which he dubs a 'silent disease'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While nine out of 10 HPV infections go away on their own,&lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/anal-cancer#:~:text=Anal%20Cancer%20Causes&amp;amp;text=HPV%20is%20the%20most%20common,cause%20genital%20and%20anal%20warts."&gt; Johns Hopkins notes&lt;/a&gt; if the infection becomes persistent or more severe due to a weakened immune system, HPV can cause cancers later in life, including anal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk of developing anal cancer is around one in 500, according to the &lt;a target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/anal-cancer.html"&gt;American Cancer Society.&lt;/a&gt; The site noted that this number was particularly high among white and Hispanic women over the age of 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anal cancer symptoms can be similar to those of hemorrhoids and anal fissures, sometimes making it harder to diagnose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The main symptoms are bleeding from the anus, itching and pain, as well small lumps around and inside your bottom and a discharge of mucus and inconsistent stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The idea is to catch this early with early detection anal pap smears and full anoscopy with an appropriate anal practitioner,' Dr. Goldstein explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The more we talk about anal health and standardize yearly evaluations, similar to genecology appointments, the better all of us will be,' he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Goldstein often shares information about anal health, revealing a critical mistake people are making after using the toilet, explaining it could lead to serious health issues over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The leading proctologist says 'traditional wiping' with toilet paper is causing unnecessary damage and is even more concerned about the popularity of using wet wipes to complete the job. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Goldstein described anal warts as 'painful and itchy' and said they can 'lead to bleeding' (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking to &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://shows.acast.com/am-i-doing-it-wrong"&gt;HuffPost for Am I Doing It Wrong?&lt;/a&gt; Dr Goldstein explained that the skin around the anus is sensitive, and wiping with toilet paper can easily lead to irritation, small tears, and long-term damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's a problem that he sees far too often in his clinic, and it's only getting worse as more people rely on wet wipes for a 'cleaner' finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They are so terrible - not only for the environment, but for your hole,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's so many companies out there throwing wipes and I think they should all be banned.

			&lt;p&gt;The earlier &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt; is spotted, the better – for patients, their loved ones, and scientists working toward treatments or a cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study has found that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in earwax could carry chemical signals of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/men-have-higher-risk-of-parkinsons-and-we-may-finally-know-why"&gt;the neurological disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work builds on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-woman-can-smell-parkinson-s-and-could-be-the-key-to-an-early-detection-test"&gt;earlier findings&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="165705" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; subtly alters body odor, through changes in sebum, the oily substance that naturally moisturizes our hair and skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with trying to analyze sebum on the skin is that its exposure to air and the external environment makes it less reliable for clinical testing. Scientists led by a team from Zhejiang University wanted to take a look at &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/why-you-should-never-clean-the-wax-in-your-ears"&gt;ear wax&lt;/a&gt; – which is better protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/caffeine-flips-a-cellular-switch-that-may-slow-aging-scientists-discover?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffeine Flips a Cellular Switch That May Slow Aging, Scientists Discover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for Parkinson's disease treatment," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.5c00908"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper. "This study proposes a diagnostic model… that analyzes VOCs from ear canal secretions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15583/jpchrom.2019.014"&gt;Scientists think&lt;/a&gt; those VOCs can be altered by inflammation, cell stress, and neurodegeneration in the brain&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15583/jpchrom.2019.014"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. With the right tests, the team hypothesized that subtle signals for Parkinson's could show up in the ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers took ear canal swabs from 209 study participants, 108 of whom had been given a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-discovery-means-parkinsons-could-be-diagnosed-with-a-swab-in-just-3-minutes"&gt;Parkinson's disease diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;. By charting differences in earwax composition between people with and without Parkinson's, four VOCs stood out: ethylbenzene, 4-ethyltoluene, pentanal, and 2-pentadecyl-1,3-dioxolane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_165708" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165708" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/EarAnalysis.jpg" alt="Study Shows It May Be Possible to Screen For Parkinson's Through Your Ear Wax" class="wp-image-165708 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/EarAnalysis.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/EarAnalysis-634x415.jpg 634w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/EarAnalysis-600x393.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-165708" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers &lt;span&gt;identified&lt;/span&gt; specific compounds inside ear wax.

First, though, this same analysis needs to be run on larger groups of people over longer periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then also trained an AI dataset using the same VOC data, producing a tool called an  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/artificial-intelligence" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73092" data-postid="165705" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; olfactory system (AIO) that achieved a 94.4 percent accuracy rate in identifying people from the study &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-may-be-caused-by-a-common-aquatic-bacterium"&gt;with Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; – a promising start, but only on a small sample of people so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The AIO based analytical system underscores its potential for use in bedside medical diagnostic devices, aiding in earlier and more effective treatment for Parkinson's disease patients," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.5c00908"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current methods of diagnosing Parkinson's can involve a combination of clinical assessments and brain scans. The new research could potentially lead to a simple ear swab test that could make this diagnostic screening process quicker, cheaper, and capable of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-test-detects-parkinsons-7-years-before-most-symptoms-show"&gt;picking up Parkinson's earlier&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings could also help ongoing study to understand how Parkinson's gets started and how it might be stopped. Identified VOC changes could possibly be used as a chemical fingerprint, identifying &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-voice-could-hide-the-tell-tale-signs-of-parkinsons-disease"&gt;other changes happening&lt;/a&gt; because of – or perhaps leading to – the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The next step is to conduct further research at different stages of the disease, in multiple research centers and among multiple ethnic groups, &lt;a href="https://www.acs.org/pressroom/presspacs/2025/june/ear-wax-as-a-possible-screening-medium-for-parkinsons-disease.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;in order to determine whether this method has greater practical application value," &lt;a href="https://www.acs.org/pressroom/presspacs/2025/june/ear-wax-as-a-possible-screening-medium-for-parkinsons-disease.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biochemist Hao Dong, from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.5c00908"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analytical Chemistry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Imagine getting rid of your persistent fat layers, while gaining girth down under. That's a contemporary equivalent to the fabled fountain of youth, and a special class of weight loss drugs that leverage the GLP-1 hormone - such as Novo Nordisk's Wegovy or Eli Lilly's &lt;a href="https://wccftech.com/eli-lilly-and-company-glp-1-weight-loss-drug-is-much-more-effective-than-novo-nordisk/"&gt;Zepbound&lt;/a&gt; - are now being billed as the conduits for these seemingly miraculous benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the benefit of those who might not be aware, the GLP-1 hormone suppresses hunger and regulates the production of insulin and glucose. After a meal, this hormone raises the level of insulin, which decreases blood glucose levels. Simultaneously, it reduces the rate at which the stomach empties its contents into the small intestine, creating a feeling of fullness and satiation in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk's diabetes-geared Ozempic and obesity-focused Wegovy mimic this process by using the GLP-1 agonist semaglutide, which binds to the GLP-1 hormone receptor, triggering the hormone in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.diabetes.co.uk/news/2024/jun/average-penis-size-in-the-uk-has-risen-due-to-ozempic-data-suggests.html"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Diabetes.co.uk, the average penile length in the United Kingdom has increased by 0.46 inches between 2022 and 2024, increasing from 5.17 inches to 5.63 inches over the period. Incidentally, this timeframe also coincides with the launch of Ozempic/Wegovy in the UK and the drug's subsequent rip-roaring popularity, with many A-class celebrities, including Oprah Winfrey and Elon Musk, jumping onto the proverbial bandwagon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reported increase in penile length is also corroborated by several social media anecdotes &lt;a href="https://www.uniladtech.com/science/news/doctor-explains-ozempic-penis-phenomenon-side-effect-004987-20250623"&gt;gathered&lt;/a&gt; by Unilad Tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what might be causing male packages to, um, flourish so to say? Well, some speculate that better blood flow to the male nether regions might be responsible for the apparent elongation in penile length. Others, including Dr Richard Viney, a consultant urological surgeon at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, theorize that this phenomenon might simply be a function of fat removal in the areas adjoining the penis, which would make a given male appendage appear longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic/Wegovy can cause a host of side effects, including nausea, constipation, diarrhea, and &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/update-fdas-ongoing-evaluation-reports-suicidal-thoughts-or-actions-patients-taking-certain-type"&gt;possible suicidal ideation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, one should never take these drugs without a formal medical recommendation. For those already on GLP-1 drugs though, penile bragging rights might be a hefty ancillary benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

To a more complicated question, there’s a more complicated answer, but an answer nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the Experts: &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionnowcounseling.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Manaker, R.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lauren Manaker, R.D.&lt;/a&gt;, dietitian at MegaFood; and &lt;a href="https://culinahealth.com/founders-tamar-samuels/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tamar Samuels, R.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tamar Samuels, R.D.&lt;/a&gt;, founder and head of clinical partnerships at Culina Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, we break down the main types of vitamins you might take in supplement form, and the ideal times to take them, depending on their qualities and how they support your health. After all, there are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6099991/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:13 main vitamins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;13 main vitamins&lt;/a&gt; that your body needs to work, and they all act a bit differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The best time to take vitamins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The best time to take vitamins really depends on the type of vitamin you’re taking,” says &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionnowcounseling.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Manaker, R.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lauren Manaker, R.D.&lt;/a&gt;, dietitian at MegaFood. Different nutrients are absorbed better at specific times of day. “For example, water-soluble vitamins like vitamin C and B vitamins can be taken any time of the day, as long as it works for you, but they’re often best absorbed on an empty stomach,” she continues. “On the other hand, fat-soluble vitamins like vitamins A, D, E, and K are better taken with a meal that contains healthy fats to help with absorption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some vitamins have immediate effects that make them better suited for morning or night. For example, vitamin B12 (often an ingredient in energy drinks) is usually better taken in the morning, “because it plays a key role in energy production and may help reduce feelings of fatigue,” says Manaker. “On the other hand, magnesium is commonly taken in the evening as it has a calming effect on the body, helping to relax muscles and support a good night’s sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, the best time to take your vitamins is whenever you can remember to take them consistently, adds &lt;a href="https://culinahealth.com/founders-tamar-samuels/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tamar Samuels, R.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tamar Samuels, R.D.&lt;/a&gt;, founder and head of clinical partnerships at Culina Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Types of vitamins and when to take them&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing and how you take vitamins can vary depending on whether they are water-soluble or fat-soluble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fat-soluble vitamins&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fat-soluble vitamins, including &lt;strong&gt;vitamins A, D, E, and K&lt;/strong&gt;, rely on fat to absorb properly, “which is why pairing them with a meal containing healthy fats, like avocado, nuts, or olive oil, can be beneficial,” says Manaker. These vitamins are also stored in your body after absorption, which allows you to use them gradually over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to both Manaker and Samuels, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g21288692/vitamin-a-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin A;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin A&lt;/a&gt; plays important roles in vision, skin, and immune health; &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g20506205/12-foods-high-in-vitamin-d/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; contributes to bone, immune, and hormone health; vitamin E is an antioxidant that promotes anti-inflammation and skin repair; and vitamin K works against blood clotting and also promotes bone health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Water-soluble vitamins&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water-soluble vitamins like &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a64161408/best-time-to-take-vitamin-b/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:B vitamins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;B vitamins&lt;/a&gt; and vitamin C &lt;/strong&gt;dissolve in water and are absorbed quickly, explains Manaker. “Your body doesn’t store them in large amounts, and you excrete what you don’t need through urine,” she says. “This means you need to replenish water-soluble vitamins regularly in your diet.” It’s a good idea to take water-soluble vitamins with food or a glass of water in the mornings, she concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g20511745/9-foods-with-more-vitamin-c-than-an-orange/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Vitamins C;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Vitamins C&lt;/a&gt;, B6, B12, folate, and biotin are are crucial for energy production, immune function, nerve health, metabolism, and maintaining healthy skin and cells, say Manaker and Samuels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Multi-vitamins&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multi-vitamins are daily supplements formulated to contain all the vitamins your body needs in one daily capsule or gummy. “The best time to take a multi-vitamin really depends on your routine, but consistency is key,” says Manaker. “Some people prefer taking them in the morning with breakfast to establish a habit. Others might take them in the evening if it’s easier to remember.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, if yours contains energizing vitamins like B12, mornings might be a better choice, Manaker adds. Many people take theirs with a meal to avoid an upset stomach. “If you take iron or magnesium in your multivitamin, avoid pairing it with calcium-rich foods (like milk or cheese), which can compete for absorption,” recommends Samuels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Should you take vitamins with food?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fat-soluble vitamins (like A, D, E, and K) are absorbed better when taken with a meal that includes healthy fats. However, water-soluble vitamins (like B and C) don’t require fat for absorption and can sometimes be taken on an empty stomach. “That said, taking vitamins with food generally helps reduce the chance of any stomach discomfort,” says Manaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Should you take vitamins, period?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always consult your doctor before changing your routine. As with any supplement, you should only be taking vitamins if you’ve been diagnosed with a deficiency. Otherwise, you can make sure you’re getting the right balance of them through a well-rounded diet of fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, and lean proteins (see: the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/diets/a30326160/mediterranean-diet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Getting nutrients from food is best because whole foods provide fiber, phytonutrients, and other compounds that supplements can’t replicate,” says Manaker. “However, vitamins can be a smart option for people with specific nutrient deficiencies, dietary restrictions, or increased nutrient needs (like during pregnancy). Lab work, guidance from a dietitian, or monitoring your overall wellness can help identify if supplements could support your health goals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Manaker and Samuels recommend looking for supplements that are third-party tested for purity and potency, and avoiding falling for social media trends that may encourage you to stray from your prescribed regimen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet. They are not medicines and are not intended to treat, diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or cure diseases. Be cautious about taking dietary supplements if you are pregnant or nursing. Also, be careful about giving supplements to a child, unless recommended by their healthcare provider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 14:12:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTFA0eXQ0ZnBjeE8xc05ibWZ5Z1dDR3NxcmdmWmx1XzRuRDdRclRCNzlLMVljYm0wN05ncHozcEhzV3phRGZEc0x6RUtPTEpaeTE0OG0wSDBVcGdybEZ1MVV1cWxQTHBHQjZhdFFzVHgwV2Npdw</guid></item><item><title>根据营养学家的说法，最好的抗炎食品- AOL.com | The Best Anti-Inflammatory Food, According to a Nutritionist - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE5HUWFNOVNoUjBxbGNuU3Z5QXFPaFlUTmRGcHFfdktjVzlMSmNTakRZcTF0WnhJVk9COGt5empJTF9Mc1J1ZDV5MnV3dUxPQ0tORl91UjhIVnhtMy1ZRXVjQjZDNDFvUHBoUVNoN1NWT0RhaFZUWDVNNnJveng?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;This Nut Helps Lower Inflammation Naturally&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Eva Katalin Kondoros - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s been a lot of chatter about inflammation over the past few years.

The diet involves “a pattern of eating focused on incorporating nutrient-dense, whole foods that support your body’s natural defenses,” according to Manaker. “This dietary pattern is about abundance—more colorful plants, more healthy fats, and fewer ultra-processed, sugary, and fried foods.” Think: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and fatty fish rich in omega-3s, such as salmon and mackerel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check out more about combatting inflammation through food in &lt;a href="https://shop.prevention.com/prevention-28day-antiinflammatory-diet-1725915612854/p" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Prevention’s 28-day Anti-inflammatory Diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prevention’s&lt;/em&gt; 28-day Anti-inflammatory Diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 14:10:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE5HUWFNOVNoUjBxbGNuU3Z5QXFPaFlUTmRGcHFfdktjVzlMSmNTakRZcTF0WnhJVk9COGt5empJTF9Mc1J1ZDV5MnV3dUxPQ0tORl91UjhIVnhtMy1ZRXVjQjZDNDFvUHBoUVNoN1NWT0RhaFZUWDVNNnJveng</guid></item><item><title>需要注意的低睾酮症状以及如何处理- GQ | The Low-Testosterone Symptoms to Look Out for—and How to Handle Them - GQ</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX0FVX3lxTE50NDhnenRQbGVpN1E2OVQ3dEpnX2E3N1M4b05peFlWdGJLcEJoN0x4akpGUm00d0xfc2hqT203dkdTUDdOMXp0UjY0MEMzTDcwUFJ2bTRJcTdrZjFId2Q4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This age-based decline in testosterone is distinct from more cut-and-dry medical conditions, like Kleinfelder syndrome, where men are born with an extra X chromosome. These medical conditions are often treated with TRT; how far the therapy is applicable to others who have low testosterone symptoms is more controversial. Healthy men generally only have a “slight decline” in testosterone levels as they age, says Kelly, and only when they’re in their 70s and 80s. Testosterone levels declining earlier and more severely usually happens because of other health issues, like inflammation, obesity and type 2 diabetes. Things in your diet like &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/a-simple-rule-for-a-better-diet"&gt;processed foods&lt;/a&gt; and endocrine-disrupting chemicals found in some plastic packaging can affect testosterone levels too. The important thing is your average level, Kelly stresses, as it changes throughout the day and even between seasons. It’s true that over-exercising can cause your testosterone levels to drop, he says, “but it’s a transient thing”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most cases, Kelly thinks the crucial thing for keeping your testosterone levels up is just a healthy lifestyle: &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-to-start-working-out"&gt;exercising&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/3-simple-rules-for-a-better-diet"&gt;eating well&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-to-sleep-better-according-to-sleep-experts"&gt;sleeping well&lt;/a&gt;. In short, all the things we know we should be doing. An exception where TRT “might be a really useful and beneficial therapy for some men” is to help break the cycle of poor health— because if you’re obese, “and then that lowers your testosterone, your lower testosterone contributes to you not processing sugar and fat as well, so you become more obese.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foster is more bullish about the benefits of TRT. He views the testosterone decline in middle-aged men as akin to menopause in women, and something that lifestyle changes will help, but can’t fix. “You can eat all the &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/zinc-deficiency#:~:text=Zinc%20deficiency%20is%20often%20linked,or%20even%20eczema%2Dlike%20rashes."&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt; and selenium [supplements] you want,” he says, “but it’s not going to make your testicles the same as they were 10 years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cites—as Kelly does—studies that link low testosterone in men to an increased risk of mortality. A healthier lifestyle might push you up to the lower end of what the NHS considers a “normal” testosterone level—about eight nanomoles per litre—but “all those risks associated with your health aren’t going to suddenly resolve.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s very wary, though, about prescribing TRT to younger men under 30 who don’t have an obvious medical condition. Your natural testosterone levels “keep going higher each year to the age of 30ish,” he says. “If we start disrupting this when you’re 22, how do I know I’m not causing damage for when you’re 40, 50, 60?” He finds the trend of under-30s getting on TRT, especially in the &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/zinc-deficiency#:~:text=Zinc%20deficiency%20is%20often%20linked,or%20even%20eczema%2Dlike%20rashes."&gt;bodybuilding&lt;/a&gt; world, absolutely terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obsession in some corners of the internet with maximizing your testosterone can lead to some weird habits. On Reddit’s &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.reddit.com/r/Testosterone/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Testosterone/"}' href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Testosterone/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dedicated testosterone forum&lt;/a&gt;, one user offers a unique prescription: “Carnivore diet. Semen retention (no porn). Heavy lifting. Lots of sunlight exposure… especially on the testicles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Kelly tells me, it’s a minefield out there. Abstaining from masturbation has been proved to raised testosterone only among “a handful of people”—and that has to be weighed against the much clearer benefits of regular orgasm. If you’re concerned about low testosterone, d&lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/joe-holder-exercise-snack-short-workout"&gt;o get in shape&lt;/a&gt; and get your diet sorted, and possibly, depending on your age, consider TRT.

And voilà, you’ve just created a “bucket of doom” that will kill developing mosquito larvae and &lt;a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/lifestyle/gardening/a65037207/how-to-get-rid-of-mosquitoes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:eliminate mosquito problems;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;eliminate mosquito problems&lt;/a&gt; in your backyard. It’s easy, quick, and cheap! But like most things that sound too good to be true, this hack has plenty of flaws. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s an oversimplification of the problem,” says entomologist Elmer Gray, a public health specialist and researcher at the &lt;a href="https://www.caes.uga.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:University of Georgia College of Agricultural &amp;amp; Environmental Sciences;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;University of Georgia College of Agricultural &amp;amp; Environmental Sciences&lt;/a&gt;. “The concept shows a lack of understanding of mosquito biology.” For starters, this method only attracts &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; types of mosquitoes (more about that later), and it only kills off mosquito larvae, not the bug at any other stages of its life cycle, including the biting adult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Although those traps are technically sound, in and of themselves, they are unlikely to control all the mosquitoes around your home,” says Daniel Markowski, Ph.D., technical advisor with the &lt;a href="https://www.mosquito.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Mosquito Control Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American Mosquito Control Association&lt;/a&gt; (AMCA). “In addition, without proper care, they could lead to other significant concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One of the most worrisome issues is that five-gallon buckets are a &lt;a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/news/Pages/Child-Drownings-AAP-Finds-Layers-of-Protection-Key-to-Prevent-Tragedies.aspx?_gl=1%2Aqzygrz%2A_ga%2ANTI4MDU4MDI1LjE3NTA2OTAwODE.%2A_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ%2AczE3NTA5NTQxNzgkbzIkZzAkdDE3NTA5NTQxNzgkajYwJGwwJGgw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:drowning risk for toddlers and young kids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;drowning risk for toddlers and young kids&lt;/a&gt;. These buckets are also unsafe for small pets and wildlife. Do you want to fish a drowned chipmunk or &lt;a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/lifestyle/gardening/a65088873/keep-squirrels-out-of-garden/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:baby squirrel;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;baby squirrel&lt;/a&gt; out of your bucket every other day? We think not. Although some suggest inserting a stick for the animal to climb out, that’s unlikely to be helpful to a panicking animal. Ditto for using a screen over the bucket: too fine of a screen and mosquitoes can’t get through, while openings that are too big or a screen that’s too flimsy could allow an animal to get tangled up in it. And don’t even get us started on how hideous these buckets look on your deck or around your garden!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Read on to learn what else our entomologists and mosquito experts say you should know about the “bucket of doom”—and what you should do instead to reduce mosquitoes in your backyard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What to Know About Mosquitoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Susan Ellis, Bugwood.org&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Mosquitos are biting pests that have been around for millions of years, so you’re not going to get rid of them easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Mosquitoes are the most adaptable insect on earth,” says Rafia Khan, Ph.D., assistant professor and extension entomologist at &lt;a href="https://agrilifeextension.tamu.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Texas A&amp;amp;M AgriLife Research and Extension Center;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Texas A&amp;amp;M AgriLife Research and Extension Center&lt;/a&gt;. “They’re found everywhere from mountains to coastlines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The life cycle includes egg, larva, pupa, and then adult mosquito—and this progression takes as little as a couple of weeks. Some females lay eggs only once, while others can do it multiple times throughout their lives. Every time the female reproduces, she must have a blood meal, says Khan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What Is BTi?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One of the components of the “bucket of doom” is &lt;em&gt;Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis&lt;/em&gt; (or BTi for short!), a naturally-occurring bacterium found in soil. BTi is available in the form of mosquito dunks or granules. When mosquito larvae ingest BTi spores, the toxins dissolve the lining of their guts, causing death within a few days, says Khan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;BTi is specifically used to kill mosquitoes (as well as other pests such as black flies and fungus gnats), but it doesn’t harm people, pets, butterflies, bees, fish, frogs, or other beneficial species. Therefore, when used as directed, this product can be useful for water sources you can’t dump out, like a rain barrel, self-watering containers, or birdbaths, says Gray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Why the "Bucket of Doom" Doesn't Work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;BTi is effective for killing mosquito larvae, but the “bucket of doom” concept doesn’t take into account many other facts, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You might not have the kind of mosquitoes that deposit eggs in containers.&lt;/strong&gt; Different species can be prevalent depending on where you live. But while all mosquitoes require water for their eggs to hatch, not all species have the same behaviors. Species such as floodwater mosquitoes and salt marsh mosquitoes lay eggs in wet soil. Others may lay eggs in short-lived pools or tree holes. So, they’re not even going to look at your bucket, says Gray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mosquitoes don’t put all their eggs in one basket (or bucket!)&lt;/strong&gt;. “The majority of mosquitoes that oviposit, or lay eggs, in containers, don’t lay all their eggs in one place,” says Gray. “They will lay 30 to 50 eggs here and 30 to 50 eggs there to ensure survival.” That means the female can lay plenty of eggs &lt;em&gt;outside of&lt;/em&gt; your bucket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bucket doesn’t kill the adults.&lt;/strong&gt; “You’ll still have the adult mosquitoes flying around after laying their eggs, and, depending on certain factors, they can live for four to six weeks,” says Markowski. “After they lay their eggs, they’ll be looking for another bloodmeal.” And that means you’re on the menu!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The adults can transmit diseases.&lt;/strong&gt; If the female has bitten an animal infected with diseases such as West Nile virus, Zika virus, encephalitis, or dengue, you can be infected when she bites you, says Gray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adults can fly for miles.&lt;/strong&gt; While many species live and bite within a few hundred yards of their breeding site, others can fly from one to 10 miles from their hatching site, says Khan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BTi doesn’t last forever&lt;/strong&gt;. If the weather is hot and humid, or it sits in the sun for too long, BTi can lose its effectiveness quickly, says Khan. In high temperatures and direct sunlight, it may only last for seven days. And because BTi does not affect the other stages of the mosquito life cycle, including the eggs, pupae, and adult mosquitoes, you could risk just creating a bigger problem because you won’t know when the BTi has lost its effectiveness. Finally, do you want to keep hauling buckets of icky, putrefying water around? We didn’t think so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How Do You Get Rid of Mosquitoes?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Penpak Ngamsathain - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Here's the bottom line: “For the few mosquitoes you’re taking out with the 'bucket of doom,' you’re drawing more in. And you’re not killing the adults,” says Gray. “There also are no studies that have shown that this will reduce the population.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So, if mosquitoes are currently taking over your backyard and you're looking for a safer and more effective way to eliminate them, here's what Gray suggests:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get rid of breeding places.&lt;/strong&gt; Dump out standing water in baby pools, saucers under flower pots, wheelbarrows, and tarps. Clean gutters and refill birdbaths every few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use mosquito dunks &lt;/strong&gt;in spots you can’t drain water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep your yard tidy. &lt;/strong&gt;Mosquitoes like to hide in vegetation from the heat. Cut back grasses and keep hedges trimmed near areas where you spend time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wear bug repellents.&lt;/strong&gt; EPA-approved repellants such as 2-undecanone (made from the stems of wild tomatoes), picaridin, and DEET will protect you from bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wear light colors and loose-fitting clothing&lt;/strong&gt;. Mosquitoes are attracted to dark clothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forget about candles, sonic devices, bracelets, and “mosquito-repelling plants.”&lt;/strong&gt; They don’t work.

						&lt;p&gt;Matt Cross has a life mission: to train young men to become leaders. Mostly he does that through example. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Cross is a youth hockey coach, raised in Toronto and a Raleigh transplant. “As an athlete, I'm always trying to encourage and teach my athletes to be courageous and be brave and to be responsible,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;After a cancer diagnosis at age 36, he’s added another element to that mission. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Because I work with a lot of families and a lot of young people, it was very easy for me to decide that there was a reason why I was going through this,” he says. “It was very easy for me to look at this as an opportunity to make my family and friends proud and to show young people what you do when you have a really difficult obstacle in your life.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;It was a visit from his father that led Cross to face that obstacle: Testicular cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;His father was having heart problems and trying to understand what was going on. So Cross offered to wear an Apple Watch so they could compare EKG readings. When Cross got an abnormal reading, he promised his dad he’d check with a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Cross had another question ready for that appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/matt-cross-cancer-wral-june-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/matt-cross-cancer-wral-june-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“While I was getting my physical, I said, ‘Hey, you know, why don't you check out this lump,’” he recalls. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“I had a lump on my testicle that was there for a number of months, and – typical guy – I figured I'd go to the doctor when I had a real reason to go to the doctor,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;His dad and the abnormal EKG provided that reason.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The answer came on Christmas Day 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“I was stage 2B. Stage 2B means that the cancer originated in the testicle,” Cross says. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/matt-cross-cancer-wral-june-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/matt-cross-cancer-wral-june-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Testicular cancer is the number one most common cancer for men ages 15 to 35. The standard treatment is removal of the testical that contains the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;As a coach, Cross understood being in the fight, but he was looking for a win. Aware of the tradition of cancer survivors ringing a bell to signify that they had reached remission, Cross was disappointed when at first he didn’t see a bell at his doctor’s office.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;He endured two surgeries and three cycles of chemotherapy, a total of 15 full days of infusions.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“The story goes, when I came in for my very last day of treatment, they had installed a bell,” he says. “So I was able to have a celebration and ring it.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“As a cancer patient and survivor, you learn to celebrate all the wins, the small ones, the big ones,” Cross says.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;It’s that message he’s shared with his players and their parents.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Cancer is all sorts of life lessons kind of thrown at you all at once,” Cross says. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“For a lot of people, it's devastating, and you're sick and you're literally just trying to survive. But if you can somehow get to that place where you're learning and you're growing and you're helping other people, I really think that's the way that you should try to go.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“The most amazing thing that ever happened to me was getting sick. It's nuts. No pun intended.” &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Cross was surrounded by support from the hockey community throughout his fight.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/matt-cross-cancer-wral-june-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/matt-cross-cancer-wral-june-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;He recalls, “That looked like emails, phone calls, texts, food gift cards, a GoFundMe. A lot of the local hockey teams taped their sticks purple and put ribbons on their jerseys.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;That support notched up the pressure for Cross to get well. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“It was really a big part of my fight; I can't let these people down,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;In remission for five years, Cross has returned to his mission of modeling leadership. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;A year to the day after his diagnosis, Cross launched the Raleigh Testicular Cancer Foundation. The goal is specifically to raise awareness and to educate about testicular cancer, and generally to get men to pay attention to their own health. &lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;“Our slogan for our charity is Check Your Acorns. That's kind of like a clever, cute way to encourage men and young people to perform self checks,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We're trying to tear down stigmas so that men book that doctor's appointment and that annual physical.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Cross points to the widespread acceptance and awareness of the need for self-exams for breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Men need that extra nudge, he says, to understand the risks of ignoring their bodies’ warning signs. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“It's not about being masculine and being strong,” he says, “it's about saving your life, potentially. The cure rates for cancer when you find them in stage one are significantly higher.”&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;h2&gt;Diagnosis: Young. The New Face of Cancer in NC&lt;/h2&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt; "Diagnosis: Young. The New Face of Cancer in NC" is the latest investigative documentary from the WRAL Doc unit, exploring the alarming trend of cancer striking younger adults in North Carolina and across the nation. The documentary follows three North Carolinians in their 20s and 30s who never expected a cancer diagnosis so early in life. Behind every personal story is the big question: Why is this happening?  &lt;/p&gt;

From bone health to mood regulation,  Vitamin D helps in all this and much more. However, considering the poor food choices most people make and the lack of exposure to sunlight regularly-- many across the world suffer from vitamin D deficiency. Another reason for it is that signs of Vitamin D deficiency are often subtle and so, they get ignored easily. But the good part is that by recognising these early warning signs and taking prompt timely testing and treatment— whether through safe sun exposure, dietary changes, or supplementation- Vitamin D deficiency can be treated.

			&lt;p&gt;We spend a third of our lives asleep. And a quarter of our time asleep is spent dreaming. So, for the average person alive in 2022, with a life expectancy of around &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mortality-and-global-health-estimates/ghe-life-expectancy-and-healthy-life-expectancy"&gt;73&lt;/a&gt;, that clocks in at just over six years of dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, given the central role that dreaming plays in our lives, we still know so little about why we dream, how the brain creates dreams, and importantly, what the significance of our dreams might be for our health – especially the health of our brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My 2022 study, published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet's&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(22)00370-4/fulltext"&gt;&lt;em&gt;eClinicalMedicine&lt;/em&gt; journal&lt;/a&gt;, showed that our dreams can reveal a surprising amount of information about our brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More specifically, it showed that having frequent bad dreams and nightmares (bad dreams that make you wake up) during middle or older age, may be linked with an increased risk of developing &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dementia/symptoms/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fda-approved-sleeping-pill-slows-alzheimers-tangles-in-pre-clinical-trial?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;FDA-Approved Sleeping Pill Slows Alzheimer's Tangles in Pre-Clinical Trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, I analyzed data from three large US studies of health and aging. These included over 600 people aged between 35 and 64, and 2,600 people aged 79 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the participants were dementia-free at the start of the study and were followed for an average of nine years for the middle-aged group and five years for the older participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the study (2002-12), the participants completed a range of questionnaires, including one which asked about how often they experienced bad dreams and nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143068" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143068" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nightmare_hands.jpg" alt="man in bed surrounded by hands" class="wp-image-143068 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nightmare_hands.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nightmare_hands-600x325.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143068" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Frequent nightmares could be a sign of declining mental health. (Kirk Marsh/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I analyzed the data to find out whether participants with a higher frequency of nightmares at the beginning of the study were more likely to go on to experience cognitive decline (a fast decline in memory and thinking skills over time) and be diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Weekly nightmares&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found that middle-aged participants who experienced nightmares every week, were four times more likely to experience cognitive decline (&lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.12704"&gt;a precursor to dementia)&lt;/a&gt; over the following decade, while the older participants were twice as likely to be diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the connection between nightmares and future dementia was much stronger for men than for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, older men who had nightmares every week were five times more likely to develop dementia compared with older men reporting no bad dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In women, however, the increase in risk was only 41 percent. I found a very similar pattern in the middle-aged group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, these results suggest frequent nightmares may be one of the earliest signs of dementia, which can precede the development of memory and thinking problems by several years or even decades – especially in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, it is also possible that having regular bad dreams and nightmares might even be a cause of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the nature of this study, it is not possible to be certain which of these theories is correct (though I suspect it is the former).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, regardless of which theory turns out to be true – the major implication of the study remains the same, that is, that having regular bad dreams and nightmares during middle and older age may be linked to an increased risk of developing dementia later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that recurring nightmares are &lt;a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.7178"&gt;treatable&lt;/a&gt;. And the first-line medical treatment for nightmares has already been shown to decrease the build-up of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458012004666?via%3Dihub"&gt;abnormal proteins&lt;/a&gt; linked to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143082" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143082" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642.jpg" alt="Illustration of yellow clumps on pink nerve cells" class="size-full wp-image-143082" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642-621x415.jpg 621w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143082" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Abnormal clumps of amyloid-beta proteins are linked to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="165966" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease.

This will be an important avenue to explore in future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next steps for my research include investigating whether nightmares in young people might also be linked to increased dementia risk. This could help to determine whether nightmares cause dementia, or whether they are simply an early sign in some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also plan to investigate whether other dream characteristics, such as how often we remember our dreams and how vivid they are, might also help to determine how likely people are to develop dementia in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research might not only help to shed light on the relationship between dementia and dreaming, and provide new opportunities for earlier diagnoses – and possibly &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30367-6/fulltext"&gt;earlier interventions&lt;/a&gt; – but it may also shed new light on the nature and function of the mysterious phenomenon that we call &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/why-do-we-dream/"&gt;dreaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/191016/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrer-policy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

A study by Queen Mary University of London found drinking a cup of beetroot juice each day could significantly lower the blood pressure of &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/professor-says-underrated-powerhouse-food-31935659" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;people suffering from hypertension.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study saw patients who suffer from high blood pressure drink a 250ml glass of purple juice every day, by the end of the timeframe the study found a significant reduction into that of a "normal range".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looking at the study, the &lt;a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/what-we-do/news-from-the-bhf/news-archive/2015/january/beetroot-and-blood-pressure" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;British Heart Foundation added&lt;/a&gt;: "This study, involving 64 volunteers, provides the first evidence of a long-lasting reduction in blood pressure by supplementing the diet with nitrates in patients with high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The level of reduction was similar to that from some forms of &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/consultant-cardiologist-says-small-step-31924230" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;blood pressure medication&lt;/a&gt;. No adverse side effects were observed in people taking the daily dose of nitrates, in the form of beetroot juice."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Beetroot isn't the only vegetable high in nitrates, leafy green such as spinach, kale and lettuce as well as carrots, celery, and leeks can all be a great way of including the compound in your diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31117833" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;p&gt;Professor Amrita Ahluwalia, who led the research, added: “This research has proven that a daily inorganic nitrate dose can be as effective as medical intervention in reducing blood pressure and the best part is we can get it from beetroot and other leafy green vegetables.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For those looking to work dietary nitrate into their daily diets, the trick is not to boil the vegetables – as dietary nitrate is water soluble – but steaming, roasting or drinking in a juice all has a positive effect.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The idea of using a natural product instead of medication may be appealing to many, but both the charity and the researcher stressed that more research with a much larger sample size needs to be done before it is used as an official solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 12:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxPbW1PZmh2TjJ4bWRZb1JrTXRod0V0dDgwN0hyTFZBVy1ielQ4OGxsTnI1VGJHVjRjdm1JTmJ0M254bDdfUWkzQlNjaEcwM2VRa2huRUxsOHZIdHpaaUJOdzJZTXpxdWVWcXIyVVU3Um1jbGY1X3M1WTFIcHF1TnBjR0VJanA</guid></item><item><title>疏通动脉的胆固醇超级食物“优于阿司匹林”医生说- Daily Express | Cholesterol superfood that unclogs arteries is 'better than aspirin' doctor says - Daily Express</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix hR new-style"&gt;&lt;div class="photo changeSpace"&gt;&lt;p class="withoutCaption"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/1200x712/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.avif?r=1751030776997" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/1200x712/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.webp?r=1751030776997" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/1200x712/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.jpg?r=1751030776997" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/674x400/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.avif?r=1751030776997" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/674x400/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.webp?r=1751030776997" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/674x400/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.jpg?r=1751030776997" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/940x/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.avif?r=1751030776997" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/940x/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.webp?r=1751030776997" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/940x/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.jpg?r=1751030776997" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/590x/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.avif?r=1751030776997" media="screen"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/590x/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.webp?r=1751030776997" media="screen"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/590x/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.jpg?r=1751030776997" alt="Female hands with pills" title="Female hands with pills"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="newsCaption"&gt;The superfood has been shown to work well at keeping arteries clear, similarly to aspirin &lt;span class="caption"&gt;(Image: Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A health expert has identified a specific superfood that he claims clears arteries "better than aspirin". Dr Eric Berg DC, a ketosis specialist and renowned health educator with 13.5 million subscribers on his &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" title="YouTube" href="/latest/youtube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; channel, has shared the benefits of this 'number one' food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining clear and healthy arteries is crucial. &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/life-style/health/2041306/cholesterol-go-down-seven-days-you-follow-experts-meal-plan"&gt;Clogged arteries restrict blood flow&lt;/a&gt;.

It primarily consists of surplus 'bad' cholesterol (LDL cholesterol), fatty substances, cellular waste, calcium, and fibrin (a clotting aid), reports &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/doctor-says-cholesterol-lowering-food-31946538" rel="nofollow"&gt;Surrey Live&lt;/a&gt;.

This period is inherently riskier due to a surge in cortisol and adrenaline, which can increase blood clotting. It’s the body's natural morning changes like higher blood pressure and heart rate, coupled with an enhanced chance of clotting, that amplify the threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his video titled: "#1 Best Food to Unclog Arteries", accompanied by a thumbnail proclaiming: "Better than aspirin", Dr Berg told viewers: "Find out about the number one best food in the world to help unclog arteries and prevent

id="newsletter-place"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The main causes of arterial blockages include:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An abundance of "bad" cholesterol (LDL) can lead to worrying plaque formation in our arteries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elevated blood pressure, notorious for its damaging effect on artery walls, creates a fertile ground for further plaque buildup.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smoking pushes toxins into the bloodstream, injuring artery walls and fuelling inflammation, which, in turn, encourages plaque to form.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diabetes' impact on blood vessel health is profound, with high sugar levels increasing the danger of plaque accumulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obesity adds fuel to the fire, sparking high cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, and diabetes—all of which contribute to the menace of clogged arteries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A sedentary lifestyle can trigger a cascade of issues, including weight gain and increased cholesterol and blood pressure, all enemy agents in the fight against arterial health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your immediate family members have been diagnosed with heart disease, you may be at a higher risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As you age, the probability of developing atherosclerosis increases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persistent stress can trigger inflammation, which can exacerbate plaque accumulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can aspirin aid in unclogging arteries?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link"

rel="nofollow"&gt;Aspirin can help with clogged arteries&lt;/a&gt;, but it doesn't directly treat the blockage. It's an antiplatelet medication that prevents blood clots from forming in narrowed arteries, which could lead to heart attacks or strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspirin doesn't eliminate the plaque causing the blockages. Instead, it helps manage the risk of complications resulting from these blockages. Doctors often recommend aspirin for people who already have heart disease or are at high risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke, particularly after undergoing procedures like angioplasty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, aspirin isn't suitable for everyone, especially those without a history of heart disease or those at an increased risk of bleeding. It's crucial to seek advice from a healthcare professional before starting aspirin therapy, as it can cause side effects such as stomach bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="photo changeSpace"&gt;&lt;p class="withoutCaption"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/1200x712/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.avif?r=1751030783662" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/1200x712/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.webp?r=1751030783662" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/1200x712/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.jpg?r=1751030783662" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/674x400/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.avif?r=1751030783662" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/674x400/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.webp?r=1751030783662" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/674x400/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.jpg?r=1751030783662" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/940x/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.avif?r=1751030783662" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/940x/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.webp?r=1751030783662" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/940x/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.jpg?r=1751030783662" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/590x/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.avif?r=1751030783662" media="screen"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/590x/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.webp?r=1751030783662" media="screen"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/590x/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.jpg?r=1751030783662" alt="fish oil capsules spilling out from the bottle" title="fish oil capsules spilling out from the bottle" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="newsCaption"&gt;EPA not only suppresses atherosclerotic development but also stabilises atherosclerotic plaque &lt;span class="caption"&gt;(Image: Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whatsapp-group "&gt; &lt;strong class="wapp-head"&gt; Get top stories from The Express sent straight to your phone &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class="wapp-btn" href="https://www.express.co.uk/whatsapp-group-web/11?utm_source=article_widget&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article_widget&amp;amp;utm_content=whatsapp-group-signup-in-article"&gt;Join us on WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wapp-inf"&gt;Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners.

Dr Berg recommends eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), an omega-3 fatty acid, as a natural alternative that doesn't carry the same negative impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EPA is recognised for its ability to &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/17290-omega-3-fatty-acids#:~:text=Omega%2D3%20fatty%20acids%20are,)%2C%20flaxseed%20and%20chia%20seeds." rel="nofollow"&gt;reduce triglyceride levels&lt;/a&gt;, a type of fat found in the blood. High triglycerides can increase the risk of heart disease. EPA can help decrease non-HDL cholesterol, which includes LDL (the harmful kind) and other detrimental cholesterol particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405457724001992#:~:text=last%2010%20years.-,Results,associated%20with%20atherosclerotic%20plaque%20rupture." rel="nofollow"&gt;EPA helps prevent blocked arteries by making your platelets less sticky&lt;/a&gt;. Research has shown that EPA can thin the blood comparably to low-dose Aspirin," says Dr Berg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7023944/#:~:text=Staining%20of%20the%20aorta%20revealed,content%20with%20less%20macrophage%20infiltration." rel="nofollow"&gt;EPA can stabilise vulnerable arterial plaques&lt;/a&gt; by decreasing inflammation. &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7308541/" rel="nofollow"&gt;A 2019 study&lt;/a&gt; found that individuals who consumed EPA saw a significant reduction in plaque, decreased inflammation, and fewer cardiovascular events. It can also positively influence your mood by reducing cortisol and adrenaline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Berg cites salmon, mackerel, fatty fish, and fish oil as some of the best sources of EPA. However, he suggests there's an even superior source. "Cod liver oil or cod liver is the best food to unclog your arteries naturally," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British Heart Foundation highlights oily fish such as salmon, mackerel, herring, sardines, and anchovies as excellent sources of EPA. Cod liver oil, oysters, and certain white fish and shellfish also contain EPA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plant-based alternatives like flax seeds, chia seeds, and walnuts provide ALA, which the body can convert into EPA, albeit not as efficiently as obtaining EPA directly from fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="photo changeSpace"&gt;&lt;p class="withoutCaption"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/1200x712/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.avif?r=1751030783670" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/1200x712/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.webp?r=1751030783670" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/1200x712/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.jpg?r=1751030783670" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/674x400/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.avif?r=1751030783670" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/674x400/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.webp?r=1751030783670" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/674x400/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.jpg?r=1751030783670" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/940x/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.avif?r=1751030783670" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/940x/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.webp?r=1751030783670" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/940x/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.jpg?r=1751030783670" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/590x/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.avif?r=1751030783670" media="screen"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/590x/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.webp?r=1751030783670" media="screen"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/590x/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.jpg?r=1751030783670" alt="Atherosclerosis stages, illustration" title="Atherosclerosis stages, illustration" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="newsCaption"&gt;Blocked arteries put you at high risk of various medical conditions &lt;span class="caption"&gt;(Image: Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Berg adds: "Along with EPA, cod liver oil contains vitamins A and D. The active form of vitamin A, retinol, aids in repairing the body's internal tissues. It's also a potent anti-inflammatory and can help decrease atherosclerotic plaque."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2015 animal study titled: "Aspirin enhances protective effect of fish oil against thrombosis and injury‐induced vascular remodelling," notes: "Although aspirin is commonly used to prevent ischaemic events in patients with coronary artery disease, many patients fail to respond to aspirin treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dietary fish oil (FO), containing ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), has anti‐inflammatory and cardio‐protective properties, such as lowering cholesterol and modulating platelet activity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3331709/#:~:text=These%20data%20suggest%20that%20EPA,inflammation%20and%20angiogenesis%20than%20aspirin." rel="nofollow"&gt;Another study concludes that EPA can be more beneficial&lt;/a&gt;, stating: "EPA+DHA has more pronounced down-regulatory effects on inflammation and angiogenesis than aspirin."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While recent studies indicate optimistic outcomes, the efficacy of omega 3 has garnered varying results, thereby necessitating more research. Some authorities argue that omega 3 hasn't yet matched aspirin's effectiveness, and they caution against discontinuing aspirin without the go-ahead from your cardiologist or alternate recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Berg added to the discussion, emphasising vitamin D's merit based on research: "&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537021002777" rel="nofollow"&gt;In one study&lt;/a&gt;, out of 1000 compounds, vitamin D was the most effective at preventing damage to the internal layer of the arteries. Vitamin D increases nitric oxide and the stiffness of the arteries. It's a potent anti-inflammatory, stabilises plaque, prevents rupture, and decreases arterial calcification."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) fish oil is generally deemed harmless for the majority when ingested in recommended doses.

However, there are instances where a pimple can be a warning sign of something &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/latest/skin-cancer"&gt;far more serious.&lt;/a&gt; A doctor has revealed that what appears to be a run-of-the-mill spot on the face could be an early indication of a &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/life-style/health/2073773/correct-way-apply-sunscreen"&gt;deadly skin cancer.&lt;/a&gt; His main message is to get it checked if in doubt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking to &lt;a href="https://www.express.co.uk/latest/tiktok" data-link-tracking="InArticle|AutoLink"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drmichaelsays/video/7374725760390565137?lang=en%20(already%20approved)" rel="nofollow"&gt;Doctor Michael Mrozinski&lt;/a&gt; shed light on basal cell skin cancer, a type of skin cancer that commonly develops on sun-exposed areas, such as the face. Commenting on another user's video about a spot near their nose, he said: "So that right there is a perfect example of what an early basal cell skin &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/uk/2067910/alarming-rise-rare-cancer-thats"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; looks like."

He added: "A lot of the time people coming in to see me haven't even realised it could be something like a skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So I've had times where I've said to somebody, what's that on your face and they will see as a pimple, and I'll say, 'How long has it been there for,' and they'll say, 'Six months,' and I'll say, 'Do you think it's normal for a pimple to be hanging around after six months?'".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ovp-primis"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also noted that men often mistake the spot for a shaving cut.

Researchers developed “adaptive computation,” a system that prioritizes important visual details—like traffic signals over flashy cars—based on task relevance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments tracking multiple moving objects, the model successfully predicted where attention would be directed and how difficult people found the task. These findings shed light on why distractions often fade from awareness when we’re focused, and how our brains optimize attention in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptive Computation:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain prioritizes perceptual effort based on goals, filtering out distractions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Attention:&lt;/strong&gt; Attention shifts rapidly and flexibly in response to changing visual demands.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human-Like AI:&lt;/strong&gt; The model may help build AI systems that ignore irrelevant stimuli like humans do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Yale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A person’s capacity for attention has a profound impact on what they see, dictating which details they glean from the world around them. As they walk down a busy street, the focus of their attention may shift to a compelling new billboard advertisement, or a shiny Lamborghini parked on the curb. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attention, however, can be fleeting. When that person reaches a busy intersection, for instance, details of the billboard or sportscar disappear. The person’s attention instead becomes focused on approaching or stationary traffic, the flashing walk sign, and other pedestrians they’ll need to avoid in the crosswalk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111232"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brain-attention-focus-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brain-attention-focus-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brain-attention-focus-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brain-attention-focus-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brain-attention-focus-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brain-attention-focus-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brain-attention-focus-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brain-attention-focus-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a person on a busy street." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brain-attention-focus-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brain-attention-focus-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brain-attention-focus-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brain-attention-focus-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brain-attention-focus-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brain-attention-focus-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brain-attention-focus-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The model also helps make sense of what’s sometimes considered a “human quirk”: the ability to make perceptions of non-task-oriented objects — such as the billboard or the sports car — disappear while crossing the busy street. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most research on attention has concentrated on what happens when we notice the new billboard or shiny car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in a new study, Yale psychologists instead focus on what happens when our attention shifts to a specific goal, such as navigating the busy intersection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;em&gt;Psychological Review&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers unveil a human attention model that explains how the mind evaluates what is task-relevant in complex, dynamic scenarios — and apportions computational capacity in response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a limited number of resources with which we can see the world,” said Ilker Yildirim, assistant professor of psychology in Yale’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences and senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think of these resources as elementary computational processes; each perception we experience, such as the position of an object or how fast it’s moving, is a result of exerting some number of these elementary perceptual computations.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, the researchers developed a system which they call “adaptive computation,” which is essentially a software program that rations these elementary computations in order to more deeply process goal-relevant objects. For example, when a person crosses a busy street, adaptive computation would prioritize the pedestrian walk sign over the shiny car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our model reveals a mechanism by which human attention identifies what things in a dynamic scene are relevant to the goal at hand, and then rations perceptual computations accordingly,” said Mario Belledonne, a graduate student in Yale’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and co-author of the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one experiment, they presented volunteer participants with eight identically colored circles on a computer screen. The researchers then highlighted a group of four circles and asked the participants to track the highlighted circles as all eight circles moved randomly across the screen. Such tracking of multiple objects at the same time elicits a complex, dynamic ebb and flow of attention among the participants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers measured these shifts of attention, at sub-second thresholds, by asking subjects to hit the space bar whenever they noticed a flashing dot appear very briefly on a specific object.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The frequency with which these flashing dots were noticed indicates where and when people are attending, and the adaptive computation model successfully predicted these momentary, fine-grained patterns of attentional deployment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another experiment, participants again were asked to track four objects, but in this case the researchers varied how many identically colored “distractor” objects were on the screen and how fast the objects were moving. When the objects stopped moving, researchers asked participants to rate how difficult it was to track them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers showed that the adaptive computation model also explains these subjective difficulty ratings: The more computational resources the model exerted for tracking, the more difficult it was rated by participants. In this way, the researchers’ model provided a computational signature of the feeling of exertion that occurs when a person focuses attention on the same task for a prolonged period, Yildirim said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to work out the computational logic of the human mind, by creating new algorithms of perception and attention, and comparing the performance of these algorithms to that of humans,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model also helps make sense of what’s sometimes considered a “human quirk”: the ability to make perceptions of non-task-oriented objects — such as the billboard or the sports car — disappear while crossing the busy street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think this line of work can lead to systems that are a bit different from today’s AI, something more human-like,” Yildirim said. “This would be an AI system that when tasked with a goal might miss things, even shiny things, so as to flexibly and safely interact with the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team also included Brian Scholl, a professor of psychology at FAS, and Eivinas Butkus, of Columbia University, a former member of Yildirim’s lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was supported by a grant from U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and attention research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d4b1b8bdaeb5b6b1a0bcfab7bbbababbb8b8ad94adb5b8b1fab1b0a1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Bess Connolly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://yale.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Yale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Bess Connolly – Yale&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/rev0000572" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Adaptive computation as a new mechanism of dynamic human attention&lt;/a&gt;” by Ilker Yildirim et al. &lt;em&gt;Psychological Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptive computation as a new mechanism of dynamic human attention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key role for attention is to continually focus visual processing to satisfy our goals. How does this work in computational terms?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we introduce &lt;em&gt;adaptive computation&lt;/em&gt;—a new computational mechanism of human attention that bridges the momentary application of perceptual computations with their impact on decision outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adaptive computation is a dynamic algorithm that rations perceptual computations across objects on-the-fly, enabled by a novel and general formulation of task relevance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We evaluate adaptive computation in a case study of multiple object tracking (MOT)—a paradigmatic example of selection as a dynamic process, where observers track a set of target objects moving amid visually identical distractors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adaptive computation explains the attentional dynamics of object selection with unprecedented depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It not only recapitulates several classic features of MOT (e.g., trial-level tracking accuracy and localization error of targets), but also captures properties that have not previously been measured or modeled—including both the subsecond patterns of attentional deployment between objects, and the resulting sense of subjective effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critically, this approach captures such data within a framework that is in-principle domain-general, and, unlike past models, without using any MOT-specific heuristic components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond this case study, we also look to the future, discussing how adaptive computation may apply more generally, providing a new type of mechanistic model for the dynamic operation of many forms of visual attention.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 12:33:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5jVkM1Mzl0b0dONkN2NWkxN24xUXRUWkRBeEVKcTREcGEyWjU5UURQd2R6U05URmJpTnVOaVZZOGc3akgzNUJKQXhINzlQMHF6NE5yOTgtd2xDb2RtelBhN09IQ0ZQR01Jd08yLVA1Mkk</guid></item><item><title>营养师说这是服用维生素的最佳时机-预防 | Dietitians Say This Is the Best Time to Take Vitamins - Prevention</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxPLXhqaTlTVVJXTXRfeURMZm5QTGYxdTFKVnF1ZlFtd2pfb3RSdnZTOWpuSXFIYThReXU4RjFxRUpsdHNaSDRoRVYtOG1qWW5IV0c5Q2pnYUh2MVRHSGdTQUd2WFhtRnBoQlFvY3NueHRrWjNTOG9RSDdxNmhXU201N2hGeUNmT1JZQWpPOUViMkFrcjFoUEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-zl6cs0 et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;br data-node-id="1.0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="body-dropcap css-kixdy8 emevuu60"&gt;You’ve thought about the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a63942820/best-time-of-day-take-probiotics/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/a63942820/best-time-of-day-take-probiotics/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="best time to take probiotics" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;best time to take probiotics&lt;/a&gt;, so the natural next question is: When is the best time to take vitamins?

For example, vitamin B12 (often an ingredient in energy drinks) is usually better taken in the morning, “because it plays a key role in energy production and may help reduce feelings of fatigue,” says Manaker. “On the other hand, magnesium is commonly taken in the evening as it has a calming effect on the body, helping to relax muscles and support a good night’s sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Most importantly, the best time to take your vitamins is whenever you can remember to take them consistently, adds &lt;a href="https://culinahealth.com/founders-tamar-samuels/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://culinahealth.com/founders-tamar-samuels/&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1750880351267000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1odaIZhFbu4osF8GqMNpf8" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://culinahealth.com/founders-tamar-samuels/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tamar Samuels, R.D." data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Tamar Samuels, R.D.&lt;/a&gt;, founder and head of clinical partnerships at Culina Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="10" data-lazy-id="P0-14"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Types of vitamins and when to take them" data-anchor-id="types-of-vitamins-and-when-to-take-them" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emt9r7s1"&gt;Types of vitamins and when to take them&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The timing and how you take vitamins can vary depending on whether they are water-soluble or fat-soluble. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="12" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;Fat-soluble vitamins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Fat-soluble vitamins, including &lt;strong data-node-id="13.1"&gt;vitamins A, D, E, and K&lt;/strong&gt;, rely on fat to absorb properly, “which is why pairing them with a meal containing healthy fats, like avocado, nuts, or olive oil, can be beneficial,” says Manaker.

Others might take them in the evening if it’s easier to remember.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Again, if yours contains energizing vitamins like B12, mornings might be a better choice, Manaker adds.  Many people take theirs with a meal to avoid an upset stomach. “If you take iron or magnesium in your multivitamin, avoid pairing it with calcium-rich foods (like milk or cheese), which can compete for absorption,” recommends Samuels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="23" data-lazy-id="P0-15"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Should you take vitamins with food? " data-anchor-id="should-you-take-vitamins-with-food" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emt9r7s1"&gt;Should you take vitamins with food? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Fat-soluble vitamins (like A, D, E, and K) are absorbed better when taken with a meal that includes healthy fats. However, water-soluble vitamins (like B and C) don’t require fat for absorption and can sometimes be taken on an empty stomach. “That said, taking vitamins with food generally helps reduce the chance of any stomach discomfort,” says Manaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="25" data-lazy-id="P0-16"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Should you take vitamins, period?

As with any supplement, you should only be taking vitamins if you’ve been diagnosed with a deficiency. Otherwise, you can make sure you’re getting the right balance of them through a well-rounded diet of fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, and lean proteins (see: the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/diets/a30326160/mediterranean-diet/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/diets/a30326160/mediterranean-diet/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mediterranean diet" data-node-id="26.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Getting nutrients from food is best because whole foods provide fiber, phytonutrients, and other compounds that supplements can’t replicate,” says Manaker. “However, vitamins can be a smart option for people with specific nutrient deficiencies, dietary restrictions, or increased nutrient needs (like during pregnancy). Lab work, guidance from a dietitian, or monitoring your overall wellness can help identify if supplements could support your health goals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Both Manaker and Samuels recommend looking for supplements that are third-party tested for purity and potency, and avoiding falling for social media trends that may encourage you to stray from your prescribed regimen.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="29.0"&gt;Dietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet.

A high acid load interferes with the hormones and enzymes that regulate fat burning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;So even if you eat the same number of calories, your body becomes less efficient at turning them into energy and more prone to storing them as fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Additionally, an acidic environment in your intestines can discourage healthy gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;So, as well as acid loads, participant's weights were also measured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Lowering your acid load can help shred your waist line (Getty Stock Image)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;On the vegan diet, people's acid-load scores dropped, and participants lost about 13 pounds on average. On the Mediterranean diet, acid-load scores stayed roughly the same, and their body weight didn’t change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;So, by switching out acid-producing &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/animals"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt;-based foods for alkaline plant foods and carefully measuring both diet and weight, the scientists could directly link lower acid intake to significant weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;As we already know, a higher weight is linked to other health issues including diabetes, which can in turn increase the risk for heart attacks and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It doesn't mean we should cut meat out altogether, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Instead, try dialing back animal-based servings and pile on alkalizing foods instead - like leafy greens, berries and legumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;That way, your body isn’t stuck fighting an acid overload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;And you might soon notice the difference by way of inflammation, gut health and shedding the pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>UNILAD</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 11:32:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNeTdKXzhKbEpUXzhmTVRIYUtjMEoxWWRraXl2RzU2ZTFpcHNsR25Kdi1UZ2g0Y3RKTTNKUnF5T1NHdVplNlFsend0RElsYkp4OVRpSzdOaFZoZ3Z5MC1Sb0xxOVZTTko0RGR5blJHdWFrMTVYQXZyc1FfV3lVcURyWWg0aUdVd0RUeDFtWTNtbmFtcFB4ZkE</guid></item></channel></rss>
