    &lt;p&gt;After a year of ongoing &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/united-states-measles-outbreak-south-carolina-elimination/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;measles outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that have sickened more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;2,400 people&lt;/a&gt;, the United States is poised to lose its status as a measles-free country. However, the newly appointed principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Ralph Abraham, said he was unbothered by the prospect at a briefing for journalists this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's just the cost of doing business with our borders being somewhat porous for global and international travel," Abraham said. "We have these communities that choose to be unvaccinated. That's their personal freedom."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infections from other countries, however, accounted for only &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/resources/us-measles-tracker" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;about 10%&lt;/a&gt; of measles cases detected since Jan. 20, 2025, the official start of the deadly measles outbreak in West Texas, which spread to other states and Mexico. The rest were acquired domestically. This marks a change since the U.S. eliminated measles in 2000. Measles occasionally popped up in the U.S. from people infected abroad, but the cases rarely sparked outbreaks, because of extremely high rates of vaccination. Two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine strongly &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-many-lives-vaccines-have-saved/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;prevent infection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and halt the virus's spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To maintain its measles elimination status, the U.S. must prove that the virus has not circulated continuously in the nation for a year, between Jan. 20, 2025, and Jan. 20, 2026. To answer the question, &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/measles-virus-outbreak-spread-genomic-analysis-elimination-status-cdc-rfk-us/" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;scientists are examining&lt;/a&gt; whether the major outbreaks in &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/united-states-measles-outbreak-south-carolina-elimination/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Utah, Arizona, and Texas were linked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials confirmed that the main measles virus strain in each of these outbreaks is D8-9171. But because this strain also occurs in Canada and Mexico, CDC scientists are now analyzing the entire genomes of measles viruses — about 16,000 genetic letters long — to see whether those in the United States are more closely related to one another than to those in different countries.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC expects to complete its studies within a couple of months and make the data public. Then the Pan American Health Organization, which oversees the Americas in partnership with the World Health Organization, will decide whether the U.S. will lose its measles elimination status.

      &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"When you hear somebody like Abraham say 'the cost of doing business,' how can you be more callous," said pediatrician and vaccine specialist Paul Offit, in an &lt;a href="https://rasmussenretorts.substack.com/p/one-year-in-how-the-trump-administration?utm_source=live-stream-redirect&amp;amp;triedRedirect=true" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;online discussion&lt;/a&gt; hosted by the health blog &lt;a href="https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/one-year-in-how-the-trump-administration" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Inside Medicine&lt;/a&gt; on Jan. 20. "Three people died of measles last year in this country," Offit added. "We eliminated this virus in the year 2000 — eliminated it. Eliminated circulation of the most contagious human infection. That was something to be proud of."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abraham said vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent measles but that parents must have the freedom to decide whether to vaccinate their children. Several states have loosened school vaccine requirements since 2020, and &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vaccination-rate-decline-measles-polio-outbreaks/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;vaccine rates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/kindergarten-routine-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline/" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;have dropped&lt;/a&gt;. A record rate of kindergartners, representing about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;138,000 children,&lt;/a&gt; obtained &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vaccination-rates-kindergarteners-fall-exemptions-rise/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;vaccine exemptions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the 2024-25 school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information on vaccines has been muddied by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who previously founded an anti-vaccine organization. He has undermined vaccines throughout his tenure. On national television, he has repeated scientifically debunked rumors that vaccines may cause &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/trump-autism-announcement-rfk-tylenol-pregnancy-vaccines/" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-about-measles-vaccine-in-hannity-interview/" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;brain swelling, and death&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University, disparaged the Trump administration's focus on finding genetic technicalities that may spare the country's measles-free status. "This is the wrong thing to pay attention to. Our attention has to be on stopping the outbreaks," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we keep our status, it should be because we have stopped the spread of measles," she said. "It's like they're trying to be graded on a curve."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/texas-measles-outbreak-cdc-vaccines-rfk-trump/" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;impeded the CDC's ability&lt;/a&gt; to assist West Texas during the first critical weeks of its outbreak and &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/russell-vought-trump-omb-doge-public-health-budget-shutdown/" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;slowed the release&lt;/a&gt; of federal emergency funds, according to KFF Health News investigations. However, the agency stepped up its activity last year, providing local health departments with measles vaccines, communication materials, and testing. Abraham said HHS would give South Carolina $1.5 million to respond to its outbreak, which began nearly four months ago and had reached 646 cases as of Jan. 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the CDC's genomic analyses show that last year's outbreaks resulted from separate introductions from abroad, political appointees will probably credit Kennedy for saving the country's status, said Demetre Daskalakis, a former director of the CDC's national immunization center, who &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senior-cdc-officials-resign-after-monarez-ouster-cite-concerns-over-scientific-independence/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;resigned in protest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of Kennedy's actions in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if studies suggest the outbreaks are linked, Daskalakis predicted, the administration will cast doubt on the findings and downplay the reversal of the country's status: "They'll say, who cares."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, at the briefing, Abraham told a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2026/01/20/cdc-measles-briefing-lost-elimination-status-cost-of-doing-business/" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;reporter from Stat&lt;/a&gt; that a reversal in the nation's status would not be significant: "Losing elimination status does not mean that the measles would be widespread."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data shows otherwise. Case counts last year were the highest since 1991, before the government enacted vaccine policies to ensure that all children could be protected with measles immunization.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;JoAnn Chesser, 89, passed away peacefully with family by her side at Diamond Willow, Proctor on January 16, 2026, after a long battle with Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
JoAnn lived a life grounded in kindness, service, and a deep commitment to her family and community. Guided by her faith and a lifelong dedication to helping others, JoAnn was deeply involved at St. Paul’s Episcopalian Church, volunteered at CHUM helped start the Rhubarb Festival, volunteered with Meals on Wheels, and was active in the Whole Foods Co-op community. Whether serving a meal, lending a hand, or sharing a warm smile, she touched countless lives through her generosity and compassion. JoAnn retired from St. Louis County as a social worker, after years of helping others.  She loved to cook and bake around the holidays. She would take the grandchildren on several camping trips where they learned all about “roughing it” and shared several stories over the campfire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
JoAnn is preceded in death by her parents, Milton and Vivian “Lulu” Haff; her brothers, John and Bob; and her sisters, Midgie and Mary Ann. Their memories remained close to her heart throughout her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A devoted mother and nurturing presence, JoAnn is survived by her sons, David (Ann) Chesser and Robert (Lori) Chesser. She also held a special place in her heart for her niece and nephew, Heidi and Brian (Nikki) Cagle, whom she helped raise and loved as her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
JoAnn also leaves behind her sisters Sally, Judy and Lonetta, her sister-in-law Ann, several nieces and nephews, as well as many grandchildren and great-grandchildren, all of whom she cherished deeply. She will be remembered for her gentle spirit, humor, and unwavering love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Visitation will be held on Friday Jan. 30, 2026, from 10AM until the 11AM Memorial Service in St. Paul’s Episcopal Church, 1710 E. Superior St., Duluth, MN 55812.  Arrangements by Dougherty Funeral Home.  JoAnn will be buried later this spring in Cross Lake, MN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
JoAnn will be dearly missed, but her legacy of service, family devotion, and kindness will continue to shine through the lives she touched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The family would like to thank the staff at Diamond Willow and Essentia Hospice for the care they gave JoAnn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In lieu of flowers the family asks that you make a donation in her name to The Alzheimer’s Association or Second Harvest Northland in hopes that the community will remember her as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;

I would get pain in my neck and behind my ear on the left side. I could have prosecco and sometimes it would hurt and sometimes it wouldn't. I could have lager and it wouldn't hurt but with wine it would really, really hurt.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Additionally, Thursby found herself feeling very itchy and exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I'd been shattered for a long time,” she told the outlet. "I was unbearably tired, I would need to have a nap during the day which is not particularly normal… I complained that I was having really, really itchy skin. My legs were unbearably itchy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy News &amp;amp; Media&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hollie Thursby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-puzzler-8620185" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here!

Play now&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Thursby said she thought the fatigue was simply due to her being a busy mom with a toddler and newborn baby at home. But in January 2025, she decided to see a doctor.  However, when she mentioned her symptoms, she said doctors “blamed it on her hormones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I listened to what the GP said and obviously didn't think anything else of it,” she told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Months later, Thursby returned to her doctor after discovering a lump on her neck. They ultimately sent her for a CT scan and biopsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In October 2025, she received the “heartbreaking” diagnosis of stage 2 Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of blood cancer. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/hodgkin-lymphoma/detection-diagnosis-staging/signs-and-symptoms.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Cancer Society;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;, symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma include swollen lymph nodes, which can cause pain when drinking, fever, night sweats and feelings of lethargy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“When I spoke to the blood cancer doctor, she said she's been working for 17 years and has only seen it one other time,” Thursby said. “But pain when you drink alcohol is actually a known side effect of Hodgkin lymphoma. 'It's something about the acidity in the wine and not when you drink other alcohol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy News &amp;amp; Media&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hollie Thursby undergoing chemotherapy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In November, Thrusby, a primary school teacher, started chemotherapy to treat her cancer, which she’ll continue in the coming months. After losing her mother to a blood disorder as a child, she told the outlet she’s now worried about not being in her own children’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Not being able to look after the boys is the worst thing about it all,” she said. “I'm worried that I'm dying and that I'm going to leave them.

Usually, if you stop exposing yourself to the heat, the rash will slowly fade away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"But if you keep slow roasting yourself, it can actually cause damage to your skin and blood vessels and make that rash permanent. And in some cases, its even been linked to skin &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/cancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;A lot of people presume they'd be left with a burn rather than a rash covering their skin if exposed to a direct source of heat, but that isn't the case with toasted skin syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Dr Toni Golen, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, explained why in an &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/what-is-toasted-skin-syndrome"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; for Harvard Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"The level of heat that triggers the rash isn’t high enough to burn you, but it can dilate superficial blood vessels under the skin," she said. That’s what causes the skin to discolour over time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;For those who might have been left with the strange rash after taking their hot water bottle sessions a bit too far this winter, Dr Golen suggested cooling it for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Exposing your skin to direct heat when using items such as a hot water bottle can cause the rash (Getty Stock Image)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Lower the setting of your electric blanket or heating pad, or limit how long you use it," the doctor said. "If your laptop is the problem, place a lap desk or other buffer between it and your skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"The rash should fade over weeks. If it doesn’t, see your doctor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;As Dr Golen mentioned, it really is important to check in with your GP if this rash doesn't disappear - as it might have triggered something more sinister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Experts &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/toasted-skin-syndrome#complications"&gt;at&lt;/a&gt; Healthline have warned that exposing your skin to a heat source for long periods can sometimes 'cause more dramatic changes in your skin cells that can develop into other conditions, including cancer'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It states: "The types of cancer that are associated with toasted skin syndrome include: squamous cell carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma and cutaneous lymphoma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"While cancer isn’t a common complication of toasted skin syndrome, it’s important to talk to your healthcare provider about any skin changes you notice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;But if you want to avoid putting yourself at risk of toasted skin syndrome altogether, it sounds like simply sticking another layer on to stay warm might be your best bet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 18:25:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxPYVZrZVRDWHpTOXdoSG01VUV2T00td3VQS3ZTT3hfQUNEZy1iNkxUSG8ya1h2NXluOXBfMWgxNUdEMTJ2QWpqNk1RbXN2M3JBeVZ5YzZ3MzF1djJNcjZvcjhmY2lMbV9qMmNZM1pFbzlzZ1FPa0tyc0ZvRmYwWThGVVRlYmk0T3lQWG5VVWFqOWZVY01aejNMdk43bFpuQlM5X1dIa3d0aTJOWWV6Wm5ORA</guid></item><item><title>这个可爱的好男孩刚刚接受了罕见的挽救生命的脑部手术- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/this-adorable-good-boy-just-got-rare-life-saving-brain-surgery-2000712485</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl prose-science dark:prose-science"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A six-year-old dog named Woody has just earned a new lease on life, thanks to a rare type of brain surgery performed by veterinarians in Portland, Oregon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Surgeons at DoveLewis Animal Hospital conducted the surgery to remove a tumor in Woody’s skull. The complicated procedure took several hours to complete but was a success. And Woody has since recuperated well enough to get back to his daily walks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The post-op recovery really takes a whole lot of people to work together, and watching him very closely, and to have a [committed] owner have the team to support his post-op and have him coming back for a recheck all these are necessary components for his success of outcome,” John Du, a neurosurgeon at DoveLewis, &lt;a href="https://katu.com/news/local/dog-recovers-from-rare-complex-brain-surgery-at-portland-animal-hospital-dovelewis-dogs-veterinary-medicine"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; local media outlet KATU Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Rare and complex&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure id="attachment_2000712583" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000712583" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2000712583 size-medium" src="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2026/01/woodytumor-189x336.jpg" alt="Woodytumor" srcset="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2026/01/woodytumor-189x336.jpg 189w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2026/01/woodytumor-720x1280.jpg 720w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2026/01/woodytumor-768x1365.jpg 768w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2026/01/woodytumor-378x672.jpg 378w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2026/01/woodytumor-540x960.jpg 540w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2026/01/woodytumor-900x1600.jpg 900w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2026/01/woodytumor.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 2rem), (max-width: 1258px) calc((100vw - 3.68rem) * 2 / 3), 800px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000712583" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;© DoveLewis Veterinary Emergency &amp;amp; Specialty Hospital&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Woody’s owners first suspected something was wrong with Woody last summer when he began stumbling on stairs and hesitating before jumps. By November, doctors at DoveLewis had identified the cause: a bone tumor pressing up against his brain.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Brain surgeries are some of the hardest procedures to perform in humans, and they can be even more challenging in dogs. The brain and skull structure of a dog can vary dramatically depending on its breed, and dogs &lt;a href="https://news.cvm.ncsu.edu/nc-state-neurologist-adapts-human-laser-therapy-for-use-in-dogs-with-brain-cancer/#:~:text=Another%20challenge%20was,through%20this%20muscle.%E2%80%9D"&gt;tend&lt;/a&gt; to have thicker muscles on their head than humans do, further complicating any incisions. So the surgery that saved Woody’s life was no easy feat, according to his doctors.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The major risk we were worried about was the tumor was very close to a few major blood vessels around the skull and it took about four to six hours, I believe, in total to be removed safely,” Du told KATU.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, the procedure—which included rebuilding part of Woody’s skull with a titanium mesh—went well without any serious hitches. Woody was carefully monitored afterward but was on his feet and able to go back home by day three. Now he’s back to his old self, walking every day and playing with his brother.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Woody’s tumor isn’t completely gone, unfortunately, but his doctors say it’s a slow-growing tumor. With ongoing monitoring and care, the family is hopeful that Woody will have many more years of life left.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This isn’t the only complex canine surgery that doctors at DoveLewis have performed as of late. Last March, they successfully &lt;a href="https://www.dovelewis.org/blog/tubas-battle-brain-tumor-story-expert-care-and-family-love"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; a large brain tumor from Tuba, a 7-year-old Boxer.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;Ever notice how some older folks seem to radiate joy while others appear weighed down by their years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week at the farmers' market where I volunteer, I watched a 74-year-old vendor practically dance between the stalls, cracking jokes with customers and helping younger vendors lift heavy crates. Meanwhile, his friend, roughly the same age, sat hunched on a bench complaining about everything from the weather to his knees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes the difference? After years of observing and talking with the happiest seniors I know, I've discovered it's not about luck or genetics. The vibrant ones all share certain daily habits that keep their spirits high and their outlook fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren't complicated rituals or expensive treatments. They're simple, intentional choices anyone can make. And the best part? You don't have to wait until you're 70 to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They move their bodies every single morning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking, "Of course exercise is on this list." But here's what surprised me: the happiest seniors don't necessarily do intense workouts. They just move, consistently, first thing in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One 78-year-old I know starts each day with a 15-minute walk around her block. Rain or shine. Another does gentle stretches while his coffee brews. A third tends her garden before breakfast, bending and reaching as she checks on her tomatoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key isn't the type of movement but the timing. Morning movement sets a positive tone for the entire day. As someone who runs trails most mornings, I can vouch for this. Even on days when I only manage a quick walk, that early movement shifts my whole mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research backs this up too. Studies show that morning exercise &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166432823005090"&gt;boosts mood-regulating neurotransmitters&lt;/a&gt; for hours afterward. But more than science, it's about starting the day by honoring your body instead of ignoring it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They practice gratitude without making it a chore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to roll my eyes at gratitude practices. Seemed too woo-woo for my analytical brain. Then I started keeping an evening gratitude journal, mostly out of curiosity, and something shifted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The happiest older people I know have mastered this art. But they don't make it complicated. One gentleman tells me he thinks of three good things while brushing his teeth each night. Another writes one sentence in a notebook she keeps on her nightstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What strikes me is how specific they get. Not just "grateful for family" but "grateful for my granddaughter's giggle when she saw the butterfly today." This specificity trains the brain to notice small joys throughout the day, knowing you'll want to remember them later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They maintain real connections, not just Facebook friendships&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's something interesting: the happiest seniors I meet aren't necessarily the ones with the most friends. They're the ones who nurture a handful of deep connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 72-year-old regular at the farmers' market told me she has coffee with the same three friends every Tuesday. They've been meeting for 15 years. Another couple in their late 70s hosts a monthly potluck where the same six people always show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quality beats quantity every time. These folks pick up the phone instead of just texting. They show up in person when someone needs help. They remember birthdays and anniversaries without Facebook reminders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I helped my parents downsize recently, we found boxes of handwritten letters from friends spanning decades. That kind of connection takes effort, but it pays dividends in happiness and belonging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They learn something new without pressure to master it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 75-year-old who just started learning Spanish isn't trying to become fluent. The 71-year-old taking pottery classes isn't aiming to sell her work. They're learning for the sheer joy of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach to learning keeps the brain flexible and curious. But more importantly, it maintains that childlike wonder that makes life feel fresh instead of repetitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One woman told me she picks a new topic each month to explore through library books and YouTube videos. Last month was birds of prey. This month it's the history of jazz. She'll never be an expert in any of these areas, and that's precisely the point. The joy is in the exploration, not the destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They have a purpose beyond themselves&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every happy senior I know contributes to something larger than their own life. For some, it's volunteering. For others, it's mentoring younger people in their former profession. Many care for grandchildren or tend community gardens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My weekly volunteer shift at the farmers' market connects me with several retirees who show up religiously to help set up tents and educate customers about local produce. One 76-year-old told me, "Retirement without purpose is just waiting around. I need to know I'm still useful."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sense of purpose doesn't have to be grand. It could be as simple as being the neighbor who waters plants when others travel, or the person who organizes the building's recycling program. What matters is feeling needed and valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. They protect their sleep like gold&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The happiest older adults I know treat sleep as sacred, not negotiable. They have bedtime routines they stick to religiously. They skip late-night TV binges. They say no to evening events that would disrupt their schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One particularly vibrant 73-year-old told me she's been going to bed at 9:30 PM and waking at 5:30 AM for the past decade. "People think I'm missing out on nightlife," she laughed. "But I'm gaining energy for the life that actually matters to me."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good sleep becomes even more crucial as we age. It affects everything from mood to memory to physical recovery. The seniors who prioritize it consistently report feeling younger and more energetic than their sleep-deprived peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. They laugh at themselves regularly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice I didn't say they're always happy or positive. The healthiest seniors I know experience the full range of emotions. But they've mastered the art of not taking themselves too seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they forget someone's name, they laugh about their "senior moment" instead of panicking about cognitive decline. When they struggle with new technology, they joke about being dinosaurs rather than feeling ashamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This self-deprecating humor serves a purpose beyond entertainment. It releases tension, connects them with others, and keeps perfectionism at bay. Speaking of perfectionism, finding my old report cards while helping my parents move reminded me how exhausting it is to take yourself too seriously all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. They say no without guilt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be the most powerful habit of all. Happy seniors have earned the right to be selective with their time and energy, and they use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They decline invitations that don't excite them. They refuse to babysit when they're tired. They skip family drama they don't want to engage with. And they do it all without lengthy explanations or apologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One 70-year-old told me, "I spent 50 years saying yes to everything. Now I only say yes to what brings me joy or truly helps someone I love. Everything else gets a polite no."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't selfishness. It's self-preservation. By protecting their energy for what truly matters, they have more to give when they do say yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my father had his heart attack at 68, it shook me to my core. Watching him recover, I saw firsthand how daily habits can make the difference between merely surviving and truly thriving in our later years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beautiful thing about these eight habits? You can start them at any age. I'm in my forties and already practicing most of them. They've made me happier now, not just preparing me for a happier future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seniors who seem to have cracked the code on aging joyfully aren't lucky or special. They've simply figured out that feeling young has less to do with denying age and more to do with engaging fully with each day. They move, connect, learn, contribute, rest, laugh, and choose. Every single day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would happen if you picked just one of these habits to start tomorrow? My guess is you'd feel a little younger by next week.&lt;/p&gt;

Recordings were made through a Basler camera (acA3088-57um; BASLER) with 15-ms exposure time. Animals were imaged at 30 frames per second for 10 min unless otherwise indicated. All animals that were in the field-of-view for at least 60 s were included in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For tracking of animals on predatory assays, &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; prey were first maintained on OP50 bacteria until freshly starved, resulting in an abundance of young larvae. These plates were washed with M9, passed through two 20-µm filters, centrifuged and deposited onto the assay plate by pipetting 4 µl of worm pellet onto a 6-cm NGM unseeded plate. A copper arena (1.5 × 1.5 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) was placed in the middle of the assay plate to constrain predators in the recording field.

PharaGlow performs a three-step analysis: (1) centre of mass (CMS) tracking and collision detection; (2) linking detected objects to trajectories; and (3) extracting centreline, contour, width and other parameters of the shape to allow extracting pharyngeal pumping events. The generated files contain the position and the straightened images which are further processed to extract the behavioural measures. Post-processing was applied according to ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 19" title="Bonnard, E., Liu, J., Zjacic, N., Alvarez, L. &amp;amp; Scholz, M.

To obtain pumping traces from straightened animals, the inverted skew of intensity is calculated for each frame per animal (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-10009-x#Fig1"&gt;1c&lt;/a&gt;). This metric is sensitive to the opening of the pharyngeal lumen and pharyngeal contractions. Peaks in the resulting trace correspond to pumping events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec15"&gt;Feature engineering&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Videos of animals with labelled pharyngeal muscles were processed using PharaGlow&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 19" title="Bonnard, E., Liu, J., Zjacic, N., Alvarez, L. &amp;amp; Scholz, M.

From these basic features, we calculated two derived features. Using the CMS coordinates (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;)), velocity was calculated with a time shift of d&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; = 60 frames (2 s). To obtain a description of head motion, we calculated the angle between the movement direction of the CMS and nose tip as&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ1" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\theta =\arccos ({{\bf{v}}}_{\mathrm{CL}}{{\bf{v}}}_{\mathrm{CMS}})$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({{\bf{v}}}_{{\rm{CL}}}\)&lt;/span&gt; is the unit vector of the centreline between the 1st and 5th coordinates along the 100 equidistantly sampled points of the centreline and &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({{\bf{v}}}_{{\rm{CMS}}}\)&lt;/span&gt; is the unit vector of the CMS coordinates between two consecutive frames. To capture frequency changes in these features, we apply a wavelet transform using pywt with a gaus5 wavelet and extract the maximum frequency for each feature over time. The head angle and the skew which relates to the faster pumping motion were transformed with the following range of pseudo-frequencies (0.3–5.0 Hz). From the wavelet transformations the maximum frequency was extracted and included as a feature. Only for skew, two wavelet transforms from scale 11.2 and 3.8 were directly included additionally, which translates to pseudo-frequencies of about 1.3 and about 3.9 Hz, frequencies relevant for feeding behaviour. For velocity only one wavelet transform with the scale 18.7 was included, which translates to around 0.8 Hz. This transformation resulted in a total set of nine features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec16"&gt;Data curation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During recordings with many animals, a small subset of frames include overlapping animals. We detect and remove these instances in the data by removing frames with an area higher than 1.5 times the mean area in one recording.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec17"&gt;Manual annotation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;An expert human annotator generated labels for a subset of frames following the naming conventions for behaviour in ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 16" title="Wilecki, M., Lightfoot, J. W., Susoy, V. &amp;amp; Sommer, R. J. Predatory feeding behaviour in Pristionchus nematodes is dependent on phenotypic plasticity and induced by serotonin. J. Exp. Biol. 218, 1306–1313 (2015)." href="/articles/s41586-025-10009-x#ref-CR16" id="ref-link-section-d13039478e2576"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Using LabelStudio pumping rate and velocity data were shown, and the annotator marked sequences corresponding to ‘biting’, ‘feeding’, ‘exploration’ or ‘quiescence’. The labels were verified by playing the corresponding video of the animal. For the unlabelled recordings, we automatically set labels encoding the recording condition, namely ‘on OP50’ or ‘on &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; larvae’. For preprocessing, the original features were preprocessed and downsampled before analysis using the following pipeline implemented in sklearn. First, further lagged features were created from the base features (velocity, instantaneous pumping rate, head angle, mean pumping rate) by shifting the individual dataset by 5, 10 and 15 frames (with 30 frames per second) forward or backward in time. This allowed us to include a short history in an otherwise memory-less pipeline. Subsequently, features were averaged using a rolling window of 30 frames (1 s) and downsampled to 1 frame per second. Labels were downsampled by using the modal value within 30 frames (1 s). The first and last seconds of each recording were truncated to eliminate effects of smoothing artifacts. The data were then transformed with a Yeo–Johnson power transform to improve normality and normalized with robust scaling. The entire pipeline was fitted on the training dataset and also applied during prediction of new data. For dimensionality reduction and clustering, the preprocessed training data with &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 106 animals from WT recordings on larvae and bacteria were embedded in three dimensions using UMAP (umap module, Python), using the parameters: n_neighbors = 70, min_dist = 0, repulsion_strength = 4, negative_sample_rate = 15, disconnection_distance = 0.85, n_components = 3. The resulting embedding was clustered with HDBSCAN. The number of clusters was determined using a silhouette score. To assign human-interpretable behavioural states to the clusters, the overlap between clusters and manual labels was calculated (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-10009-x#Fig7"&gt;2c&lt;/a&gt;) and cluster labels were verified by inspecting the feature distributions within the different clusters. Finally, cluster labels were spot-checked using the video data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec18"&gt;Behavioural state classification&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behavioural feature data with cluster labels found by embedding and clustering were used to train an XGBoost Classifier on the preprocessed data. Of the 106 videos, 9 were held-out as a test set and were not used for training the classifier. These videos were selected for their similarity in label distribution compared with the training set. Bayesian optimization was used to find optimal hyperparameters for the classifier using cross-validation. Training data were split using a stratified group shuffle split, whereby each recording was constituting a group. After the best hyperparameters were found, a model was trained on the complete training data using the optimal hyperparameters. Next, the performance of the model was evaluated with the prediction of the test set in comparison with the cluster labels. For this, standard model performance metrics were calculated (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-10009-x#Fig1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-10009-x#Fig8"&gt;3a&lt;/a&gt;). Before prediction, the steps feature engineering and preprocessing are applied to the new data. To ensure reliability of the predictions, predictions with a probability of less than 50% were set to ‘None’. This threshold balances the rate of false-positive detections with the number of unlabelled frames. In our case, excepting frames at the start and end of each recording which were excluded because of filtering effects, this threshold resulted in only 1.2% of all frames classified as ‘None’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec19"&gt;Cluster validation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To validate the robustness of the identified behavioural states, the same pipeline was applied to an independent dataset, with &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 254 animals. The dataset was resampled to contain the same number of frames from worms recorded on larvae and on OP50 as the original training set.

The microscope featured a 16-mm objective and a 50-mm tube lens, resulting in a magnification of approximately ×3.1. The camera used was a Basler acA3088-57um. To compensate for the different brightness of the fluorophores, the red channel was attenuated by a neutral density filter with an optical density of 0.6. Recordings of individual predators were analysed using a similar approach to the large population recordings with an adaptation to account for the stage motion. Prey signals were extracted from the GFP channel with a 22-µm-wide circular mask, centred at the anterior end of the predator using the extracted centreline of the pharynx as a guide. Prey signals was calculated as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ2" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${\rm{Prey}}\,{\rm{signal}}=\frac{({{\rm{GFP}}}_{\text{95 percentile}}-{{\rm{GFP}}}_{\text{5 percentile}})}{{{\rm{GFP}}}_{\text{5 percentile}}}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracks were aligned to the onset of biting events, and the prey signal was normalized to the baseline, defined as 15 to 5 s before bite onset:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ3" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${\rm{\text{Prey signal}}}\,{\rm{ \% }}=\frac{({\rm{P}}{\rm{r}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{y}}\,{\rm{s}}{\rm{i}}{\rm{g}}{\rm{n}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{l}}-{\rm{B}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{s}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{i}}{\rm{n}}{\rm{e}})}{{\rm{B}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{s}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{i}}{\rm{n}}{\rm{e}}}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistics were performed using an upper-tailed paired &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test, comparing the mean prey signal (%) of 15 to 5 s before bite onset and 0 to 15 s. To investigate the ingestion of GFP-labelled body wall muscle by the predator, we analysed the signal of the green channel subtracted (background subtracted with the ‘rolling ball’ algorithm in ImageJ with a 10-px (7.4 µm) radius). A kymograph was extracted along the centreline of the pharynx using ImageJ for one exemplary video. The video was selected because the predator was stationary for a prolonged time of 30 s, whereas the focal plane clearly showed ingestion of labelled food. The linewidth of the kymograph was 6 px (4.4 µm). To detect individual ingestion events, peak detection was performed using a segment of the kymograph in the range of the metacorpus where the ingested food was most easily visible. The intensity values in this region were averaged for each time point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec21"&gt;Statistical analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the statistical analysis of the state predictions (relative time in state, mean bout duration, transition rates), and for the corpse assay, the two-tailed Mann–Whitney &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;-test was used. The statistical analysis was performed on each condition and state with its respective control. A Bonferroni correction was applied to take into account that the probability of a false-positive significant test rises with the number of compared conditions. Thus, the &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values reported here are corrected for the number of comparisons made with the respective control.

Briefly, gene-specific CRISPR RNAs were designed to target early predicted exons in all target genes and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). These were then fused to tracrRNA (IDT) at 95 °C for 5 min before cooling to room temperature and annealing. The hybridization result was coupled with purified Cas9 protein (IDT). After 5 min of incubation at room temperature, Tris-EDTA buffer was added to achieve a final concentration of 18.1 μM for single guide RNA (sgRNA) and 12.5 μM for Cas9. The mix was injected in the gonads of young adults. P0 worms were discarded 12–24 h after microinjection. After 2 days, 96 F1 progeny from P0 plates were singled out and allowed to lay eggs for 24 h.

A whole plate of non-starved worms was used for RNA extraction using a Zymo RNA mini kit (final elution volume 30 µl). To determine the copy number of &lt;i&gt;Ppa-myo-2p&lt;/i&gt;::RFP in the ultraviolet integrated transgenic line (JWL27) and relative expression of this construct, quantitative PCR (qPCR) and qPCR with reverse transcription assays were conducted. For copy number, primers were designed to amplify a part of the RFP sequence and compared with two known single-copy gene sequences, &lt;i&gt;Ppa-gpd-3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ppa-csg-1&lt;/i&gt;. As &lt;i&gt;Ppa-myo-2p&lt;/i&gt;::RFP is a transcriptional reporter, no part of the &lt;i&gt;Ppa-myo-2&lt;/i&gt; gene sequence is included in the reporter line. Therefore, to determine the relative expression of &lt;i&gt;Ppa-myo-2p::&lt;/i&gt;RFP, the expression of RFP was compared with that of the native &lt;i&gt;Ppa-myo-2&lt;/i&gt; exon gene sequence. qPCR primers specific for RFP were: forward GGAGAGGGAAAGCCTTACGAGG and reverse GAATCCCTCAGGGAAAGACTGC.

The amount of microorganisms that were transmitted between babies grew throughout the year. After four months, the babies at a nursery already shared 15–20% of their microbial species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was higher than the proportion of all the microbes that they had acquired from birth until that point from the family,” says Nicola Segata, a microbiologist at the University of Trento in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the changes in the children’s microbiomes will be due to the diet they had at the nurseries, but the study shows that the transmission of microbial strains between babies is extensive during the first year of nursery, and points to social interactions at this stage being key to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02348-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02348-3" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;building a diverse, healthy microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, adds Segata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bug transmission&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a fetus is still in the uterus, its microbiome is thought to be non-existent in healthy pregnancies&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but it starts to develop quickly after birth&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, mainly through&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02348-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02348-3" data-track-category="body text link"&gt; microbial transmission from the mother&lt;/a&gt;. Research has shown that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03804-5" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03804-5" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;people who live together start to share microbial strains&lt;/a&gt;. But, how the developing microbiota changes over the first few years of life hasn’t been well studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fill the knowledge gap, Segata and his colleagues examined the microbiomes of 43 babies with a median age of 10 months at the start of the study. They followed them before, during, and after they attended their first year of nursery in Trento, Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We enrolled babies that were meeting for the first time, on the first day of the day care,” says Segata. “This is a time window in which their gut is much more prone to acquire strains from other babies and from adults, because the immune system isn’t yet well trained.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03449-4" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00178-8/d41586-026-00178-8_50903796.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;‘Poo milkshake’ boosts the microbiome of c-section babies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team analysed faecal sample from the babies, as well as 10 nursery staff and individuals who lived in the same homes as the children: 39 mothers, 30 fathers, 7 siblings, 3 dogs and 2 cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the infants started nursery, the researchers continued to take samples every week until the Christmas break, and for some infants this continued until July. All participants had follow-up samples taken in July and a year after the start of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Microbial richness&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed extensive baby-to-baby microbiome transmission just one month after the infants started nursery, which continued to grow over the nursery year. If a baby had a sibling, they received more microbes from the sibling than they did from their parents, they tended to have a more diverse microbiota overall, and they acquired fewer bacterial strains from nursery peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also mapped transmission of individual microbial species between individuals. Segata gives an example of what happened with a strain of bacteria called &lt;i&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/i&gt;. “We have an example of a strain jumping from a mother to the infant. The baby at the day care then transmitted it to another baby, who transmitted it to both its parents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

While cholesterol-lowering medication is vital for some people, almost everyone could benefit from incorporating more of the best foods to eat for cholesterol into their meals. Making smart choices in the kitchen can go far towards reducing levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol and maintaining healthy levels of HDL (good) cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the Experts: &lt;a href="https://www.pritikin.com/martha-theran" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Martha Theran, M.S., R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Martha Theran, M.S., R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and educator at Pritikin Longevity Center; and &lt;a href="https://www.sentara.com/medicalservices/sentara-health-research-center/for-researchers/experts/talreja-deepak" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Deepak Talreja, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Deepak Talreja, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, clinical chief of cardiology for Sentara Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol is a substance that is naturally produced by the body that is necessary for creating new cells and hormones, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/-/media/Files/Health-Topics/Cholesterol/My-LDL-Cholesterol-Guide.pdf?sc_lang=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Heart Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;. But if you have too much of it in your blood—especially LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, which are a type of fat—it can lead to clogged arteries that raise your risk of blood clot, stroke, and heart attack. That said, eating the right foods is one of the easiest things you can do to prevent this from happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Studies have shown that dietary modifications—especially lowering saturated fats, avoiding trans fats, increasing soluble fiber, and including plant sterols/stanols—can significantly reduce LDL cholesterol by 5 to 30% depending on adherence and genetics,” said &lt;a href="https://www.pritikin.com/martha-theran" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Martha Theran, M.S., R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Martha Theran, M.S., R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and educator at Pritikin Longevity Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet can help manage cholesterol in two key ways: by reducing your intake of unhealthy fats and increasing your intake of certain nutrients that can help your body flush out damage that has already been done. For example: “Increasing soluble fiber binds cholesterol in the gut and removes it from the body,” explained &lt;a href="https://www.sentara.com/medicalservices/sentara-health-research-center/for-researchers/experts/talreja-deepak" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Deepak Talreja, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Deepak Talreja, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, clinical chief of cardiology for Sentara Health. Healthy fats, like those found in nuts and seeds, can raise HDL levels and balance things out by lowering triglycerides, a type of fat that also contributes to heart disease, said Dr. Talreja. Lastly, nutrients called &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/17368-phytosterols-sterols--stanols" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:phytosterols;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;phytosterols&lt;/a&gt; found in fruits and vegetables may block the absorption of bad cholesterol, he added. What's more, replacing animal proteins with plant-based ones can help you avoid cholesterol-raising proteins found in fatty cuts of main dish meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to discover the best foods experts say can help lower cholesterol naturally and improve your cardiovascular health overall, plus some ideas for how to enjoy them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Foods to eat to lower cholesterol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Oats and barley&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These grains are high in the soluble &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5810204/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fiber beta-glucan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fiber beta-glucan&lt;/a&gt;, which binds to cholesterol in the gut and removes it from the body via waste, said Theran. You can have oats for breakfast and barley for dinner, mixed into a hearty soup, suggested Dr. Talreja.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lentils and beans&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich in soluble fiber and plant-based protein, legumes help slow digestion and reduce cholesterol absorption, said Theran. Dr. Talreja added that they can also help &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65900800/foods-to-manage-blood-sugar/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stabilize blood sugar;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;stabilize blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; and are great added to salad, soups, or wraps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fatty fish&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salmon, mackerel, and sardines are high in omega-3 fatty acids, which lower triglycerides and may raise HDL cholesterol, said Theran. Dr. Talreja recommended aiming for at least two servings of fatty fish per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Nuts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuts like almonds and walnuts contain healthy unsaturated fats, fiber, and plant sterols that help lower LDL cholesterol, said Theran. Dr. Talreja said a small daily handful (around one ounce) is heart-healthy and enough to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Avocado&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avocado is rich in monounsaturated fats and fiber, which may lower LDL cholesterol without affecting HDL, Theran explained. Dr. Talreja recommended using avocado in place of butter or cheese on toast and sandwiches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Olive oil&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extra-virgin olive oil is high in heart-protective antioxidants and monounsaturated fat, which can reduce inflammation and LDL oxidation, a chemical reaction that leads to inflammation and the formation of plaque, said Theran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Apples, berries, and citrus fruits&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These fruits contain pectin, a type of soluble fiber that binds to bad cholesterol and can help carry it out of the body through the digestive tract, said Dr. Talreja. To maximize your fiber intake, eat the skin when possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Leafy greens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark leafy green veggies like spinach, kale, arugula, and Swiss chard are especially good for cholesterol because they’re low in calories, high in fiber, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6413025/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:rich in plant sterols;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;rich in plant sterols&lt;/a&gt; that block cholesterol absorption, said Theran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Soy protein&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tofu, soy milk, and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a69796886/edamame-high-protein-vegetable/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:edamame;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;edamame&lt;/a&gt; contain plant-based proteins and isoflavones, which are plant compounds that can be anti-inflammatory and modestly lower LDL cholesterol, said Theran. You can easily use tofu or tempeh as a meat substitute in stir-fries and bowls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Green tea&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green tea is rich in catechins, a type of antioxidant that helps reduce cholesterol absorption and improve lipid profiles, said Theran, as long as you don’t overdo it with sweeteners or creamers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tomatoes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomatoes are uniquely rich in lycopene, an antioxidant that may increase levels of HDL cholesterol, according to a review in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1750-3841.15833" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journal of Food Science;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Journal of Food Science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Chia seeds&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/g42488007/chia-seeds-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Chia seeds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Chia seeds&lt;/a&gt; are rich in soluble fiber, which helps trap cholesterol in the gut, aiding in its removal from the body.

Immunocompromised NSG mice were used as recipients for either subcutaneous, orthotopic or intravenous transplantation of &lt;i&gt;KP&lt;/i&gt; LUAD cell line allografts. For subcutaneous transplantation, cells were resuspended in S-MEM (Gibco, 11380-037) and mixed with Matrigel (Thermo Fisher Scientific, CB-40230C) at a 1:1 ratio. Then, 250,000 cells were implanted subcutaneously into both flanks of NSG mice. For orthotopic transplantation, sorted cells were resuspended in PBS (Gibco, 10010-023) and intratracheally administrated to NSG mice. For intravenous transplantation, 200,000 cells were resuspended in S-MEM and injected into NSG mice through the tail vein. All cell lines were continuously monitored for mycoplasma contamination. Approximately equal numbers of male and female mice were included in all experimental groups in all mouse experiments. Mice were treated in accordance with all relevant institutional and national guidelines and regulations, and mice were euthanized by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; asphyxiation, followed by intracardiac perfusion with S-MEM to clear tissues of blood when appropriate. A complete list of mice along with age, sex and age of tumour used in experiments is available (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09985-x#MOESM4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;). All animal studies were approved by the MSKCC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol 17-11-008). Sample sizes were determined based on our previous experience with similar models rather than statistical methods. We found this sufficient to detect biologically meaningful differences while minimizing animal use; experiments were randomized when feasible. Blinding was not possible as treatment effects on tumour volume were readily distinguishable between groups. Tumour burden limit was defined as a single tumour &amp;gt;2 cm in diameter, tumour volume &amp;gt;10% of body mass or multiple tumours with a cumulative volume &amp;gt;3,000 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

In these experiments, FlpO activates oncogenic KRAS(G12D), deletes &lt;i&gt;Trp53&lt;/i&gt;, and initiates expression of the GG cassette, whereas subsequent activation of CreER&lt;sup&gt;T2&lt;/sup&gt; with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) results in a switch from GG to CB (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09985-x#Fig6"&gt;1h–k&lt;/a&gt;).

A list of the sequences of crRNAs is provided in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09985-x#MOESM4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;KPfrt&lt;/i&gt; mES cells were thawed 2 days before targeting and the media were changed 1 day and 2 h before electroporation. Before electroporation, sequence-specific crRNA and universal tracrRNA were resuspended in IDTE buffer (IDT) at a concentration of 200 µM and the crRNA–tracrRNA duplex was then formed (final concentration, 44 µM) by combining an equimolar concentration of crRNA and tracrRNA and annealing at 95 °C for 5 min (followed by cooling down to room temperature at ramp rate of 0.1 °C s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). RNP complexes were formed by combining 22 pmol of crRNA–tracrRNA duplex and 22 pmol HiFi Cas9 nuclease and incubating at room temperature for 20 min. For each electroporation, 500,000 mES cells depleted of MEFs, 1 µl donor vector (3 µg µl&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), 1 µl RNP complex, 2 µl electroporation enhancer (10 µM, IDT), 16.4 µl Nucleofector P3 primary cell solution and 3.6 µl Nucleofector Supplement 1 were combined and loaded into electroporation cuvette. The ES cells were then plated onto the top of feeder MEFs and, 48 h later, the ES cells were selected with either hygromycin (Slc4a11-FSF-MCD and Hopx-FSF-MACD, 150 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) or G418 (Hipp11-FSF-GGCB, 400 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) for 1 week. Resistant clones were manually picked, expanded and validated by genotyping using the primers listed in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09985-x#MOESM4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec15"&gt;Generation of genetically engineered reporter mouse strains&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chimeric F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; mice were obtained by injecting genotype-verified mES cells into host embryos at the eight-cell stage and genotyped at 2 weeks of age.

The &lt;i&gt;KP&lt;/i&gt; LUAD cells were then co-transfected with the Slc4a11-FSF-MACD donor vector together with the U6-sgSlc4a11-EFS-Cas9 vector expressing guide RNA (ACATATGGGGAGGTATGAGC) targeting the last exon of &lt;i&gt;Slc4a11&lt;/i&gt; at a 1:1 ratio using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, L3000015). The transfected cells were selected with hygromycin (Sigma-Aldrich, 400053) at a concentration of 150 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for 2 weeks and single-cell-derived drug-resistant clones were manually picked for expansion and genotyping with the following primers (5′ KI_F1 and 5′ KI_R1; 3′ KI_F1 and 3′ KI_R1). The single-cell-derived clones were transduced with AdCMVFlpO (Iowa Viral Vector Core) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 500 to remove the frt-bGlobinpA-(PGK-Hygromycin-pA)i-frt STOP cassette. Excision of the STOP cassette was confirmed by genotyping spanning the left homology arm and mScarlet (recombined; 5′ KI_F1 and 5′ KI_R2) and by flow cytometry analysis detecting mScarlet fluorescence (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09985-x#Fig14"&gt;9c,d&lt;/a&gt;).

A rare exception to this were those Leiden clusters where a significant proportion of cells were identified as highly proliferative and were subsequently shown to have high &lt;i&gt;Mki67&lt;/i&gt; expression. These Leiden clusters were assigned a highly proliferative cell state identity. Cell state assignments can be found in the source code available at the GitHub repository above.

Once he got into his 30s, he would have &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/colon-cancer-warning-signs-never-ignore-t108646" target="_blank"&gt;precancerous growths&lt;/a&gt; — called polyps or adenomas — removed after every screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d6c37f" class="body-graf"&gt;While that certainly takes a physical toll, "there is (also) a certain level of mental stress that it takes," Heyink, 48, tells TODAY.com. "Especially as I get older, and now that my brothers have had cancer, and a young one has passed away from it, it's quite anxiety-provoking," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f971a0" class="body-graf"&gt;Explaining the risks of Lynch syndrome to his four kids, Heyink tells them it's something they can "bring to God in prayer." And while that does bring some comfort, he knows firsthand what it feels like to have to remain constantly vigilant for a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-234e1a" class="body-graf"&gt;After losing his older brother to adrenal gland cancer in 2022 and seeing his two other brothers go through cancer (stomach cancer and colon cancer), Heyink began looking deeper into ongoing Lynch syndrome research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f868cf" class="body-graf"&gt;At that point, Heyink, a police officer in Hamilton, Ontario, was the only man in his immediate family to have escaped a cancer diagnosis. He stumbled upon a preventive cancer vaccine trial for people with Lynch syndrome, and reached out to the research team to find out if he could participate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-25a615" class="body-graf"&gt;In January 2023, he made the first of many trips down to Houston to participate in the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-340e67"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="3088" data-original-width="2316"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2026-01/cancer-vaccine-lynch-syndrome-01-mh-012126-c40e34.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/cancer-vaccine-lynch-syndrome-01-mh-012126-c40e34.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2026-01/cancer-vaccine-lynch-syndrome-01-mh-012126-c40e34.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/cancer-vaccine-lynch-syndrome-01-mh-012126-c40e34.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/cancer-vaccine-lynch-syndrome-01-mh-012126-c40e34.jpg" alt="Kevin Heyink has Lynch syndrome, which increases the risk of colorectal cancer in men by up to 80%, according to MD Anderson."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Kevin Heyink has Lynch syndrome, which increases the risk of colorectal cancer in men by up to 80%, according to MD Anderson.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Kevin Heyink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-7f365d" class="body-heading"&gt;Training the Body to Eliminate Cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e1d9e5" class="body-graf"&gt;There are around 1 million carriers of Lynch syndrome worldwide, Dr. Eduardo Vilar Sanchez, one of the trial leads and professor in the department of clinical cancer prevention at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, tells TODAY.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e4aac8" class="body-graf"&gt;And while colon cancer is the main cancer that people with Lynch syndrome are predisposed to, he says, researchers now see the condition as a "pan-cancer syndrome": It also raises the risk for endometrial, ovarian, gastric and bowel cancers, as well as some brain tumors, he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-55d28e" class="body-graf"&gt;Researchers think that Lynch syndrome may be one factor in the recent increases in cancer rates among younger patients, TODAY.com explained previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5eb987" class="body-graf"&gt;Now, with some clever biology and technology, drugmaker &lt;a href="https://nouscom.com/2026/01/16/nouscom-highlights-potential-of-nous-209-to-intercept-cancer-in-lynch-syndrome-carriers-in-seminal-nature-medicine-publication/" target="_blank"&gt;Nouscom&lt;/a&gt; developed a &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05078866" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt; that can be trained to recognize certain proteins that Lynch syndrome carriers make. Using that immune response, the vaccine may be able to prevent them from developing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-002745" class="body-graf"&gt;So, how does this actually work? The cells in your body are dividing all the time. Sometimes, errors happen in our DNA when those cells divide, but normally the body has a "mismatch repair" system to correct those mistakes, Vilar Sanchez explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4557e2" class="body-graf"&gt;However, the gene that is mutated in people with Lynch syndrome is the one that's responsible for the machinery needed to correct those errors. That results in the formation of unique proteins in the bodies of people with Lynch syndrome, which may lead to the development of cancerous or precancerous tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-37dd11" class="body-graf"&gt;Using a modified and inactive version of an adenovirus (not &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/mrna-vaccine-melanoma-rcna79987" target="_blank"&gt;mRNA technology&lt;/a&gt;), the vaccine trains the body to develop an immune response to those unusual proteins, Vilar Sanchez explains. Unlike some other cancer vaccines that show promise in treating the disease, this one is designed to be &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/breast-cancer-vaccine-cleveland-clinic-launches-trial-t235952" target="_blank"&gt;purely preventive&lt;/a&gt;, he notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9ed1a6" class="body-graf"&gt;So, if someone with Lynch syndrome who has received the vaccine does develop cancer cells or pre-cancerous lesions down the line, "the immune system is already trained to recognize these proteins and eliminate the cancer cells," Vilar Sanchez says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-98c61b" class="body-graf"&gt;Heyink is one of 45 Lynch syndrome carriers who participated in a recent trial of the vaccine. Crucially, they were all healthy at the time they enrolled in the trial, and none of them had signs of cancer, which was confirmed by colonoscopies before and after the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3eef1f" class="body-graf"&gt;The results of that phase 1b/2 trial, designed primarily to assess vaccine safety, were just published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04182-9" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. Those results showed that all participants were able to safely receive the vaccine and researchers detected a sufficient immune response, which persisted for at least a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fc2deb" class="body-graf"&gt;Participants developed fewer precancerous lesions after the vaccine and no one developed advanced cancerous tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-3b000d" class="body-heading"&gt;For Heyink, the Results Have Been 'Incredible'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-90e9db" class="body-graf"&gt;In August of 2023, he had his usual screening and, “for the first time in 20 years, it came back perfectly clear,” he says. “There were no polyps or anything.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b43af5" class="body-graf"&gt;Since then, he's had two other colonoscopies that also came back clear. "That's three in a row that have come back without any pre-cancerous growths, which is just just incredible," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4c09e2" class="body-graf"&gt;There were some temporary side effects of the vaccine, which were similar to those of a &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/are-mrna-vaccines-safe-rcna223592" target="_blank"&gt;COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, Vilar Sanchez says. They included redness and soreness at the injection site, as well as a mild fever and general fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-192dbd" class="body-graf"&gt;Following his first vaccine dose, Heyink says he felt exhausted after a long day of travel. He developed a low-grade fever and felt achey the next day. But that was it, and after his next two doses in January and May of 2024, he had no noticeable side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-482911"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="865" data-original-width="649"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2026-01/cancer-vaccine-lynch-syndrome-02-mh-012126-e7f34f.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/cancer-vaccine-lynch-syndrome-02-mh-012126-e7f34f.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2026-01/cancer-vaccine-lynch-syndrome-02-mh-012126-e7f34f.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/cancer-vaccine-lynch-syndrome-02-mh-012126-e7f34f.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/cancer-vaccine-lynch-syndrome-02-mh-012126-e7f34f.jpg" alt="Heyink hopes that his participation in the clinical trial will help create a healthier future for the next generation, including his kids, nieces and nephews."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Heyink hopes that his participation in the clinical trial will help create a healthier future for the next generation, including his kids, nieces and nephews.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Kevin Heyink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-92e0b3" class="body-heading"&gt;A Rare Sense of Hope&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1a07f6" class="body-graf"&gt;It will take more trials to truly understand how effective this vaccine is and to get it approved for wider use, Vilar Sanchez says. But these results are "a message of hope that things are moving forward," he says, adding that the "the energy of the participants in this clinical trial was so refreshing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-092adc" class="body-graf"&gt;This trial was able to meet its recruiting requirements the fastest of any trial Vilar Sanchez has worked on, he says, and he was fielding emails from potential participants across the globe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b1483b" class="body-graf"&gt;"I attribute all of this to the work of God," Heyink says. "He's led me on this path, he's given me this opportunity." A Lynch syndrome diagnosis may cause anxiety, he adds, but this trial is an example of "hope on the horizon." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3079b6" class="body-graf"&gt;In particular, Heyink sees his participation in the trial as his way of paying it forward to the future, the same way his father helped by identifying Lynch syndrome in their family. And he hopes the vaccine will one day be available for his children, as well as his nieces and nephews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cae664" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;"It's really important for the next generation," he says, and it's reassuring to know "this may be an option for them, and they won't have to worry about developing cancer halfway through their lives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:11:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxNdG1HTDEtS3NmSGcyZ1ctUGd6SUFKWk8xZ09EakRFcGhwa0tvTE4wTzZvS19ubUUtTDFibTdDMG0zNHpJMjhtbGtkUEJYNWZjSk5lSUgyMnRxWmRHQnI0VUhRUXlvUHBfemFxcjVIRndURWlOSzZ5UllydkpZazFUeHkwOA</guid></item><item><title>减数分裂基因的常见变异塑造人类重组和非整倍性-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09964-2</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol class="c-article-references" data-track-component="outbound reference" data-track-context="references section"&gt;&lt;li class="c-article-references__item js-c-reading-companion-references-item" data-counter="1."&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-references__text" id="ref-CR1"&gt;Hassold, T. &amp;amp; Hunt, P.

                &lt;p&gt;A young child who lives in Northern Virginia has tested positive for measles after traveling internationally, marking the third case in the state this month, according to health officials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All three cases of measles have involved children who are ages 4 or younger; the &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/public-relations-contacts/2026-news-releases/virginia-health-officials-investigating-another-confirmed-measles-case-in-northern-region/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Virginia Department of Health&lt;/a&gt; officials clarified Tuesday that the latest case is unrelated to the one reported on Jan. 11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virginia health officials are warning that people who were around the most recently-diagnosed patient may have been exposed to the highly-contagious illness. The child visited several health care centers in Northern Virginia last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the sites where Virginia health officials said people could have been exposed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this year, two children in Northern Virginia have contracted measles as well as another child who lives in the central part of the Commonwealth, &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/measles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to the health department&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cases come amid multiple measles outbreaks in the U.S. that have put the country at risk of losing its measles-free designation, international health authorities told &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/national/2026/01/the-us-is-on-the-verge-of-losing-its-measles-elimination-status-heres-why-that-matters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, states with three or more related cases would constitute an outbreak. There have been no new outbreaks reported by the CDC this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What to do if you’ve potentially been exposed&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re concerned you may have been exposed to measles, Virginia health officials said to look into whether you’ve been vaccinated or had the illness in the past. That includes being up to date on vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virginians can&lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/immunization/request-immunization-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; request their immunization status online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not fully vaccinated and have not had measles in the past, health officials recommend you contact your health care provider or call your local health department. There are post-exposure treatments that can be used in certain scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who may have been exposed should watch for measles symptoms for 21 days, according to Virginia health officials. In the most recent case, the most likely time frame for others to get sick would be between Jan. 20 to Feb. 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should symptoms pop up, health officials said to isolate at home and call your health care provider. Those symptoms could include a runny nose, fever over 101 degrees, cough, red or watery eyes and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;

He also called 111 [the U.K.'s non-emergency medical number].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Abrahams was diagnosed with tonsillitis and prescribed antibiotics, his condition deteriorated and leg pain left him unable to move, according to the BBC. Three days before his death, Abrahams had a video consultation with an out-of-hours doctor on Jan. 20, 2023, with the medic diagnosing sciatica. Per &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sciatica/symptoms-causes/syc-20377435" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, sciatica refers to pain that travels along the path of the sciatic nerve from the buttocks and down each leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chloe Louise Harris / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Luke Abrahams&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Abrahams had a high temperature and high blood sugar levels, an ambulance crew said he didn't need to go to the hospital when his family called them 12 hours after his sciatica diagnosis. He was admitted to the hospital two days later, but died the following day, the BBC added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before his death, attempts had been made to save Abrahams by amputating his leg, ITV reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Abrahams / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Luke Abrahams with his parents and younger brother Jake&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking before the court investigation into his death, Abrahams' father, Richard, said, "It’s so frustrating — they know they could have treated him better than they did," per ITV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want justice and accountability. Someone has to be held responsible," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abrahams' mother, Julie, said, "We would just like to know where they went wrong, how they let Luke down, and for them to be honest and to show accountability, so we can properly grieve and let Luke rest in peace properly," ITV reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Abrahams / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Luke Abrahams&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Susan Jevons, head of patient safety and coroner services for East Midlands Ambulance Service, admitted during the court investigation that Abrahams should've been taken to the hospital, per the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jevons said, "If you look at Luke's presentation, it was not normal. Blood sugar and pain score warranted a transfer to [the] hospital," she said, adding, "He was an unwell man."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He'd been treated and it wasn't working. Leaving him at home wasn't going to get the treatment he required," she concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was confirmed during the court investigation that a paramedic involved had since left the ambulance service after being supervised for some time after the incident, the BBC stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Abrahams / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Luke Abrahams and his younger brother Jake&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a November 2024 article, the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yr17g5d44o" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:BBC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; noted that an investigation into Abrahams' death had been opened, but the coroner had adjourned the court hearing until May 2025 after stating he had died of "natural causes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The previous report stated that a serious incident investigation at the East Midlands Ambulance Service Trust had found that the crew failed to follow guidelines and policies before Abrahams' death, the BBC reported, adding that his symptoms should have indicated a life-threatening condition and resulted in a transfer to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation also said that the fact that Abrahams wasn't taken to the hospital meant there was a "missed opportunity" for him to get medical help, which could have prevented "deterioration," per the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Abrahams / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Luke Abrahams with his parents and younger brother Jake&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He just got on with everyone, he had a second for everyone," Abrahams' parents told the BBC of their son before Tuesday's court investigation. "He used to go out at 11 at night because his friend needed a chat. He would make time for everyone, just bringing everyone together. That was Luke," they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NHS Northamptonshire Integrated Care Board didn't immediately respond when contacted by PEOPLE for comment and additional information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An East Midlands Ambulance Service spokesperson told PEOPLE in an email, "With the [investigation] underway, and we believe currently planned to continue until Thursday, we will be waiting until the Coroner has concluded before sharing a statement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the Northampton Coroner's Office confirmed to PEOPLE that the [investigation] may conclude on Thursday, Jan. 22, or Friday, Jan. 23.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/doctors-dismissed-symptoms-tonsillitis-sciatica-days-later-he-died-from-sepsis-and-flesh-eating-disease-11889378" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:57:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE9yb1FQTFZvNGdKUFk5d3B6Wm00NE5ZeE9jNkdPYnViU2pBNXFwNHdwRjlGcjkwRjE2cmlGa0pDUEFzeGQtQXd5UVVmWmNzMmo3SWRwdzgxLVdDOWVYT0NHTkdPcnFQM3NRYUFNZkd0QkY0X1E</guid></item><item><title>埃尔塞贡多居民对蚊虫感染感到沮丧- abc7.com</title><link>https://abc7.com/post/el-segundo-residents-frustrated-mosquito-infestation/18440632/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;&lt;span class="oyrPY qlwaB AGxeB  "&gt;EL SEGUNDO, Calif.

We're just absolutely miserable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"She wears a long sleeve nightgown, the only thing out is her hands," said Richard Johnson about his wife.

So, where's it coming from?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;El Segundo Mayor Chris Pimentel said the city first noticed an uptick in mosquitos mid-December, but tracking down the different sources has been an ongoing battle. He says while some progress has been made, the far western part of the city, near the Hyperion Water Treatment Plant, continues to see an influx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The water treatment plant, I mean they're dealing with 240 million gallons of water every day, so there's a lot of liquid there," said Pimentel. "So, we identified some standing places there, dewatered it, treated it, there's chemistry in there. We went up and down the greenbelt and basically removed and drained as much water as we could there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Mayor Pimentel says he also lives in the area seeing an influx and after months of testing, there's been no sign of mosquito-borne disease.

They’re high in sodium, saturated fat and chemical preservatives, all of which damage the lining of blood vessels,” Dr. Jean says, explaining that excess sodium raises blood pressure, while saturated fat increases LDL “bad” cholesterol, which promotes plaque buildup inside the arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/habit-that-ages-heart-faster-than-smoking-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This Common Daily Habit Ages Your Heart Faster Than Smoking;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;This Common Daily Habit Ages Your Heart Faster Than Smoking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, Dr. Jean says that the combination of high blood pressure and plaque buildup leads to &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/how-to-reduce-inflammation" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and stiffening of the arteries, which can then lead to a &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/commonly-missed-early-heart-attack-sign-cardiologist" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart attack;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/silent-stroke-symptoms-according-to-neurologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stroke;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of all this, she warns that the chemicals used to preserve deli meats can increase inflammation and make it harder for the body to control blood sugar, which puts extra strain on the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/foods-cardiologists-always-eat-for-heart-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:7 Foods Cardiologists Always Eat for Heart Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;7 Foods Cardiologists Always Eat for Heart Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s also strong evidence that people who eat a lot of processed meats have a higher risk of dying from heart disease. In my own practice, I frequently see patients who think they’re eating fairly healthy, but don’t realize that regularly eating deli meat can quietly undermine their heart health,” she tells &lt;em&gt;Parade&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To this point, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3680013/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to a study published in BMC Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;according to a study published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that took into account 448,568 participants in 10 different countries, a diet that includes processed meat increases the risk of cardiovascular disease by 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What To Eat Instead&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the science is clear that regularly eating processed deli meat is bad for cardiovascular health, it doesn’t have to mean never enjoying a sandwich again. “You don’t have to give up sandwiches; you just need better proteins,” Dr. Jean says. She recommends swapping deli meat for grilled or roasted chicken or &lt;a href="https://parade.com/236361/smccook/how-long-to-cook-the-perfect-turkey-and-how-to-know-when-a-turkey-is-done/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:turkey;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;turkey&lt;/a&gt;, fish like tuna or salmon, &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1377719/parade/hummus-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hummus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hummus&lt;/a&gt; with vegetables, beans, lentils or tofu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to make your sandwich even more heart-healthy? Dr. Jean suggests making it with whole grain bread, lots of vegetables and healthy fats like &lt;a href="https://parade.com/food/best-olive-oil-brands" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:olive oil;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;olive oil&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1115442/parade/avocado-recipes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:avocado;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;avocado&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike a sandwich with deli meat, a sandwich with these ingredients will support your arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/more-important-heart-health-lowering-dietary-cholesterol-saturated-fat-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:What's More Important for Heart Health: Dietary Cholesterol or Saturated Fat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;What's More Important for Heart Health: Dietary Cholesterol or Saturated Fat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because whole grains and vegetables contain fiber, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11819994/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:which reduces inflammation and lowers cholesterol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;which reduces inflammation and lowers cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;.

Dr. Jean says that’s okay! It’s fine to have deli meat every once in a while when a craving hits; you just don’t want it to be a regular meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not about being perfect. It’s about frequency,” she stresses. “Replacing processed meats with whole, minimally processed foods even a few days a week can lower blood pressure, improve cholesterol, reduce inflammation and meaningfully lower heart-attack risk. Small, consistent changes add up to big protection for the heart.” Those are words to live by—literally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/best-high-protein-snack-for-heart-health-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: This Is the #1 Best High-Protein Snack for Heart Health, According to Cardiologists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Related: This Is the #1 Best High-Protein Snack for Heart Health, According to Cardiologists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sources:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22896-arteries" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Arteries.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Arteries.&lt;/a&gt; Cleveland Clinic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/high-blood-pressure" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:What Is High Blood Pressure?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;What Is High Blood Pressure?&lt;/a&gt; National Institutes of Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diab, A., Dastmalchi, L.N., Gulati, M., et al.

Now, a large-scale study suggests that strength-training adds years to life. Here, discover what the study found, plus how strength-training may extend your life and some expert-backed tips on incorporating it into your fitness routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-milica-mcdowell/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Milica McDowell, D.P.T.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Milica McDowell, D.P.T.&lt;/a&gt;, the assistant vice president of education at U.S. Physical Therapy; Tami Smith, C.P.T., certified personal trainer and founder of &lt;a href="https://fithealthymacros.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fit Healthy Macros;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Fit Healthy Macros&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-7737/13/11/883" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Biology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Biology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; took a closer look at the impact of weight training on aging in nearly 5,000 people between 20 and 69 years old. Researchers measured the length of each of the participant's telomeres (protective DNA caps at the ends of chromosomes). &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3370421/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Telomeres;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Telomeres&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shorten at a consistent rate as you get older, so they wanted to see if people who strength-trained regularly had longer telomeres than those who did not. To do so, participants were asked how often they worked out, including how often they did strength-training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that participants who reported the most time spent strength training had significantly longer telomeres than those in the no strength-training category. More specifically, they found that strength-training for 90 minutes a week was linked with almost four years less biological aging. That is, potentially extending their lives by nearly four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strength training is defined as any movement against a resistance that helps your muscles get stronger, said &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-milica-mcdowell/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Milica McDowell, D.P.T.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Milica McDowell, D.P.T.&lt;/a&gt;, the assistant vice president of education at U.S. Physical Therapy. “Unlike endurance or mobility training, which help your muscles contract more frequently over a period of time, or have greater flexibility, strength training is a very specific type of training that is focused on how much force you can generate,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how can building your muscles lead to a longer life? Strength training helps reduce cardiovascular disease and death risks as it reduces your blood pressure, resting heart rate (over time), and stress levels, said McDowell. “It can help with &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/a43122348/weight-training-for-weight-loss/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:weight loss;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;weight loss&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and body composition management, also factors that contribute to reducing disease and death risk,” she said. Strength training also improves your stamina and balance to reduce your risk of falls and counteract the effects of a sedentary lifestyle, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This type of exercise may also help extend your life by &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a44284752/physical-activity-bone-density-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protecting your bones;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;protecting your bones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, joints, and ligaments from injuries that can often be life-threatening as we age, said Tami Smith, C.P.T., certified personal trainer and founder of &lt;a href="https://fithealthymacros.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fit Healthy Macros;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Fit Healthy Macros&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “It also can help combat chronic disease and improve your mental wellbeing,” she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other benefits, according to the study, include reducing muscle loss, increasing resting metabolic rate, reducing body fat, and decreasing oxidative stress, all of which may “limit disease and slow the aging of cells.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to add more strength training to your routine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this study align with the current exercise guidelines in the U.S. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/adding-adults/index.html#:~:text=Each%20week%20adults%20need%20150,day%2C%205%20days%20a%20week." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recommends two strength workouts per week for adults, said McDowell. “This could be as simple as a bodyweight routine to get your heart rate up a little and those muscles working,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before you purchase a set of dumbbells, beginners should focus on short duration (under 20 minutes) and total body workouts, with general exercises, McDowell said. Bodyweight exercises like squats, planks, and triceps dips are ideal &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/workouts/g69656476/strength-training-exercises-women-over-50/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:strength training exercises for people over 50;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;strength training exercises for people over 50&lt;/a&gt; to get you started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal should be to focus on your form and aim to perfect it before picking up weights and adding resistance to your routine, Smith agreed. “With time and consistency, you will get stronger and be able to incorporate heavier weights and additional exercises,” she said. Smith recommended starting with two to three strength-training sessions per week, spending 15-20 minutes on each session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a strength class or scheduling a session with a personal trainer is also a great way to get comfortable with weights and learn proper form, said McDowell. “If you are a beginner, many gyms will have a beginning or foundations strength class where you can learn principles under the watchful eye of a coach who can ensure you do the movements correctly,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research shows that everyone should be adding some form of strength training to their fitness routine to promote longevity and overall health. “Strength training not only adds years to your life, but it also improves the quality of those years,” Smith said. Plus, adding strength training to your routine could mean the difference between being able to walk around freely and independently as we age versus relying on the assistance of others for our activities of daily living, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:20:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxOT0MyU0p2S0RXb0J1bDV5WHhuZTdZczRLLU5sNzFqa1Q1WVFKdWtSSDQteFhDMnRYRkVveUpJa2dTOHplSHUzVFlSZVlOUXJ6b0JLMUpZTm9TVWNsU29KUkV2ajVvQXRqT0o4aFBLcUV1aTRiRzg4Q181TXduTVZELTlCLXg</guid></item><item><title>苹果醋对您的健康有什么好处？营养学家解释- marthastewart.com</title><link>https://www.marthastewart.com/benefits-apple-cider-vinegar-11889246</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="marthastewart-sc-page_1-0" class="comp marthastewart-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you follow health trends on social media, you've likely heard all about the benefits of apple cider vinegar.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a result, apple cider vinegar has earned a robust reputation as a popular health food, particularly for gut and digestive health. So much so that it can be found in products like canned or bottled drinks, powders, and gummy or capsule supplements. But on its own, does apple cider vinegar have any advantages for overall wellness, and is it just as good as other fermented foods? To find out, we asked registered dietitians to share insights on the trendy liquid and how it can realistically impact your health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The fermentation process required to make apple cider vinegar involves two steps, according to Elizabeth DeRobertis, MS, RD, CDN, CDE, CPT, registered dietitian and director of the nutrition program at Scarsdale Medical Group, White Plains Hospital. First, yeast turns the sugar in apple cider into alcohol, then bacteria turn that alcohol into acetic acid, the main component of vinegar.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; During the second step, probiotics (i.e., "good" bacteria) begin to grow—but not all apple cider vinegars have these properties, she notes. "Raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar has good bacteria, [but] filtered or pasteurized apple cider vinegar is heated, which kills off probiotics," says DeRobertis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-apple-cider-vinegar-benefits"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Apple Cider Vinegar Benefits &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before exploring the potential health benefits of apple cider vinegar, it's worth noting that it’s usually consumed in small amounts. That’s because it's commonly used as a flavoring ingredient rather than as a drink itself. (In fact, consuming too much apple cider vinegar at once can irritate the teeth, throat, and stomach, as it’s highly acidic.) With that in mind, apple cider vinegar isn't a magical solution, says DeRobertis. But it may have modest benefits, including:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Improve Cholesterol Levels &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High cholesterol levels can increase the risk of heart disease, but some foods—including apple cider vinegar—could lend a hand. "Some small studies suggest that apple cider vinegar may modestly improve cholesterol levels," says Lauri Wright, PhD, RDN, LD/N, FADA, registered dietitian nutritionist, associate professor, and director of nutrition programs at the University of South Florida. This includes lowering total cholesterol and LDL ("bad") cholesterol and raising HDL ("good") cholesterol. “These benefits are thought to be linked to acetic acid, the main active compound in vinegar, which may help reduce fat production in the liver,” per Wright.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The catch? Most of these studies have been small or involved animals, so larger human trials are needed before ACV can be recommended as a cholesterol-lowering treatment, says Wright.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Reduce Oxidative Stress &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Apple cider vinegar contains antioxidants like polyphenols, particularly from the apples used in its production," says Wright. Polyphenols are plant compounds that help combat oxidative stress (i.e., cell damage) in the body, potentially lowering the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer. And while apple cider vinegar isn’t a major source of these &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/best-antioxidant-fruits-11736165" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;—especially when compared to fruits and vegetables—it might still provide a small boost, says Wright.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Support Gut Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As apple cider vinegar ferments, it produces "the mother," a cloudy growth that contains probiotics, says Wright. "Probiotics support gut health by helping maintain a balanced microbiome, which is important for digestion, immune function, and mood regulation," she adds.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, since apple cider vinegar is typically consumed in small amounts, it's not considered one of the top fermented foods for gut health, explains Wright. "Other fermented foods like yogurt with live cultures, kefir, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/how-to-eat-sauerkraut-11715256" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;sauerkraut&lt;/a&gt;, kimchi, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/what-is-miso-8769132" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;miso&lt;/a&gt; contain a much higher and more diverse probiotic content," says Wright. They can also be enjoyed in larger portions, making them more effective in supporting a healthy gut microbiome, she notes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Control Blood Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you eat carbohydrates (think bread, rice, pasta, or fruit) your body breaks down these foods into sugar, explains DeRobertis. The sugar enters your bloodstream, prompting the pancreas to produce insulin, a hormone that moves sugar out of the blood and into the cells for energy. For some people, particularly those who are insulin-resistant, sugar may remain in the bloodstream longer, potentially causing high blood sugar, says DeRobertis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In these individuals, it's thought that apple cider vinegar may help reduce blood sugar by slowing down digestion or the breakdown of carbs. However, there's currently no solid evidence for this effect, so more research is needed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Improve Fullness &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The potential for apple cider vinegar to slow digestion may also help you feel fuller for longer, says DeRobertis. That's because slowing digestion also reduces how quickly sugar enters the blood, thereby stabilizing blood sugar and preventing energy crashes. Additionally, there's some evidence that acetic acid—which is found in vinegar, including apple cider vinegar—can stimulate a hormone that promotes fullness, but more studies are needed on this, says DeRobertis.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As mentioned, apple cider vinegar is highly acidic, so it can "irritate the throat, erode tooth enamel, and upset the stomach if taken straight," says Wright. Thus, the vinegar should always be diluted in other ingredients or used in recipes for a tastier experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In water: &lt;/strong&gt;A common way to consume apple cider vinegar is to dilute one to two tablespoons in eight to 10 ounces of water, shares Wright. You can also try it in tea, seltzer, lemonade, or apple cider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire-cider tonic:&lt;/strong&gt; To give your apple cider vinegar a boost, infuse it with anti-inflammatory herbs, spices, honey, and vegetables. The resulting &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/1513793/test-kitchens-favorite-fire-cider-tonic" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fire-cider tonic&lt;/a&gt; can be mixed in liquid, just like regular apple cider vinegar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salad dressings: &lt;/strong&gt;Whip up a &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/336993/basic-vinaigrette" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;basic vinaigrette&lt;/a&gt; with apple cider vinegar, then toss with greens or drizzle over roasted vegetables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoothies: &lt;/strong&gt;If you enjoy the combination of tangy-sweet flavors, add a splash of apple cider vinegar to your next smoothie. Sweet ingredients like bananas, berries, honey, or dates can help balance the tanginess of the vinegar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marinades: &lt;/strong&gt;When used in marinades, acidic ingredients—including apple cider vinegar—can help soften meats. It can also be used in place of other acids (like lemon juice) in your favorite&lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/steak-marinade-recipes-7693356" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt; marinade recipe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

He remembers one particular evening walk that he took with his father, Phil, as they weathered out those early months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As they strode through the neighborhood, Nadel, now 26, said that the prospect of a vaccine was exciting, but the idea of pharmaceutical executives profiting off a devastating virus left him feeling uneasy. Phil grew concerned by the complex ethical predicament that his son laid out, and Nadel could quickly tell that his father was acting strangely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I think I have to tell you something,” Phil said mid-walk, before explaining that in the early days of the HIV/Aids epidemic he had invested in what are known as, “viatical settlements”. Phil would buy the life insurance policies of people dying of Aids, often with just weeks or months to live, for a portion of the plan’s value in cash. For many, it afforded them the ability to pay for food, rent and hospital bills as debilitating illness left them unable to work. For others, it was their chance to blow the funds on travel or experiences with the limited time they had left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="1dfa0726-0579-4076-b8fe-6ecdcbe3acdf" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":3,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"AI, Salman Rushdie and Elon Musk: the most anticipated documentaries of 2026","elementId":"1dfa0726-0579-4076-b8fe-6ecdcbe3acdf","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2026/jan/09/documentaries-coming-out-this-year"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":3},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I was thrown for a total loop,” Nadel told the Guardian. “He had been part of this industry, and that the profits he made from it had helped to bankroll my childhood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For Nadel, a gay film-maker, it sent him into a “spiral” that did not begin with the desire to make a movie. “I understand myself as somebody who stands on the shoulders of Aids activists who use their bodies to create a world in which I can be healthy and take my PrEP [pre-exposure prophylaxis] every morning, and also in which I can be relatively free as a gay man,” he said. “So many of the advances in gay rights came from the visibility of the Aids era, and here I was learning that my existence and privilege was hinged in some way on those same people dying.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="fad95cd5-eb3a-4f8b-b200-85ed6c922f76" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.VideoYoutubeBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As he began investigating the muddied history of viatical settlements throughout the peak of the Aids crisis, the outlines of a film started to emerge. The result is Nadel’s Oscar-shortlisted documentary short, Cashing Out, which tells the story of how a cottage industry of buying up life insurance policies was both ghoulish and liberating in equal measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One of the film’s main characters, Scott Page, inadvertently configured an early viatical settlement when his partner, Greg, who was living with Aids, became progressively sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Short on cash, but armed with a robust life insurance policy, Page ran an advertisement in a local paper to see if someone could buy Greg’s plan in exchange for an advance. When a private investor reached out, the couple struck up a “loose agreement” that allowed Greg to live out the time he had left with some financial security. The payout meant they could also move into a house and get a golden retriever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As dozens of old pictures flash across the screen, you see an idyllic slideshow of two people with a rich life: fixing up their home, lying by the beach and laughing with friends. But it’s also a bittersweet record of Greg’s final months. Page ultimately remembers how the money in-hand was “absolutely transformative” for his late boyfriend, as he “saw the stress leave his body”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The absurdity of getting a cash advance on your death, however, wasn’t lost on Page. When he saw the peace and freedom it gave Greg before he died, he turned his energy into becoming a viatical broker for scores of other gay men – often without loved ones by their bedside – who were dying of an illness that much of the federal government had shrouded in shame and prejudice. When Page started to approach banks and credit unions about getting involved in the investment scheme, they were incredulous and insisted that payouts should be for the families of the deceased. For Page, their arguments weren’t rooted in reality. “These people’s families have walked away from them,” he recalls in the documentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It meant that private individuals made up most of the initial investor network when it came to buying up policies. They were provided a morbid ledger. On one side, the value of a policy and the dollar amount needed to buy it outright, on the other, the T-cell count of a person living with HIV/Aids and their life expectancy. Often, it served as an assurance that a payout was inevitable. The sicker the policyholder, the quicker the windfall for the investor. Soon, institutions realized that these small-time individual investors were making a lot of money, and changed their tune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nadel constructs his documentary like a deeply reported magazine story: gripping anecdotes, a rich – albeit macabre – historical backdrop, and varied voices who show that while some people benefited from viatical settlements, there were so many who were left out of the conversation altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;DeeDee Chamblee, a trailblazing advocate and activist reminds us that for Black trans women living with Aids – who often didn’t have jobs that provided life insurance policies – a viatical settlement was something they could only dream about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="e291937c-773f-4d00-9857-5c84610327ca" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;A still from Cashing Out.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: New Yorker&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One of the most harrowing moments of the documentary comes when Chamblee remembers suffering through her illness, with only three T-cells left, and how she would fantasize about getting a payout to live out her final days in peace. “I could go to the beach, and I could stay there until this thing is through,” she reminisces. “That was not a reality at all,” she adds, expecting to end up buried in a wooden box in a “potter’s field” with other unclaimed bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Chamblee’s testimony is a jolting reminder that her experience living with Aids is a world away from the white, gay men who had policies to sell. In making Cashing Out, Nadel realized the most marginalized, particularly trans sex workers of color, aren’t “afforded a shred of basic dignity when their death is imminent”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But by the late 1990s, significant developments in antiretroviral therapy meant that HIV-positive people started living longer, defying the odds and outliving the predictions that viatical investors were initially promised. “It was going great, until people didn’t die all the time,” Page says, with a glint of karmic joy in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Eventually, those betting on death stopped cashing in so easily. Instead, they found themselves stuck paying premiums on policies that would never pay out. “I think they banked on that not being an urgent enough question for our world to answer,” Nadel said. “Then they were angered when the activists from Act Up successfully pushed the government to develop and release drugs quickly … anybody who invested their whole retirement in viaticals was making a really bad investment decision, and that is no one’s fault but their own.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nadel filmed interviews with his subjects – Page, Chamblee and Sean Strub, a long‑term survivor who founded POZ magazine – over the course of a year. Their unfiltered honesty ultimately prompted him to fold in the story of his own father’s investment in viatical settlements. “I just felt like they were submitting themselves so fully to the process,” he said. “And so for me to have a secret about my relationship with this, that I was keeping from the audience, just felt wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a recent interview, Nadel said that while his thesis for the film had shifted over time, it now seemed straightforward. “This helped a lot of people, but I’m disgusted that it had to exist,” he said. Modern‑day precarity in accessing healthcare in the US – from the expiration of Covid‑era Obamacare subsidies to the substantial cuts to Medicaid funding projected over the next decade – means Cashing Out can serve as both a historically specific and evergreen indictment of the country’s tenuous social safety net, Nadel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“When the government refuses to fulfil its role in taking care of us, we have to come together and find creative ways to take care of each other,” he said. “Illness does not discriminate … so I want to encourage people who watch the film to find their strange bedfellows in the fight for survival.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 14:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxQWlk2V1MwMXZaUGxrdmZoMGNJanJ3eXNydkx0TV9xMVotekFwRl9Pbk5URjVPeW91b2lGcmdGanFVTUo2dF9sVXdhdnZQRHRUR1BKTEVUSkVHVHhhNHhhNWhUcmlfeTBUa0M2Qm82QVEtUGRBUnpoNWlmclBjNzBPdVh6VG10TVdOUVRTMXRUMDBod3Jwcndz</guid></item><item><title>如何增强您的免疫系统-您当地的流行病学家</title><link>https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/how-to-strengthen-your-immune-system</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Your Local Epidemiologist</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 14:36:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQdW5Xc3VZQ3ZMZVBKZVVWOHdRbG9meWYxbEtxTmxJTUdHRlM5YnZfTzViMjFPX2xqdjVraEI3UTF1QnQwMWRDWDBzaXA1VEhwRjZGN1ZQbXhjR0FmSEFLanF5RW9qeHo0NEhmODRKUzhlOFo3Z3ZpcUx0dDBfOW11VE1xbVFiS3BpZXhv</guid></item><item><title>为什么女孩未被诊断出多动症-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00098-7</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="js-context-bar-sticky-point-mobile" data-track-context="article body"&gt;

Julia Schechter, a clinical psychologist at the Duke Center for Girls &amp;amp; Women with ADHD in Durham, North Carolina, explains why girls with ADHD are harder to diagnose, and how undiagnosed girls face higher risks of bad outcomes than boys do, ranging from relationship issues to eating disorders and self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the current rates of ADHD diagnosis in women and girls?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past couple of years, there has been a rise in the number of women who have requested assessment and been diagnosed with ADHD. This means that the diagnosis rate in adult women is about the same as in men. However, there is a big discrepancy in diagnosis rates in children. The ratio differs depending on the study, but there are at least two to three times as many boys diagnosed with ADHD as girls&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/collections/eiafijbgch" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00098-7/d41586-026-00098-7_51957760.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Nature Outlook: ADHD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why are girls underdiagnosed?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In girls and women, ADHD tends to show up as inattentiveness — that is, difficulty remaining focused on a task, getting easily distracted or having trouble with organizing. Boys and men with ADHD, by contrast, characteristically display hyperactivity and impulsivity: they often fidget and have trouble staying seated. Girls can also have these symptoms, although they are less commonly reported. The latest research suggests that hyperactive behaviours in girls can show up as hyper-verbal tendencies, such as being excessively talkative&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also suspect that girls mask or downplay their symptoms. It might be that they have internal restlessness and a drive to be physically active, but that strong social pressures in the environment and in society more generally lead them to work extra hard to tamp them down. So, because their symptoms are less obvious or familiar to others, girls tend to not meet the diagnostic criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do we need better diagnostic criteria?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we look at the studies that helped to inform the diagnostic criteria, most of the participants were male. This is problematic, because we cannot get a complete picture of the range of symptoms we might see across the sexes. We need more science to better understand how these symptoms present in everyone. The problem is circular. For example, researchers say that we need to study more girls. However, it can be difficult to enrol girls with ADHD in studies because they are diagnosed less often and are harder to find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Girls with ADHD also tend to have more psychiatric conditions than girls without ADHD do. And when we compare them with boys who have ADHD, girls are more likely to have conditions such as depression and anxiety. This makes it harder to discern what is and is not ADHD. It also affects who’s involved in research. In an effort to isolate ADHD symptoms for study, some researchers screen out girls, or anyone, with these co-occurring conditions. We need to better study these girls so that we can potentially consider different diagnostic criteria. In the meantime, we need to work out how to use the criteria we have to broaden our understanding of how these symptoms show up in girls, and how this can impair their functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the risks of undiagnosed ADHD?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Untreated, unmanaged ADHD for anybody can be problematic, but there are many unique risks for girls and women compared with those without ADHD. They are much more likely than boys and men to experience social difficulties, such as bullying. They are at higher risk of relationship problems, including violence from an intimate partner. They are six times more likely to experience a teenage pregnancy, and are twice as likely to engage in self-harm. There are data showing higher rates of eating disorders, and higher rates of both suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. People of both sexes with ADHD are more likely to die prematurely, but that tendency is slightly more pronounced in women than in men&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can we provide better treatment?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short answer is more funding for science and research to explore this question, along with better access to diagnostic tools. Some tools for evaluating ADHD allow care providers to compare scores from their female patients with other female-specific data. But these tools are often proprietary, expensive and not available in primary-care offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also need to increase awareness. When a girl presents with anxiety, it is important to assess that, but health-care providers could also consider an ADHD assessment, because we know that they often come together. Even when girls are diagnosed, they are much less likely than boys to receive ADHD medication, even though these treatments are currently thought to be just as effective in girls and women. We’re not sure why there is this prescribing pattern. It might be that girls’ ADHD symptoms are often less overtly disruptive than those in boys, that providers have biases against ADHD medications for girls, or that co-occurring conditions such as anxiety overshadow the ADHD treatment. We’re still working this out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need a better understanding of how medications are working in girls and women, and whether there might be particular psychosocial and behavioural interventions that could be tailored for their unique experiences. For example, girls could be better able to manage their ADHD if they are tracking the connection between symptoms and hormonal fluctuations. We could also look at management strategies that account for both ADHD and co-occurring symptoms, such as anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

How’s your neck feeling?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The way we sit, scroll and work means we often hold static positions for too long, creating tension and stiffness that radiates through the upper body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts say we can change how we move to counteract the strain and protect your neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="take-micro-breaks-to-reset" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Take ‘micro breaks’ to reset&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you work at a desk, aim to break up sitting every 30 to 45 minutes, says Dr Rocco Cavaleri, senior lecturer in physiotherapy at Western Sydney University. Simply standing up for 60 to 90 seconds is enough to reset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Regular ‘active breaks’ can reduce neck and back discomfort and reduce office stress,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While you are standing, he suggests taking a few deep breaths while rolling your shoulders back. Gently turn your head from side to side.

Try adding a quick 30-60 second walk during these breaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="vary-your-tasks" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Vary your tasks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Do not ignore your body’s signals, if you feel tension or discomfort, take it as a cue to move,” says Dr Poonam Mehta, senior lecturer in physiotherapy at the University of Technology in Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you can’t move away from what you’re doing, try varying your tasks every hour, says Dr Peter Stubbs, physiotherapist and lecturer at University of Technology Sydney. So, if you have been typing for an hour, switch to a task that doesn’t require a screen – like a phone call or make a cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="bring-the-device-to-you" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Bring the device to you&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Tame tech neck” by bringing your screen closer to eye level, Cavaleri says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He says small habits, like using a laptop riser or propping your phone on a stand, can significantly reduce the load on your neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Treleaven agrees, suggesting you check that elbows and knees are at 90 degrees, screen at eye height, with keyboard and mouse close. If you use dual screens, ensure they are at the correct height and position with the main screen directly in front to avoid being in a twisted position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;You can also occasionally move your monitor slightly to the left or right, which forces your neck to rotate gently and prevents getting “stuck” in a fixed gaze, Stubbs says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="6d17c518-7bb1-42b9-9eb8-0023f83d7b05" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘Tame tech neck’ by bringing your screen closer to eye level, says Dr Rocco Cavaleri, a senior lecturer in physiotherapy.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="gentle-stretches" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Gentle stretches&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Don’t crack your neck, do strong stretches or repetitive self manipulating,” Treleaven says. While this may feel good temporarily, it is risky and doesn’t help, Stubbs says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead, the experts recommend gentle mobility exercises a few times a day, even while sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Treleaven suggests a move called the “bow and arrow”. To do it, sit with arms extended in front of you, palms touching. Slide one hand back along your other arm, pulling your elbow back as if drawing a bowstring. Let your head follow the moving elbow, rotating gently to look behind you. Slowly reverse the motion to the start and repeat on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Stubbs recommends exercises with a small range of motion and no jerky movements such as slow, controlled neck nods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Other effective micro-stretches he suggests are side rotations (keep your shoulders still and slowly turn your head to look over your left shoulder, then slowly to your right) and the ear-to-shoulder, in which you drop your ear down towards your shoulder without lifting your shoulder up to meet your ear. Aim for up to 30 repetitions, if comfortable, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="move-it" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Move it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cavaleri says regular exercise improves neck and overall musculoskeletal health. He suggests choosing walking meetings, taking the stairs, a brisk walk at lunch, or cycling to and from work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Accumulating 30-60 minutes of moderate activity most days is a good goal, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Stubbs adds that even if you have mild pain, keep up gentle movements so your neck does not freeze up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="check-your-stress-and-sleep" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Check your stress and sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“People carry stress in their neck,” Treleaven says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="4952b70f-2f05-41bd-aaf7-29f0857cf212" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":31,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"‘We stick them in shoes and forget about them’: how to really look after your feet","elementId":"4952b70f-2f05-41bd-aaf7-29f0857cf212","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2026/jan/18/we-stick-them-in-shoes-and-forget-about-them-how-to-really-look-after-your-feet"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Stubbs says a significant part of neck pain comes from unconscious muscle tensing, particularly in the trapezius – a pair of large triangular muscles extending over the back of the neck and shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He suggests taking a moment of mindfulness during your breaks. Ask yourself: “Am I tensing my shoulders?” then consciously drop them and relax your jaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cavaleri says managing stress and sleep is key. Routines like a short wind-down stretch before bed, breathing exercises or a walk helps lower muscle tension and improve sleep quality, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sleep posture also matters, says Mehta, who recommends keeping your neck supported and in a neutral, comfortable position to help prevent unnecessary strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPTE1EZDNaNmxBM25hN3NXd3Yzb2N4QXRfbXp4X01GLW9BeU0yc2FwUS1fbjNXTkNOeUc5WDlES2tuMFJJQ2pabkk3Z011N1lnQjd0MTV0U2k3dzJ0SVFlWnJEQU4yZ1hxZXhJVzczVkRXa0RGck9jMnp1dzlUWVA3RUQ4QlVfVFRQZVc5U3EzR3hSVGhNSmwwc0FkUGs</guid></item><item><title>OHSU研究人员确定了脑部疾病背后的关键触发因素，通常被误认为是精神疾病- oregonlive.com</title><link>https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2026/01/ohsu-researchers-identify-key-trigger-behind-brain-disorder-often-mistaken-for-mental-illness.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QTLIUEJBLRDIZITNEYIWW5UBUU"&gt;Some serious brain disorders begin with symptoms that are easy to misinterpret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="67F2LOAQQNBBLP67N4GDYNTEDE"&gt;A person may become confused, forgetful or paranoid and be treated for mental illness before doctors realize the underlying problem isn’t psychological at all. Instead, the body’s immune system — meant to fight infection — is attacking the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MD6JR6SUKBBDPGTB3CQB6C6EXA"&gt;Researchers at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University say they have identified, in new detail, how that attack happens. Their findings, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aeb4249" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;published last week in Science Advances&lt;/a&gt;, could lead to more precise treatments and earlier diagnosis of an autoimmune condition known as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4H3Q33RSI5EKFG5UXEYACFJGVE"&gt;The disease affects roughly one in a million people each year and often strikes young adults. It occurs when the immune system produces antibodies — proteins designed to fight disease — that mistakenly latch onto something called an NMDA receptor, which helps brain cells communicate and plays a key role in memory, learning and normal thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TDYS7WGLKFCZNPTUK24GH7NPZQ"&gt;Scientists have long known antibodies were involved but did not fully understand where they attached or why current treatments don’t always work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KJQD7POOY5D2LHP47VVIJJS2DQ"&gt;“What we wanted to understand was where on the receptor the antibodies actually bind,” said co-author Dr. Gary Westbrook, a neurologist and senior scientist at OHSU’s Vollum institute. “That’s important because it provides a clue to how one could design more specific treatments to deal with the disorder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RO35IHVB5JC6VKNGEKBW3UXCWU"&gt;To find out, the OHSU team used a mouse model of the disease to examine the entire ensemble of antibodies involved, rather than studying one antibody one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="THO2OH24T5GBLA5DMOXILIGU2U"&gt;The researchers also relied on an advanced imaging method called cryo-electron microscopy, which allows scientists to see biological structures at near-atomic detail. OHSU houses one of only three &lt;a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/pacific-northwest-cryo-em-center" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;national cryo-electron microscopy centers&lt;/a&gt; at its South Waterfront campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OLAP2DSO4JDEVEU3V6YAVBIYK4"&gt;What they found surprised them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2HNHINLHC5GAFPB3MB5KOUQMHY"&gt;“We found that the antibodies don’t bind everywhere,” said Eric Gouaux, a senior scientist at OHSU and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. “They don’t coat the receptor like a layer of paint. Instead, they bind to just a few very specific areas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FKYH2R5ZWVD33P6BBUX6VEZYUY"&gt;The antibodies don’t immediately shut down the receptor. Instead, they act more like glue, causing receptors to clump together and get pulled inside brain cells, where they can’t do their job. That’s when symptoms begin to escalate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2O2JBTSPNFAANNBWBLH2VLATNY"&gt;“It can begin in a rather occult way,” Westbrook said. “Someone may be behaving a little funny, and people don’t quite know what’s happening. It may be days or weeks before the full picture becomes clear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7IJJ53YA3ZBFDJ333UMYX6MRPA"&gt;But Westbrook said diagnosing the disorder early is notoriously difficult because its symptoms can mimic psychiatric illness, viral infections or other neurological disorders.

&lt;p&gt;In 2025, a 47-year Swedish study redefined the timeline of physical aging. Conducted by researchers at &lt;em&gt;Karolinska Institutet&lt;/em&gt;, the findings suggest that measurable decline in fitness and strength begins far earlier than widely assumed. The onset occurs well before conventional markers of aging appear in clinical assessments or public health guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Drawing on continuous assessments of a nationally representative cohort born in 1958, the study traced physical capacity from adolescence through early old age. Across all metrics, including &lt;strong&gt;aerobic performance&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;muscular endurance&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;explosive power&lt;/strong&gt;, the same pattern emerged: &lt;strong&gt;peak capacity is typically reached in the early to mid-30s&lt;/strong&gt;, followed by gradual but accelerating decline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The timing has implications for how conditions such as &lt;strong&gt;sarcopenia&lt;/strong&gt; are understood and addressed. Although physical decline appears to be biologically programmed, the researchers identified several modifiable factors that significantly influence the &lt;strong&gt;rate and severity of deterioration&lt;/strong&gt;. The findings establish a new baseline for interpreting functional aging across general populations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Performance Losses Begin Early and Accelerate With Age&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Swedish Physical Activity and Fitness (SPAF)&lt;/strong&gt; study followed 427 participants, nearly half of them women, through five structured physical evaluations at ages 16, 27, 34, 52, and 63. Physical performance was measured through submaximal aerobic testing on a cycle ergometer, muscular endurance via fixed-weight bench press, and &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/11/tiny-dinosaur-fossil-with-giant-claws/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="111035" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscular power&lt;/a&gt; using vertical jump height.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aerobic capacity&lt;/strong&gt; reached its peak between ages 35 and 36 in both men and women, then declined at a modest rate of less than 1 percent annually. After age 45, the rate increased steadily, reaching over 2 percent per year by the sixth decade of life. By age 63, men had lost 33 percent and women 30 percent of their peak aerobic output, as detailed in the full publication in &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcsm.70134" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When adjusted for body weight, &lt;strong&gt;relative aerobic capacity&lt;/strong&gt; followed a slightly earlier trajectory. Men peaked at age 26, women at 31. Decline rates increased from around 1.1 percent at age 40 to more than 2.2 percent by age 63. Total relative losses reached 40 percent in men and 37 percent in women.&lt;/p&gt;

Meanwhile, rates of &lt;strong&gt;normal weight&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;leisure-time physical activity (LTPA)&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;perceived good health&lt;/strong&gt; declined with age, while &lt;strong&gt;smoking prevalence&lt;/strong&gt; dropped sharply, especially among men (c). These trends reflect a shift toward lower metabolic health and reduced self-rated wellbeing over time. Credit: Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Muscular endurance&lt;/strong&gt;, measured by the number of repetitions in a bench press test using standard weights, peaked around age 36. Annual losses were initially under 1 percent but climbed to 2.5 percent by the study’s endpoint. Cumulative declines totaled 35 percent for men and 32 percent for women.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Muscular power&lt;/strong&gt;, as indicated by vertical jump tests, showed the steepest decline. Peak values were observed at age 27 for men and 19 for women. By age 63, women had lost 48 percent and men 41 percent of their jump height. Performance loss accelerated with age, increasing from roughly 1 percent per year at age 40 to 2.2 percent by age 63.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite significant differences in baseline performance levels, the study found &lt;strong&gt;no measurable differences&lt;/strong&gt; between sexes in the &lt;strong&gt;rate of decline&lt;/strong&gt; across any metric. This held even as men consistently demonstrated higher absolute scores.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Education, Activity Levels, and Lifetime Variation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers also analyzed lifestyle and demographic variables associated with long-term physical capacity. &lt;strong&gt;Leisure-time physical activity&lt;/strong&gt; was the most consistent predictor of stronger performance across all categories. Participants who were active at age 16 continued to outperform inactive peers well into later life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Significantly, individuals who became active in adulthood demonstrated clear benefits. Switching from inactivity to activity at any age led to &lt;strong&gt;improvements ranging from 6 to 11 percent&lt;/strong&gt;, depending on the physical domain. These gains held after controlling for other factors, including age, sex, and body mass index.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Higher &lt;strong&gt;educational attainment&lt;/strong&gt; was linked to better performance in aerobic and endurance tests. Participants with university degrees consistently outperformed those without. No advantage was observed in muscular power.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study also highlighted a growing gap in performance outcomes across the population as participants aged. &lt;strong&gt;Variance in physical capacity increased sharply&lt;/strong&gt; over time: 25-fold for relative aerobic capacity, nearly fivefold for vertical jump height, and threefold for muscular endurance. This suggests that while early adulthood performance is relatively homogenous, aging introduces divergent trajectories influenced by cumulative factors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A summary of the findings published by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260116035336.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ScienceDaily&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; emphasized the role of consistent physical activity across the &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2026/01/word-finding-difficulty-sign-of-cognitive-decline/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="118039" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lifespan&lt;/a&gt;, even when initiated in middle age, noting that adults who became active later still experienced measurable gains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Statistical modeling showed that &lt;strong&gt;30 to 50 percent of variation&lt;/strong&gt; in long-term outcomes could be attributed to stable individual differences rather than random error. This supports the view that early-life physical aptitude is a strong predictor of lifelong capacity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Biological Inflection Point and Structural Limits&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers distinguished between two dimensions of physical aging: the &lt;strong&gt;timing of peak capacity&lt;/strong&gt;, which appeared biologically predetermined, and the &lt;strong&gt;rate of decline&lt;/strong&gt;, which was highly sensitive to behavior and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Physical activity was found to slow the rate of deterioration but &lt;strong&gt;did not delay the initial onset&lt;/strong&gt; of decline. This aligns with prior research on elite athletes, where performance losses still begin in the mid-30s despite sustained training. In contrast to athlete populations, however, the general public exhibited sharper losses; by age 63, SPAF participants retained only 60 to 65 percent of their peak function, compared to over 80 percent in master athletes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that &lt;strong&gt;neuromuscular changes&lt;/strong&gt;—including declining mitochondrial efficiency, reduced motor unit recruitment, and increased fibrosis—may begin decades before clinical symptoms of muscle dysfunction emerge. These changes likely drive the decline observed across fitness domains well before age 40.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Physical activity can slow the decline in performance, even if it cannot completely stop it,” said lead author Maria Westerståhl in her statement, emphasizing the value of remaining active regardless of age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The data suggest a misalignment between clinical frameworks and biological trajectories. Current screening and prevention protocols often begin in the fifth or sixth decade of life, potentially missing the earlier window when interventions are most effective.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As Americans increasingly report &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2022/10/multiple-stressors-no-function#"&gt;feeling overwhelmed by daily life&lt;/a&gt;, many are using &lt;a href="https://civicscience.com/more-americans-prioritizing-self-care-amid-declining-well-being/"&gt;self-care&lt;/a&gt; to cope. Conversations and social media feeds are saturated with the language of “me time,” burnout, boundaries and nervous system regulation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To meet this demand, the wellness industry has grown into a &lt;a href="https://globalwellnessinstitute.org/industry-research/2025-global-wellness-economy-monitor/"&gt;multitrillion-dollar global market&lt;/a&gt;. Myriad providers offer products, services and lifestyle prescriptions that promise calm, balance and restoration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, though, even as interest in self-care continues to grow, Americans’ mental health &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/700079/mental-health-ratings-continue-worsen.aspx"&gt;is getting worse&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a professor of &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PD3BtwIAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;public health&lt;/a&gt; who studies health behaviors and the gap between intentions and outcomes. I became interested in this self-care paradox recently, after I suffered from a concussion. I was prescribed two months of strictly screen-free cognitive rest – no television, email, Zooming, social media, streaming or texting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits were almost immediate, and they surprised me. I slept better, had a longer attention span and had a newfound sense of mental quiet. These effects reflected a well-established principle in neuroscience: When cognitive and emotional stimuli decrease, the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/biology14040395"&gt;brain’s regulatory systems can recover&lt;/a&gt; from overload and chronic stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, most people can’t go 100% screen-free for days, much less months, but the underlying principle offers a powerful lesson for practicing effective self-care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A nation under strain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Americans’ self-rated mental health is now at the &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/700079/mental-health-ratings-continue-worsen.aspx"&gt;lowest point since Gallup started tracking this issue in 2001&lt;/a&gt;. National surveys consistently detect &lt;a href="https://www.stress.org/news/what-the-latest-reports-say-about-stress-in-america/"&gt;high levels of stress and emotional strain&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roughly one-third of U.S. adults report &lt;a href="https://casatondemand.org/2024/02/15/insights-from-the-latest-stress-in-america-report/"&gt;feeling overwhelmed most days&lt;/a&gt;. Sleep disruption, anxiety, poor concentration and emotional exhaustion are widespread, particularly among &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/658082/pandemic-effects-linger-americans-health-ratings.aspx"&gt;young adults and women&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chronic disease patterns mirror this strain. When daily stress becomes chronic, it can trigger biological changes that &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/understanding-the-stress-response"&gt;increase the risk of long-term conditions&lt;/a&gt; like heart disease and diabetes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 6 in 10 U.S. adults live with at least one chronic condition, and 4 in 10 live with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chronic-disease/about/index.html"&gt;multiple chronic conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;iframe class="native-lazy" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QMOc-4zNj30?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Stress triggers physiological responses that can lead to a range of symptoms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How people try to cope&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Americans say they actively practice self-care in everyday life. For example, they describe taking mental health days, protecting personal time, setting boundaries around work and &lt;a href="https://civicscience.com/more-americans-prioritizing-self-care-amid-declining-well-being/"&gt;prioritizing rest and leisure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem lies in how they use that leisure time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 22 years, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ American Time Use Survey has consistently found that &lt;a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.nr0.htm"&gt;watching television is the most popular leisure activity&lt;/a&gt; for U.S. adults. Americans spend far more time watching TV than exercising, spending time with friends or practicing reflection through activities like yoga. Other common self-care activities include &lt;a href="https://civicscience.com/more-americans-prioritizing-self-care-amid-declining-well-being/"&gt;watching movies and gaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern leisure time increasingly includes smartphone use. Surveys suggest that mobile phones have become the dominant screen for many Americans, with adults spending &lt;a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/cell_phones/cell-phone-statistics.html#"&gt;several hours per day on their phones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many adults, checking social media or watching short videos has become a default relaxation behavior layered on top of traditional screen use. This practice is often referred to as &lt;a href="https://www.digitalturbine.com/blog/second-screening-understanding-usage-and-audiences"&gt;second screening&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although many people turn to screen-based activities to wind down, these activities may have the opposite effect biologically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why modern screen use feels different&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-internet forms of leisure often involved activities such as watching scheduled television programs, listening to radio broadcasts or reading books and magazines. For all of these pastimes, the content followed a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience_flow"&gt;predictable sequence with natural stopping points&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s digital media environment looks very different. People routinely engage with multiple screens at once, respond to frequent notifications and switch rapidly between several streams of content. These environments continuously require users to split their attention, engage their emotions and make decisions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of mental multitasking draws on the same neural systems people are often attempting to rest with leisure. The result is a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/tmb0000106"&gt;far more fragmented and cognitively demanding environment&lt;/a&gt; than in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Americans now spend approximately &lt;a href="https://www.comparitech.com/tv-streaming/screen-time-statistics/"&gt;six to seven hours per day&lt;/a&gt; on screens across multiple devices. Splitting attention between more than one screen at a time, such as using the phone while watching television, is common. This juggling exposes peoples’ brains to &lt;a href="https://research.mountain.com/insights/an-exploration-of-second-screen-use-by-tv-viewers/"&gt;multiple streams of sensory and emotional input simultaneously&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Survey data also suggests that Americans &lt;a href="https://www.nbcpalmsprings.com/2024/12/18/americans-check-their-phones-205-times-a-day-in-2024-report-reveals"&gt;may check their phones roughly 200 times per day&lt;/a&gt;. In doing so, they repeatedly pull their attention back to screens during routine moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern digital platforms are designed to maximize engagement. Algorithms tend to prioritize emotionally arousing content, particularly &lt;a href="https://freemannews.tulane.edu/2024/10/11/rage-clicks-study-shows-how-political-outrage-fuels-social-media-engagement"&gt;anger, anxiety and outrage&lt;/a&gt;. These feelings drive clicks, sharing and time spent on platforms. Research has shown that this design is associated with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2025.102647"&gt;higher stress, distraction and cognitive load&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;When ‘rest’ doesn’t restore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against the backdrop of daily hassles and competing demands, it can feel like relief to flip on the TV. Practices such as streaming or so-called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed_rotting"&gt;bed-rotting&lt;/a&gt; – spending extended periods in bed while scrolling – often are framed as &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/bed-rotting-self-care"&gt;a form of radical rest or self-care&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other common coping behaviors include leaving the television on as background noise, scrolling between tasks throughout the day or using phones during meals and conversations. These strategies can feel restful because they temporarily reduce external demands and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, pairing rest with screen use may undermine the very restoration that people are seeking. Digital media &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actpsy.2025.105674"&gt;stimulate attention, emotion and sensory processing&lt;/a&gt;. Even while people are sitting or lying still, being onscreen can keep their nervous systems in a heightened state of arousal. It may look like downtime, but it doesn’t create the &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/mental-health/seven-rest-types"&gt;biological conditions for restoration&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to wind down&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that mental relief comes not from adding new coping strategies, but from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/biology14040395"&gt;reducing the number of demands placed on the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal is to intentionally reduce mental load, not to abandon all digital devices.&lt;/p&gt;
