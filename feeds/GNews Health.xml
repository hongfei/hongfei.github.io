Explanations have often focused on pregnancy-related hormonal changes, but research &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09713-5" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published Tuesday in Nature&lt;/a&gt; has found breastfeeding provides long-lasting immune protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Sherene Loi, a clinician scientist at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, said the most sophisticated level of the immune system, called the adaptive immune system, involves T-cells which react against particular viruses or bacteria – and also against cancer. This response is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/06/cancer-cure-immunotherapy" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;“one of our very modern therapeutic weapons against cancer”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Loi, the senior author of the new study, said her team had noticed some breast cancers had large amounts of these specialised immune cells, while others had very few.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="a21567b7-aac0-40d8-9c02-62cb0cc93b00" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Women who miss first breast cancer screening at ‘40% higher risk’ of dying from the disease","elementId":"a21567b7-aac0-40d8-9c02-62cb0cc93b00","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/24/women-who-miss-first-breast-cancer-screening-at-40-higher-risk-of-dying-from-the-disease"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Patients who had more cells had better outcomes, particularly for one of the most aggressive types: triple-negative breast cancer. These immune cells were also found in healthy breast tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study sought to investigate why these T-cells were already there, whether they were related to pregnancy and breastfeeding, and if they protected against breast cancer formation and growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers studied noncancerous breast tissue of more than 260 women from diverse populations who had breast reductions or surgery to reduce their risk of breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They found those who had children had more of these specialised cells, called CD8⁺ T-cells. These cells remained in the breasts for more than 30 years after pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Using mice models, the researchers then implanted cancerous cells into the equivalent of their breast tissue, and found they grew less in the mice that had had pups and breastfed, than in virgin mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When they depleted the T-cells from the mice with pups, they lost the protection. This suggested the T-cells were directly responsible for the effect, Loi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers then investigated whether women who breastfed lived longer with triple-negative breast cancer. They looked at studies involving more than&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;1,000 breast cancer patients diagnosed after having children, and had a record of their breastfeeding history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They found that women who had breastfed did better from their triple-negative breast cancer than those who had not. Their tumours also had more immune cells, suggesting there was ongoing immune activation and regulation from the body against their breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The key take-home messages [are] that pregnancy and breastfeeding will leave behind long-lived protective immune cells in the breast and the body, and these cells help to reduce risk and improve defence against breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer, but potentially other cancers as well as disease,” Loi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Loi said the study provided an explanation why breastfeeding is protective, so that it can be used in the future to try to recreate this effect in women who don’t have children or are unable to breastfeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Understanding the biological mechanism could help develop vaccines and new strategies to mimic this protection, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She emphasised even if women do breastfeed, it’s not a 100% guarantee that they won’t get breast cancer. “The effects are really quite small for every individual, but population wide the effects are large.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Associate Prof Wendy Ingman from the University of Adelaide’s Medical School said the longer the duration of breastfeeding, the greater the benefits. She said, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9972148/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;for every year of breastfeeding, there is a 4% lifetime reduction&lt;/a&gt; in the mother’s breast cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This study shows that having babies and breastfeeding causes long-lasting changes in immune cells that could help protect the breast from cancer,” she said. “I’m hopeful that this type of research will lead to new approaches to reduce women’s breast cancer risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 20:20:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNZ0JJQVdCenlRVWhFVzNTVE5QSGp3U08xLVZCRUNHZ1JHWXI2X2VNdGQ3S1BOX2dHZ2MwN3JXNjFFaW83cDR0RVpHY1RqNWhZczRsVjJpbWh3OGhVcEJyYzNPN2l1MGtCdDZXU2NjNml3eWt4czlDaG10MXZFYS1DZ3o1QTBSRUQyN1pRa0ZiZ3pxZjRrNkJRcEpVaTZSZDZ1aFlQWjduNXJnR3QxTy0wMWtpRQ</guid></item><item><title>使用微小的眼睛植入物和特殊的眼镜，一些合法失明的患者可以再次阅读- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/tiny-eye-implant-special-glasses-legally-blind-patients-can-read-rcna238488</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ed4333" class="body-graf"&gt;People with a leading cause of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/using-stem-cells-doctors-restore-vision-people-blinded-one-eye-rcna100408" target="_blank"&gt;blindness&lt;/a&gt; were able to read again thanks to a tiny wireless chip implanted in the back of the eye and specialized augmented glasses, according to study results published Monday in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2501396" target="_blank"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b9fefb" class="body-graf"&gt;The trial involved 38 European patients, all of whom had an advanced stage of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) known as geographic atrophy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a4b23b" class="body-graf"&gt;There is no cure for AMD, which is driven by changes in a part of the retina called the macula and caused by inflammation and a build-up of waste. The photoreceptor cells in the macula are responsible for producing sharp, detailed and colored vision. When the disease has progressed to the geographic atrophy stage, these cells deteriorate and die, and people lose their central vision — meaning that an object straight ahead may appear blurry or covered up with a dark blotch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-52e65a" class="body-graf"&gt;Roughly 22 million people in the U.S. have AMD, and about 1 million have geographic atrophy, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.macular.org/about-macular-degeneration/geographic-atrophy" target="_blank"&gt;American Macular Degeneration Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-90387c" class="body-graf"&gt;In the study, the participants, who had an average age of 79,  were fitted with the “PRIMA device,” a system meant to replicate vision. Patients wear augmented reality glasses embedded with a camera that captures their visual field. What the camera “sees” is transmitted to the chip &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/eye-implant-pig-protein-restored-sight-blind-people-rcna42681" target="_blank"&gt;implanted in their eye&lt;/a&gt; in the form of infrared light. The chip converts the light into an electrical current, which stimulates the remaining healthy cells in the macula in a realistic way, enabling signals these cells send to be interpreted by the brain as vision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-162846" class="body-graf"&gt;An image processor, which the user must carry, lets patients zoom in and magnify the images they see, which appear in black and white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-e0020b"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1125" data-original-width="2000"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251029-tiny-eye-implant-inline-lr-1b498c.png 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251029-tiny-eye-implant-inline-lr-1b498c.png 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251029-tiny-eye-implant-inline-lr-1b498c.png 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251029-tiny-eye-implant-inline-lr-1b498c.png 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251029-tiny-eye-implant-inline-lr-1b498c.png" alt="The image on the right shows what the camera sends to the user's implanted microchip."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;The image on the right shows what the camera sends to the user's implanted microchip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Science Corporation &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-405dba" class="body-graf"&gt;With the help of the PRIMA device, 80% of the 32 patients who returned for a reassessment one year after the chip implantation had achieved clinically meaningful visual improvements. Patients did experience side effects, predominantly related to the surgical procedure: The study reported that 26 serious adverse events occurred in 19 of the patients, ranging from elevated blood pressure in the eye to an accumulation of blood around the retina. The majority of the adverse events resolved within two months of the implantation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-de077d" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s the first ever therapeutic approach that has led to an improvement in visual function in this group of patients,” said Dr. Frank Holz, the trial’s lead investigator and chair of the department of ophthalmology at the University Hospital of Bonn in Germany. “Late-stage age-related macular degeneration is a dismal disease. Patients are no longer capable of reading, driving a car, watching TV or even recognizing faces. So [these results] are a game-changer in my mind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b59ed3" class="body-graf"&gt;One patient, Sheila Irvine, 70, who was fitted with the PRIMA device at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, said in a statement provided by the hospital that her life before receiving the implant was akin to “having two black discs in my eyes, with the outside distorted.” A self-described “avid bookworm” before losing her vision, Irvine said she was now able to do crosswords and read prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fc6cb2" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Sunir Garg, professor of ophthalmology at the retina service of Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia, who was not involved in the study, said the results represent a breakthrough for patients with geographic atrophy. All doctors have been able to offer, he said, are visual aids, like magnifiers, and emotional support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7b95a0" class="body-graf"&gt;“Even with new medical therapies, the best that we can do is slow it down,” said Garg, who works with several drugmakers involved in treatments for AMD, including Apellis Pharmaceuticals, the maker of pegcetacoplan. That drug, which slows the progression of geographic atrophy, was recently approved in the U.S. and must be injected into the eye every 1 to 2 months. “We can’t stop it, and we can’t do anything to bring back lost vision.”   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-6b5c8c"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1333" data-original-width="2000"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251019-prima-eye-implant-vl-443p-fecf6c.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251019-prima-eye-implant-vl-443p-fecf6c.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251019-prima-eye-implant-vl-443p-fecf6c.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251019-prima-eye-implant-vl-443p-fecf6c.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251019-prima-eye-implant-vl-443p-fecf6c.jpg" alt="An old woman wears glasses with a device attached to one of the lenses"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;An actor wearing the PRIMA system glasses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Science Corporation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-769765" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Demetrios Vavvas, director of the retina service at Mass Eye and Ear in Boston, who was also not involved in the study, said that the PRIMA system is not without limitations.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f54edd" class="body-graf"&gt;Vavvas noted that the surgery required to implant the chip in the eye requires a high level of surgical skill and is not without risk. “You have to lift the retina off its normal position to implant this device, which increases the atrophy,” said Vavvas, who is a consultant to Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals, a company working on stem cell therapies for patients with other forms of vision loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-076743" class="body-graf"&gt;Vavvas said it was important to note that the device isn’t restoring normal vision, as patients were only able to see in black and white rather than color, and the trial participants had to undergo a significant amount of training in order to learn how to see with the PRIMA device. He also said that it wasn’t clear whether the enhancements in visual ability had significantly improved the patients’ quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0e3c14" class="body-graf"&gt;But at the same time, Vavvas was also optimistic about its future potential, describing the current iteration of PRIMA as a key stepping stone in the field of vision restoration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-71b486" class="body-graf"&gt;“Think of this device as the pre-release iPhone,” he said. “The limitations are clear. We shouldn’t oversell that the quality of life really improved. But there were certain [visual] tasks at which the patients were clearly better. So it shows to us that there is potential in this approach. It is still in some ways, a prototype. They’re working on iterations of this device that will be better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5962f8" class="body-graf"&gt;New upgrades to the PRIMA device could be coming in the next couple of years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-da6dfb" class="body-graf"&gt;The PRIMA system was invented by Stanford University ophthalmology professor Daniel Palanker and is being developed by the California-based neural engineering company Science Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d03186" class="body-graf"&gt;Palanker said technical improvements are being made to increase the number of pixels in the chip from 400 to 10,000. The new chips have already been tested in rats, and the upgraded chips are being manufactured for future human trials. With the aid of the camera’s zoom function, Palanker said that this could theoretically enable patients to achieve 20/20 visual resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-04d93b"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1333" data-original-width="2000"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251019-prima-eye-implant-vl-441p-954dea.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251019-prima-eye-implant-vl-441p-954dea.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251019-prima-eye-implant-vl-441p-954dea.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251019-prima-eye-implant-vl-441p-954dea.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251019-prima-eye-implant-vl-441p-954dea.jpg" alt="A penny is next to an implant chip that is about 1/50th of it's size, laid on a surface"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;The microchip shown next to a penny.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Science Corporation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2d28f1" class="body-graf"&gt;“We are also working on next generation software that will allow patients to perceive not just black-and-white text, but also grey-scale natural images, such as faces,” Palanker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7d0485" class="body-graf"&gt;Palanker suggested that the technology could be trialed in other retinal diseases that cause blindness, such as Stargardt disease, which has similar symptoms to age-related macular degeneration but is genetic and usually affects younger people.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-469478" class="body-graf"&gt;Garg and Vavvas are eager to see larger trials that provide more details about how the device improves patients’ ability to function on a day-to-day basis.

With this new designation, the AHA wants people to understand that the conditions are closely connected," &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/articles/what-is-ckm-syndrome" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Mass General Brigham explains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To diagnose CKM syndrome, providers will test different risk factors, to determine your stage from 0 to 4, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic-syndrome" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Stage 0 means no risk factors; Stage 1 means you have excess body fat; Stage 2 means you have a condition such as Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure or kidney disease; Stage 3 means you have heart disease without symptoms or a high risk of it; and Stage 4 means you have heart disease with symptoms, extra body fat and risk factors for diabetes or other metabolic conditions. Stage 4 could also include kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2818457" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; published in JAMA last year, nearly 90% of U.S. adults have at least one risk factor for CKM syndrome, which include the following: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Abnormal cholesterol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High blood sugar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excess weight&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduced kidney function&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The interplay of these risk factors increases the risk for heart attack, stroke and heart failure more than any one of them alone," the AHA said in a news release about its survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes to eating habits and physical activity can help prevent CKM syndrome, AHA and other experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2023 interview with &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/on-call-with-dr-kumar-cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic-syndrome-or-ckm-explained/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;CBS New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, cardiologist Dr. Nidhi Kumar said 33% of Americans have three or more risk factors that contribute to this syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we think of danger in medicine, sometimes people think of the words 'cancer' or 'COVID,' but chronic diseases, like those that make up CKM, are the leading cause of death and disability in the United States," Kumar said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eduardo Sanchez, the American Heart Association's chief medical officer for prevention, said in a statement that it's important for people to know it's common to have heart, kidney and metabolic risk factors at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is reassuring that once the CKM connection was defined nearly three-quarters of those responding understood that it was important and wanted to learn more," Sanchez said about the AHA survey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cleveland Clinic adds, "researchers are hoping for a future where everyone gets holistic treatment for CKM syndrome instead of treatment for one body system at a time." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Harris Poll conducted the survey, which included about 4,000 U.S. adults, in August 2025 on behalf of the association.&lt;/p&gt;

By analyzing over 5,000 blood proteins, they identified molecular signs of damage to myelin—the protective sheath around nerve fibers—long before symptoms emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key biomarkers such as IL-3 and MOG reveal a two-stage attack, first targeting myelin and later damaging the nerve fibers themselves. This discovery paves the way for an early diagnostic blood test and, potentially, preventive MS treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Detection:&lt;/strong&gt; Damage to myelin appears up to seven years before MS diagnosis, revealed by a spike in the MOG protein.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune Activation Marker:&lt;/strong&gt; IL-3 plays a central role in recruiting immune cells that trigger early brain inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Diagnostic Tool:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers identified 21 proteins that could form the basis for a predictive blood test for MS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By the time patients start seeking care for multiple sclerosis (MS), the disease has already been damaging their brains for years. But until recently, scientists didn’t understand which brain cells were being targeted or when the injury began.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, by analyzing thousands of proteins found in the blood, scientists at UC San Francisco have created the clearest picture yet of when the disease attacks the myelin sheath that covers the nerve fibers. It shows that the immune system begins attacking the brain even earlier than previously had been thought. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113463"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;During this time, IL-3 and some related proteins that orchestrate an immune reaction appeared in the blood. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study measured debris from these attacks in a person’s blood, along with the signals that coordinate the immune system to go on the attack. It lays out, for the first time, the sequence of events that eventually lead to the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery could lead to new ways to diagnose multiple sclerosis — and possibly one day prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MS first attacks the fatty myelin sheath, and a year later, it’s possible to see the breakdown of nerve fibers themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the many immune signaling proteins that were elevated in the early stage of the disease, one protein stood out: IL-3. It plays an important role in this early phase when the central nervous system is suffering significant damage, but the patient doesn’t yet feel it. IL-3 is known for recruiting immune cells to the brain and spinal cord, where they attack nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think our work opens numerous opportunities for diagnosing, monitoring, and possibility treating MS,” said Ahmed Abdelhak, MD, assistant professor of Neurology at UCSF, and the first and co-lead author of the paper, which appears in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt; on Oct. 20. “It could be a gamechanger for how we understand and manage this disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed more than 5,000 proteins in blood samples from 134 people with MS, both before and after their diagnosis. These samples were provided by the U.S. Department of Defense Serum Repository, which stores samples from armed service members when they apply to join the military. The samples are then available for study decades afterwards, by which time some of the people may have gone on to develop MS.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven years before a person’s diagnosis, they saw a spike in a protein called MOG, which stands for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein and indicates damage to the insulation around the wires of the nervous system. A year after the MOG spike appeared, they saw a spike in another protein called neurofilament light chain, which indicates damage to the wires themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this time, IL-3 and some related proteins that orchestrate an immune reaction appeared in the blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team identified about 50 proteins that herald future disease, and they have submitted a patent application for a diagnostic blood test using the top 21 of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ari Green, MD, chief of the Division of Neuroimmunology and Glial Biology in the UCSF Department of Neurology and senior author of the paper, said the study offers the hope of prevention and it gives a deeper understanding of what leads to the development of symptoms in MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We now know that MS starts way earlier than the clinical onset, creating the real possibility that we could someday prevent MS — or at least use our understanding to protect people from further injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors:&lt;/strong&gt; Other UCSF authors are Gabriel Cerono, MD, Kiarra Ning, John Boscardin, PhD, The UCSF ORIGINS Study, Christian Cordano, MD, PhD, Asritha Tubati, Camille Fouassier, Eric D.

We used high-throughput discovery proteomics and samples from presymptomatic patients with MS and matched healthy controls to define the biological neurological onset and characterize the mechanisms involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, evidence of myelin injury was seen ~7 years before the symptomatic onset and preceded evidence of axonal injury by ~1 year. By contrast, astrocyte involvement became evident only at clinical onset. Numerous changes in the serum proteome indicate the involvement of interleukin 3 and nuclear factor kappa B pathways during the presymptomatic stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, people with MS with a previously reported distinct autoantibody signature showed increased immune cell activity compared to those without. We propose a protein biomarker panel that may help distinguish presymptomatic patients with MS from healthy controls, pending validation in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings can help understand the pathophysiology of MS as well as the cascade of central nervous system injury and might facilitate early detection of MS in high-risk people.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 16:17:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTFBWaUwxUWhzYTVEcVhtemdEZ1ZzcGl2aDF5YjdZbzM1VUhSVHB5eTRSWWFCWElCbUg2SmRUNjdwLTJSVmZGdEdhS1FRdnhSaFp6cDhFYXk3TUU5SWMtZTJBOWZtZXBaTGc</guid></item><item><title>美国国家医学科学院选出100名新成员-美国国家医学科学院</title><link>https://nam.edu/news-and-insights/100-new-members-elected-2025/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="elementor-element elementor-element-63cdbef1 big-para elementor-widget elementor-widget-theme-post-content" data-id="63cdbef1" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON — The National Academy of Medicine (NAM) today announced the election of 90 regular members and 10 international members during its &lt;a href="https://nam.edu/events/annual-meeting/"&gt;annual meeting&lt;/a&gt;. Election to the Academy is considered one of the highest honors in the fields of health and medicine and recognizes individuals who have demonstrated outstanding professional achievement and commitment to service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am deeply honored to welcome these extraordinary health and medicine leaders and researchers into the National Academy of Medicine,” said NAM President Victor J. Dzau. “Their demonstrated excellence in tackling public health challenges, leading major discoveries, improving health care, advancing health policy, and addressing health equity will critically strengthen our collective ability to tackle the most pressing health challenges of our time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New members are elected by current members through a process that recognizes individuals who have made major contributions to the advancement of the medical sciences, health care, and public health. A diversity of talent among NAM’s membership is assured by its Articles of Organization, which stipulate that at least one-quarter of the membership is selected from fields outside the health professions — for example, from such fields as law, engineering, social sciences, and the humanities. The newly elected members bring NAM’s total membership to more than 2,500, which includes more than 200 international members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Established originally as the Institute of Medicine in 1970 by the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine addresses critical issues in health, science, medicine, and related policy and inspires positive actions across sectors. NAM works alongside the National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Engineering to provide independent, objective analysis and advice to the nation and conduct other activities to solve complex problems and inform public policy decisions. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine also encourage education and research, recognize outstanding contributions to knowledge, and increase public understanding of STEMM. With their election, NAM members make a commitment to volunteer their service in National Academies activities.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever taken an edible to more easily drift off to bed, you’re not the only one. New research shows that a substantial portion of young American adults have used cannabis and/or alcohol as a sleep aid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of Michigan conducted the study, which examined nationally representative survey data. They found that roughly one in five young adults have relied on these two drugs to help them sleep at times, particularly cannabis. Though effective, people’s overreliance on these drugs could eventually become a double-edged sword, the researchers caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Cannabis and alcohol can help initiate sleep, but regular use may be problematic,” they wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2840034"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this month in JAMA Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A common sleep aid&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers examined data from the Monitoring the Future (MTF) Panel Study, a long-running project measuring drug use among teens and young adults. The project, run by the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research, routinely surveys high schoolers about their use of drugs and overall health, then continues to follow a subset of students into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The current study involved nearly 1,500 people between the ages of 19 and 30. Approximately 22% had reported using either cannabis and/or alcohol in the past year to help them sleep, the researchers found. Around 18% reported using cannabis specifically, while about 7% used alcohol. Of those who reported using cannabis in general, roughly 41% had used it at times for sleep, compared to nearly 9% of regular alcohol users. People who used these drugs daily or near-daily were also more likely to report using them as sleep aids.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Potential issues&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many of us struggle with sleep from time to time. A 2022 study &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2798209"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that roughly 30% of U.S. adults have had trouble sleeping, including 23% of U.S. adults between the ages of 20 and 39. So it’s certainly understandable why many young people turn to these drugs to help them doze off. But the researchers note that there are real tradeoffs to using cannabis and alcohol for sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The most notable drawback is that our body gradually gets habituated to these drugs, meaning it takes increasing amounts to feel the same effects. In other words, over time, a person might need more cannabis or alcohol to help them sleep. These larger doses can then raise the risk of someone developing an unhealthy dependency on these drugs, also known as a substance use disorder. Trying to wean off these drugs can also be tricky, since both &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/marijuana-weed-withdrawal"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/alcohol-withdrawal"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; withdrawal can cause insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers say that doctors should be more aware about the common use of cannabis and alcohol for sleep, which may help them step in before either a person’s sleeping or drug habits can become a bigger issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Raising clinicians’ awareness about the common intersection of substance use and sleep problems among young adults is important for screening and developing and offering clinical interventions for these critical health risk behaviors,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

The implant, which measures 2 millimetres by 2 millimetres, and is just 30 micrometres thick, is surgically inserted beneath the retina to replace the light-sensitive cells that have been lost to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinical trial, which is described today in &lt;i&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, involved 38 people with advanced AMD whose retinas had degenerated severely. One year after device implantation, 80% of participants had gained a clinically meaningful improvement in their vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Where this dead retina was a complete blind spot, vision was restored,” says trial leader Frank Holz, an ophthalmologist at the University of Bonn in Germany. “Patients could read letters, they could read words, and they could function in their daily life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02629-w" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03420-x/d41586-025-03420-x_19705470.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Reversing blindness with stem cells&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite some minor events related to implantation surgery, the trial’s safety-monitoring board viewed the device’s benefits as outweighing its risks. In June, the device’s owners — the San Francisco-based neurotechnology company Science Corporation — applied for certification that would allow the device to be sold on the European market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think this is an exciting and significant study, which has been well-designed and analysed. It gives hope for providing vision in patients for whom this was more ‘science-fiction’ than reality,” says Francesca Cordeiro, an ophthalmologist at Imperial College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Restored vision&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMD is the commonest form of incurable blindness in older people. There are two main types, wet and dry AMD. The current work studied people with dry AMD, the advanced form of which affects around 5 million people globally. In dry AMD, the central retina’s light-sensitive cells die over a period of years, leaving affected individuals with intact peripheral vision but without their high-acuity central vision. “They can’t recognize faces, they can’t read, they can’t drive a car, they can’t watch television,” says Holz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The light-sensitive cells that die (rods and cones) convert light into electrochemical signals that are conveyed to other types of retinal neurons, which then send messages to the brain’s visual-processing regions. Because retinal neurons survive AMD, scientists reasoned that a light-sensitive implant that electrically stimulates the retina according to the pattern of photons striking it could reinstate a sense of vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03575-3" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03420-x/d41586-025-03420-x_19914304.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;A visual guide to repairing the retina&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implant, termed PRIMA — for photovoltaic retina implant microarray — was originally developed by the Paris-based company Pixium Vision, and was acquired by Science Corporation last year. It is wireless, unlike previous retinal devices. And, being photovoltaic, the photons that activate it also provide the energy source for generating its electrical output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is used in combination with glasses that contain a camera that captures images and converts them into patterns of infrared light that they transmit to the retinal implant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system, which allows users to zoom in and out on target objects, and adjust contrast and brightness, does, Holz says, take months of intensive training to use optimally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current study, 38 individuals were treated at 17 clinical sites across 5 European countries, and 32 of the participants were tested a year after implantation. Twenty-six of them had a clinically meaningful improvement in their vision — which, on average, amounted to being able to see two lines further down a standard eye test chart of letters. Overall, most participants’ vision came close to the resolution achievable with PRIMA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the study’s end, most recipients were using PRIMA at home to read letters, words and numbers. Of the 32, 22 said that their user satisfaction was medium to high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;A decade after a landmark study proved that feeding peanut products to young babies could prevent development of life-threatening allergies, new research finds the change has made a big difference in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peanut allergies began to decline in the U.S. after guidance first issued in 2015 upended medical practice by recommending introducing the allergen to infants starting as early as 4 months. The rate of peanut allergies in children ages 0 to 3 fell by more than 27% after guidance for high-risk kids was first issued in 2015, and by more than 40% after the recommendations were expanded in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s a remarkable thing, right?” said Dr. David Hill, an allergist and researcher at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and author of a study published Monday in the medical journal Pediatrics. Hill and colleagues analyzed electronic health records from dozens of pediatric practices to track diagnoses of food allergies in young children before, during and after the guidelines were issued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/giving-babies-peanut-based-foods-early-prevents-allergies"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Give peanuts to infants to prevent allergies, new guidelines say&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can actually come to you today and say there are less kids with food allergy today than there would have been if we hadn’t implemented this public health effort,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 60,000 children have avoided food allergies since 2015, including 40,000 children who otherwise would have developed peanut allergies. Still, about 8% of children are affected by food allergies, including more than 2% with a peanut allergy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peanut allergy is caused when the body’s immune system mistakenly identifies proteins in peanuts as harmful and releases chemicals that trigger allergic symptoms, including hives, respiratory symptoms and, sometimes, life-threatening anaphylaxis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, doctors had recommended delaying feeding children peanuts and other foods likely to trigger allergies until age 3. But in 2015, Gideon Lack at King’s College London, published the groundbreaking Learning Early About Peanut Allergy, or LEAP, trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lack and colleagues showed that introducing peanut products in infancy reduced the future risk of developing food allergies by more than 80%. Later analysis showed that the protection persisted in about 70% of kids into adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study immediately sparked new guidelines urging early introduction of peanuts — but putting them into practice has been slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only about 29% of pediatricians and 65% of allergists reported following the expanded guidance issued in 2017, surveys found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confusion and uncertainty about the best way to introduce peanuts early in life led to the lag, according to a commentary that accompanied the study. Early on, medical experts and parents alike questioned whether the practice could be adopted outside of tightly controlled clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data for the analysis came from a subset of participating practice sites and may not represent the entire U.S. pediatric population, noted the commentary, led by Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a child allergy expert at Northwestern University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the new research offers “promising evidence that early allergen introduction is not only being adopted but may be making a measurable impact,” the authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocates for the 33 million people in the U.S. with food allergies welcomed signs that early introduction of peanut products is catching on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This research reinforces what we already know and underscores a meaningful opportunity to reduce the incidence and prevalence of peanut allergy nationwide,” said Sung Poblete, chief executive of the nonprofit group Food Allergy Research &amp;amp; Education, or FARE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study emphasizes the current guidance, updated in 2021, which calls for introducing peanuts and other major food allergens between four and six months, without prior screening or testing, Hill said. Parents should consult their pediatricians about any questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t have to be a lot of the food, but little tastes of peanut butter, milk-based yogurt, soy-based yogurts and tree butters,” he said. “These are really good ways to allow the immune system exposure to these allergenic foods in a safe way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiffany Leon, 36, a Maryland registered dietician and director at FARE, introduced peanuts and other allergens early to her own sons, James, 4, and Cameron, 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, Leon’s own mother was shocked at the advice to feed babies such foods before the age of 3, she said. But Leon explained how the science had changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a dietician, I practice evidence-based recommendations,” she said. “So when someone told me, ‘This is how it’s done now, these are the new guidelines,’ I just though, OK, well, this is what we’re going to do.”&lt;/p&gt;

The agency scaled back &lt;a href="/news/2025/9/19/us-vaccine-advisory-panel-does-not-recommend-covid-jabs-for-all"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; vaccine recommendations, approved COVID-19 vaccines for fewer people and aimed to remove the preservative &lt;a href="/news/2025/6/28/what-is-thimerosal-vaccine-preservative-called-toxic-by-us-health-chief"&gt;thimerosal&lt;/a&gt; from US vaccines. Experts told PolitiFact scientific research did not support its removal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section class="more-on"&gt;&lt;h2 class="more-on__heading"&gt;Recommended Stories &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list of 3 items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;end of list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a September 22 news conference, in which US President Donald Trump told people not to take Tylenol during pregnancy, he also mentioned another objective. “We want no aluminium in the vaccine,” he said. The administration was already in the process of removing aluminium from vaccines, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About two weeks later, on October 8, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, announced a new working group focused on the childhood vaccine schedule. Its discussion topics include vaccine ingredient safety and aluminium adjuvants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Malone, an ACIP member who has opposed COVID-19 vaccines, told Axios he expected the ACIP would determine there was “a lot of evidence” of “issues” with aluminium in vaccines. The committee would likely vote to re-categorise vaccines containing aluminium adjuvants so that people would have to discuss with their doctor before getting them, Malone told Axios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could have far-reaching ramifications. Here’s what to know about aluminium in vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: Small amounts of aluminium are sometimes included in vaccines as adjuvants, or substances that boost the body’s immune response to the vaccine to ensure protection from infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That boost means people can get fewer vaccine doses in smaller quantities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-when-used-how-much-aluminium-is-in-a-vaccine"&gt;Q: When used, how much aluminium is in a vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: Vaccines with aluminium adjuvants usually contain less than 1mg aluminium per dose, according to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is a pretty abstract number. To help make it more concrete: a milligram is one-thousandth (1/1,000th) of 1g. One gram is about the weight of a raisin or a stick of gum. Imagine cutting one of those items into 1,000 equal pieces. One of the pieces would be about 1mg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-newsletter-slot" data-testid="article-newsletter-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is another way to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People come in contact with and consume aluminium all of the time. It is one of the most abundant metal elements in the Earth’s crust, according to the US Geological Survey. It is naturally occurring in soil, air and water. Food is the main way people are exposed to aluminium. The average adult eats 7mg to 9mg of aluminium per day, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A baby in its first six months might receive a total of about 4.4mg of aluminium from recommended vaccines. In the same period of time, a breastfed infant would ingest about 7mg of aluminium from breastmilk, and a formula-fed baby would ingest about 38mg from formula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-how-long-have-vaccines-contained-aluminium"&gt;Q: How long have vaccines contained aluminium?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: Aluminium adjuvants have been used in vaccines for more than 70 years, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aluminium is one of our oldest adjuvants; it’s been used in vaccines since the 1920s,” said Dr Peter Hotez, a Baylor College of Medicine professor and codirector of Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-how-do-we-know-it-s-safe-to-include-small-amounts-of-aluminium-in-vaccines"&gt;Q: How do we know it’s safe to include small amounts of aluminium in vaccines?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: Every vaccine’s safety and efficacy are tested in animal studies and human clinical trials before the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licenses it for public use. Every vaccine containing adjuvants has been tested, and health agencies continuously monitor their safety, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over several decades of use, vaccines with aluminium adjuvants have been proven safe, the FDA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines containing aluminium have been “given to billions of people worldwide now”, said Dr Kawsar Talaat, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing body of research has also found that aluminium adjuvants do not cause aluminium toxicity or other adverse outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-do-aluminium-adjuvants-have-any-risks"&gt;Q: Do aluminium adjuvants have any risks?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: Rarely, some people have allergic reactions to aluminium in the same way they might have allergic reactions to other substances, Talaat said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, researchers published a retrospective, observational study on more than 325,000 children that found an association between vaccine-related aluminium exposure and persistent asthma. Association is not the same as causation, meaning the study did not prove a link between aluminium in vaccines and asthma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts from the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics encouraged more research on the subject because the backwards-looking observational study did not prove causation and also had limitations, including that it excluded many children who developed asthma before they turned two years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2025 study found no increased risk of asthma associated with childhood exposure to aluminium-absorbed vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-which-vaccines-contain-aluminium-adjuvants"&gt;Q: Which vaccines contain aluminium adjuvants?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: At least 25 vaccines approved for use in the US have aluminium adjuvants, the CDC says. That includes vaccines that protect against HPV, hepatitis A and B and diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (whooping cough).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-which-vaccines-do-not-contain-aluminium-adjuvants"&gt;Q: Which vaccines do not contain aluminium adjuvants?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s list of vaccines without adjuvants includes vaccines against COVID-19, Ebola, meningococcal, polio and rabies. Additionally, most seasonal flu shots and the vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella do not contain aluminium adjuvants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-can-we-remove-aluminium-from-vaccines"&gt;Q: Can we remove aluminium from vaccines?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: Not quickly. If it could be done at all, it would take years to develop, test and license new, aluminium-free vaccines. Many of the vaccines with aluminium adjuvants do not have aluminium-free formulas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A vaccine is licensed based on all of its ingredients and the exact manufacturing process,” Talaat said. “If you were to take an ingredient out of a vaccine, you would have to start all over with the clinical trials and the manufacturing, and it is highly possible that some of these vaccines wouldn’t work without the aluminium in there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although other adjuvants exist, they are newer and often more scarce than aluminium, which is abundant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An immediate ban on aluminium in vaccines would drastically reduce people’s ability to protect themselves and others against numerous diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think we’d see outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases,” Talaat said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-why-do-people-think-aluminium-in-vaccines-is-causing-autism"&gt;Q: Why do people think aluminium in vaccines is causing autism?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: A 2011 study said vaccines with aluminium adjuvants “may be a significant” contributing factor to the rising number of &lt;a href="/news/2025/9/23/trumps-tylenol-announcement-what-causes-autism-and-is-cuba-autism-free"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; diagnoses in kids, Nature reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year later, a World Health Organization vaccine safety committee called the 2011 study “seriously flawed”. The 2011 study and another by the same authors compared vaccines’ aluminium content and autism rates in several countries, the WHO group said, but that cannot be used to establish a causal relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We studied aluminium, and have no link between aluminium and autism,” Talaat said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 13:52:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQNlYtakI1d2lCT1U2UGF6SVNPcm9pWXBZYk1ZdnlFV0hXcmd2aUdlaHU0a3prUGdaRXkzYUxZQ1U2Qy1ZbjJBUWpnazctYmhEVWIwV213VmRPcW50VFJBbHNEeXhtaGZZOENVU2h1TWpvRVEzbk1zNkY0cmREaUJzX1RjZFhuWmg3MGszWmlxYy1OTlNLbWM5LWxzRk7SAaIBQVVfeXFMTzVZWV8xSEluLS1Zd2pDbjI2dTU0RlF4bUpCdXMyaGxGaXpPVUFaRGNxc254NXkxZmNyM0ZGU1BVSkVodENCRnd0cXNtV3BqaGctcS1TZFNaREg4em1ya1NXNTZUWmZBMlpuTW1nY2Z2SW51N0RXYkJFbEk3UEVYS1RXbFBrcmFIVU9NYkotV05wNE5mZk5EdGhXNWxPLXN5UUpR</guid></item><item><title>断开大脑的一部分使其进入深度睡眠-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03388-8</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03388-8/d41586-025-03388-8_51582210.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03388-8/d41586-025-03388-8_51582210.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Close up view of a young woman asleep in bed." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03388-8/d41586-025-03388-8_51582210.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Surgically severing part of the brain can send the area into a deep sleep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Peter Cade/Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slow, sleep-like brain waves persist in part of the brain that has been surgically disconnected from the rest of the organ even though the person is awake. The findings&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;PLoS Biology&lt;/i&gt;, add to researchers’ understanding of what conscious and unconscious brain states look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children with severe epilepsy who do not respond to medication can undergo a surgical procedure called a hemispherotomy. During surgery, clinicians disconnect the part of the brain in which seizures originate from the rest of the brain, stopping them from spreading. The disconnected tissue is left in the skull and has an intact blood supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team wanted to find out whether the disconnected part has some form of awareness — or was capable of exhibiting consciousness, says co-author Marcello Massimini, a neurophysiology researcher at the University of Milan in Italy. “The question arises because we have no access” to the disconnected region, he says, adding that it was unclear what happens once part of the brain is isolated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies investigating consciousness are difficult because there is no consensus on what conscious and unconscious states in the brain look like, says Ariel Zeleznikow-Johnston, a neuroscientist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. “There’s no generally accepted definitive signatures of consciousness in terms of electrical readings or brain activity,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even defining unconsciousness is challenging, because activities associated with consciousness, such as remembering dreams, can occur during states associated with unconsciousness, such as sleep or anaesthesia, Massimini says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Asleep or awake&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Italy, Australia and the United Kingdom examined electroencephalograms (EEGs) — a test that measures electrical activity in the brain — from ten awake children before they had a hemispherotomy and between six months and three years after the procedure. They compared the recordings with a database of EEGs from children with typical brains that were taken while they were awake or asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that the electrical activity slowed in the disconnected region after surgery, whereas activity in the intact brain did not change. The EEG of the intact region was also similar to EEGs from control children who were awake. After surgery, the disconnected region became dominated by slow rhythms called delta waves and was similar to EEGs taken while control children were in deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The slow pattern persists for months or years after surgery. Massimini says this finding raises questions about its function. The pattern has also been observed in injured parts of the brain among awake people who have had a stroke or traumatic brain injury. It could be protective, involved in maintaining a stable environment in the brain or helping the brain adapt to injury, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state had just passed “the Coronavirus Stop Act” in 2023, which banned nearly all COVID-19 vaccine requirements. If lawmakers did that for COVID-19, Manookian reasoned, they could do the same for all communicable diseases and all medical decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her theory was right, ultimately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bill she penned in the summer of 2024 made it through the Republican-controlled House and Senate in early 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manookian took to social media to rally support for the legislation as it sat on the desk of Gov. Brad Little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the governor vetoed it. &lt;a href="https://gov.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/veto_s-1023aaaa_2025.pdf"&gt;In a letter&lt;/a&gt;, he explained that he saw the bill as government intrusion on “parents’ freedom to ensure their children stay healthy.” During an outbreak, he said, schools wouldn’t be able to send home students “with highly contagious conditions” like measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manookian tried again days after the veto. In the next version of the bill, protections during a disease outbreak applied only to “healthy” people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, Little signed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weeks after the signing, Manookian joined like-minded advocates on a stage in Washington, DC, for a launch event for the MAHA Institute, a group with strong ties to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (MAHA stands for Make America Healthy Again.) The new Health and Human Services secretary had denounced vaccines for years before President Donald Trump appointed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the gathering, Manookian announced her next mission: to make it “a societal norm and to codify it in law” that nobody can dictate any other person’s medical choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to roll that out to other states, and we’re going to make America free again,” Manookian &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/fONtd73sNJg?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=81"&gt;told the audience&lt;/a&gt; in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manookian’s commitment to bring along the rest of the country has continued ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her nonprofit, the Health Freedom Defense Fund, is now distributing &lt;a href="https://healthfreedomdefense.org/resources/"&gt;model legislation and a how-to guide&lt;/a&gt;, with talking points to persuade legislators.

Colorectal &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.aol.com/shopping/health/article/would-you-wear-a-shirt-that-says-colonoscopy-enthusiast-these-cancer-survivors-want-you-to-154214235.html" data-ylk="slk:cancer rates are on the rise;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cancer rates are on the rise&lt;/a&gt;, and inadequate fiber intake is a culprit. Americans often experience the consequences of low fiber intake, such as constipation, bloating, or discomfort. And now that fiber is on everyone’s radar, it has made its social media debut as the latest health trend: fibermaxxing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most health professionals agree that increasing fiber intake is beneficial, too much of a good thing can cause problems. Let’s dive deeper into the fibermaxxing trend, why it’s so popular on social media, and when it can be more hurtful than helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="what-is-fibermaxxing"&gt;What is fibermaxxing?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibermaxxing is just as it sounds: maximizing your daily fiber intake. The goal is to meet or exceed the recommended daily fiber intake to reap health benefits, like improved digestion and more regular bowel movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most healthy adults are advised to eat approximately 14 grams of fiber for every 1,000 calories they eat, or about 25 grams for women and 34 grams for men, according to the most recent &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/resources/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dietary guidelines;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dietary guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But most Americans eat 16 grams per day on average, which is well below the recommended amount. According to &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/candace-pumper" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Candace Pumper;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Candace Pumper&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, low fiber intake is a big problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Colorectal cancer rates have increased among people under the age of 50, and research indicates diets low in fiber are a risk factor,” she says. “Optimizing fiber intake is an important health strategy for reducing their risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-fibermaxxing"&gt;The advantages and disadvantages of fibermaxxing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since low-fiber diets are a concern, fibermaxxing can be beneficial for many Americans. But it’s easy to take a health trend too far. We asked Pumper to explain how fibermaxxing can help Americans increase their fiber intake and point out its disadvantages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="the-advantages-of-fibermaxxing"&gt;The advantages of fibermaxxing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More awareness&lt;/strong&gt;: Because of the fibermaxxing trend, more people are aware of fiber’s role in reducing the risk of certain chronic diseases. “I think more people will become more mindful of their baseline fiber intake and actively work toward improvement,” says Pumper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functional health&lt;/strong&gt;: Many of us rightfully associate fiber intake with certain functional benefits, like digestive movement and regular bathroom visits. Pumper explains that fiber adds bulk to stool, which is important for promoting regular bowel movements and preventing constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physiological health&lt;/strong&gt;: Pumper also explains that fiber promotes physiological benefits through fermentation by the gut microbiome, such as lowering cholesterol, regulating blood sugar, promoting satiety, and reducing inflammation. These benefits are associated with a decreased risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="the-disadvantages-of-fibermaxxing"&gt;The disadvantages of fibermaxxing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bloating and discomfort&lt;/strong&gt;: If you hop on this trend too quickly, Pumper warns that you might not feel as healthy as you thought you would. “Sudden increases in fiber or consuming too much fiber, whether above the recommended daily amount or all at once, may cause bloating, gas, and abdominal discomfort,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not for everyone&lt;/strong&gt;: While most Americans don’t meet fiber intake requirements, some need low-fiber diets on purpose. “Fibermaxxing is not appropriate for everyone, especially those who have been medically advised to follow a low-fiber diet as part of their care,” she says. For example, a doctor may advise a low-fiber diet before a colonoscopy or if someone has active inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could encourage disordered eating&lt;/strong&gt;: Any diet that significantly increases or decreases certain nutrients should be practiced carefully. Pumper explains that fibermaxxing has the potential to affect mental well-being, reinforcing an “all-or-nothing” mindset about eating and weight that can lead to nutritional gaps or digestive issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="how-to-eat-more-fiber-safely"&gt;How to eat more fiber safely&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to increase your fiber intake without upsetting your stomach or causing health issues, consider consulting a healthcare provider, gradually increasing your dietary fiber intake, and diversifying the types of fiber you eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consult your healthcare provider&lt;/strong&gt;: Before making drastic changes to your diet, talk to a healthcare professional about your current health status. If you have a digestive health issue or take certain medications, you may need professional guidance to monitor your nutrition. For example, Pumper advises that older adults and those taking corticosteroids (like prednisone or budesonide) check with their doctor because they may be more sensitive to major dietary changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase fiber intake slowly&lt;/strong&gt;: To avoid bloating, gas, and discomfort, increase your fiber intake by only a few grams per day. Make one or two food swaps, like exchanging crackers for celery sticks with your favorite dip. “Fiber intake should be increased slowly, especially if you are starting below the minimum recommended intake. Also, balance fiber intake with adequate hydration to prevent digestive discomfort,” said Pumper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mix up the types of fiber you eat&lt;/strong&gt;: According to Pumper, the kind of fiber you eat matters because it impacts digestion differently. Soluble fiber (found in oats, legumes, and nuts) slows the digestion process, which is known to support weight loss. Insoluble fiber (found in fruits, veggies, and brown rice) helps you pass stool more easily and regularly. Aim for the right balance of both: about 5–10 grams of soluble fiber and 15–30 grams of insoluble fiber per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="where-to-find-healthy-sources-of-fiber"&gt;Where to find healthy sources of fiber&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many &lt;a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon Canada;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=63045c63-8df1-46e8-bdd0-1716edf6ace5&amp;amp;itemId=amazon_B003CT2YQY&amp;amp;siteId=us-aol&amp;amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;amp;contentUuid=8e9558c4-6e78-46c2-b7a7-0dcb233e07cf&amp;amp;featureId=text-link&amp;amp;merchantName=Amazon+Canada&amp;amp;linkText=fiber+supplements&amp;amp;custData=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&amp;amp;signature=AQAAAc8n1EuuWqvFQ8cLjqs0Qd8opInCsH2eL-ZiRh8CWmXf&amp;amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMetamucil-Multi-Health-Psyllium-Supplement-Sugar-Free%2Fdp%2FB003CT2YQY%2F&amp;amp;spaceId=1197803369" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fiber supplements;elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon Canada;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;fiber supplements&lt;/a&gt; are sold on the market, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4415962/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; says that few offer the right formula to make a difference. The best way to increase fiber intake is through real foods, rather than relying on pills and powders (unless your healthcare provider advises otherwise).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fiber found in real food works alongside vitamins, minerals, and water to deliver benefits to your body. Isolated fiber supplements don’t have other nutrients to help support their role in digestive health, so their benefits can be limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To eat more soluble fiber, try:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oatmeal with limited added sugar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lentils, chickpeas, and beans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flax seeds and sunflower seeds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To eat more insoluble fiber, try:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular and sweet potatoes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apples, berries, and mango&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barley, brown rice, quinoa, and whole wheat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need guidance, talk to your healthcare provider, a dietician, or a nutritionist about the best ways to incorporate more fiber into your diet in a safe and healthy way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this piece — or you just wanna chat about your favorite products you think we should check out — send us an email at &lt;strong&gt;shopping.editors@aol.com&lt;/strong&gt; and we'll write you back!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curious about how we test and choose products at AOL?

Getting back the ability to read is a major improvement in their quality of life, lifts their mood and helps to restore their confidence and independence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The trial found 84% of participants were once again able to read letters, numbers and words after being fitted with the implant, called the Prima device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Eye specialists hailed the results as “remarkable” and said the device could help people with the “dry” form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of sight loss in the over-50s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Moorfields said: “The revolutionary new implant is the first ever device to enable people to read letters, numbers and words through an eye that had lost its sight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The 38 patients all had geographic atrophy with dry AMD, which over time progressively deprives someone of their sight and for which there is no treatment. Most people with the condition lose some of their central vision and in some cases it progresses to full sight loss as the cells in the macula die and the central macula melts away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;All had lost their central vision and had only limited peripheral vision before they had the device implanted in an operation lasting less then two hours. Five were treated at Moorfields and the others at hospitals in Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sheila Wilson from Wiltshire, one of those who had the chip implanted at Moorfields, said: “Before receiving the implant it was like having two black discs in my eyes, with the outside distorted. I was an avid bookworm and I wanted that back. There was no pain during the operation but you’re still aware of what’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s made a big difference. It’s a new way of looking through your eyes and it was dead exciting when I began seeing a letter. It’s not simple, learning to read again, but the more hours I put in, the more I pick up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Prima device, a super-thin microchip that is just 2mm by 2mm in size, is inserted under the centre of the eye’s retina in a procedure known as a vitrectomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;To help them to see and write, patients were given augmented reality glasses containing a video camera connected to a small computer, which they attached to their waistband. It included a zoom feature to make text bigger and easier to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Patients can use the glasses to focus and scan the object in the projected image that they want to read. The glasses project the scenes as an infra-red beam across the chip, which activates the device. Artificial intelligence in the waistband computer processes the information and converts it into an electrical signal, which passes through the cells in the retina and optical nerve into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Muqit stressed that patients had to undergo training and intensive rehabilitation of their eye in order to realise the benefits of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s not like you’re popping a chip in the eye and then you can see again. You need to learn to use this type of vision,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The results of the trial are reported in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 12:29:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxQZWhCalptZS1PYUpfZU9oN0o3OWo4c3JOaFdlSnp2Y2RUZ25CYkk4cm56UWIycVRGaUxmdWpER09HZlpZVDdrR3Zncy1uV08tdGROYlhxZ3dKNGU4WmpVa2lNLTB5NHNHaUpHY3Zyd21haWMxZW1UVEpyQVQ1WFhHczNRdkFBcDFOVGE2RnUxLWpEQWdkS2dqNW1kQWVEdUcxSTBiSDk5U0lKZS1YakJseUlRVnhuVGZ3U0lsLQ</guid></item><item><title>使用假体视网膜植入物恢复视力-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/20/health/retinal-implant-macular-degeneration.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 12:00:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNaVdxLXBMSk9XRmFscElnSnZUZERBam9PNVNENFJrMFA1Q054M0tyWkpRUmRleG9ZNzhxX1FwdWgyVS1sOVpjeDY3NWlOa1E4dDRGRHZLMl9VRUVYeGEwNF85TjhpOVpTUU94bHJDRDhkY1dLUERGUFREczNldWxURmlmUGNaVXA5M3Fr</guid></item><item><title>根据新的饮食指南，每天吃2到3个猕猴桃可以缓解慢性便秘- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/20/health/kiwi-health-benefits-relieve-constipation-wellness</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

In the United States, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7269025/" target="_blank"&gt;9% to 20% of adults&lt;/a&gt; have some form of chronic idiopathic constipation,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in which the cause of the condition&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is unknown.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qeb000j3b6n54hkzesh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/constipation/symptoms-causes/syc-20354253" target="_blank"&gt;symptoms of chronic constipation&lt;/a&gt; include having a bowel movement fewer than three times a week, hard or lumpy stool, or straining or experiencing pain when pooping.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qeb000l3b6n3uiboa2j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The guidelines “introduce foods and drinks (e.g., kiwifruit, prunes, rye bread, high mineral content water) and specific supplement interventions into clinical guidance, filling a long-standing gap between research and routine clinical advice,” lead study author Dr. Eirini Dimidi said in an email. “That will help clinicians give clearer, more targeted, and evidence-informed dietary advice, and will allow people to self-manage their symptoms more effectively.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qeb000m3b6nf4r7xob5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The guidance applies to healthy adults with &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2013/08/28/health/gi-disorders-ibs-cic"&gt;chronic idiopathic constipation&lt;/a&gt; and “did not focus on constipation secondary to other conditions (e.g., neurological disease, pregnancy), so while some recommendations may be applicable, they should be used with caution in these groups, as well as in children,” said Dimidi, an associate professor in nutritional sciences at King’s College London.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qeb000n3b6ngxw8q3z0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The guidelines did not include a general recommendation for increased fiber intake in a patient’s diet. Rather, they focused on specific foods that could be beneficial, Dimidi added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000o3b6nks0tyjjn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Certain &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4059-constipation" target="_blank"&gt;lifestyle choices or situations&lt;/a&gt;, such as low fiber intake, dehydration, lack of exercise, or stress, can cause constipation. As a result, clinicians focus most treatment on dietary changes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000p3b6nkiu9v0bf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Previous dietary advice was broad, such as telling patients to eat more fiber. But these new guidelines, Dimidi said, suggest “incorporating evidence-based foods and drinks in your diet, such as consuming 2-3 kiwifruits a day.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000q3b6nyrl7zt33@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unlike other recommended food such as prunes, kiwifruit is simple to incorporate into your diet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000r3b6nhaw2jqlr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “With kiwifruit, because it’s so well-tolerated, you usually can just step right into that dose, as opposed to prunes, for example, where you want to more gradually work up to that dose of six to eight prunes per day,” said Dr. William Chey, professor and chief of gastroenterology and hepatology at the University of Michigan. He was not involved in the new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000s3b6n5y2tb07c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6267416/" target="_blank"&gt;Kiwis can increase stool bulk&lt;/a&gt; and water content, enhance protein digestion, and smoothen the movement of food, fluids and waste in the digestive tract. The small fruits also improve the amount of time it takes for waste to pass through your intestine and have natural prebiotic effects, such as improved digestion and reduced gut inflammation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000t3b6nmt66pxhb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kiwis are also palatable and soft, which makes them easy to eat, said Dr. Cuckoo Choudhary, the Dorrance H. Hamilton Professor of Medicine at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia. She was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000u3b6nh9jy0heg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            You can also eat a kiwi’s skin or peel, which has extra fiber. But avoid heating a kiwi, since high temperatures destroy the enzyme that smoothens gut movement, Choudhary added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000v3b6nmkmvq1n0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Foods such as prunes, rye bread, flaxseeds, oranges, yogurt, beans and oatmeal &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/05/18/health/foods-for-constipation"&gt;can also help&lt;/a&gt; with chronic constipation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000w3b6ncyd4t6et@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For those who like dairy, you could “take a cup of yogurt, make it 8 ounces, any yogurt of your choice because all yogurts have probiotics, and take a heaped tablespoon full of crushed flaxseeds,” said Choudhary, an expert with the American Gastroenterological Association.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000x3b6n9ozxl3ub@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other alternatives include dietary supplements, such as &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/18922-psyllium-powder-for-solution" target="_blank"&gt;psyllium&lt;/a&gt;, which helps your intestine move stool along and reduces your body’s cholesterol absorption from food.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000y3b6n2x0au123@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That dosage is at least 10 grams of fiber per day. And again, the general rule is, start low and go slow. So start with 3 grams and gradually work your way up to 10 plus grams per day of psyllium to achieve the benefits,” said Chey, incoming president of the American College of Gastroenterology.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000z3b6nt9lvzh94@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11583288/" target="_blank"&gt;Physical activity&lt;/a&gt; is also an important lifestyle change that patients with chronic constipation can incorporate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec00103b6n7ov5pipc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even something as simple as walking&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;increases the effectiveness of the digestive tract&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;Choudhary said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec00113b6npxjdgcii@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new recommendations were based on findings of four systematic reviews and meta-analyses that looked at over 75 randomized controlled trials of dietary interventions for chronic constipation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

In Asia, the flu has made an early comeback, and quickly swelled to epidemic proportions in Japan and Taiwan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And stateside, some experts are sounding the alarm about continued lower uptake of the flu vaccine. There’s also the possibility of a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-09-03/as-covid-wave-washes-over-california-some-health-officials-urge-residents-to-mask-up"&gt;seasonal COVID-19 wave&lt;/a&gt; — the likes of which didn’t materialize last winter, but had been commonplace since the pandemic — as well as a simultaneous rise in &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-11-22/what-to-know-about-the-new-rsv-shot-for-babies"&gt;respiratory syncytial virus&lt;/a&gt;, or RSV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California health officials have previously &lt;a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/JfEbRVAvIys?si=Kh5upr2sXpQFulQk&amp;amp;t=354" target="_blank"&gt;forecast&lt;/a&gt; that this fall-and-winter’s respiratory virus season is expected to be similar to last year’s. If that’s the case, flu would again be the dominant virus fueling hospital admissions compared to COVID-19 and RSV. During the winters of 2022-23 and 2023-24, COVID made up the majority of California hospital admissions caused by respiratory viruses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having people get vaccinated is going to be really key for influenza,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UC San Francisco infectious diseases expert. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While flu, COVID and RSV are currently at low levels in California, there are signs that respiratory virus season is starting to gear up as temperatures drop and people spend more time indoors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to rates recorded in the summer, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has seen increases in people reporting cough, fever, chills, aches, sore throat and runny nose, officials said, citing a text-based health &lt;a class="link" href="https://ph.lacounty.gov/acd/respwatch/#Angelenos" target="_blank"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;. The test positivity rate for rhinoviruses and enteroviruses, which typically cause the common cold, is 19.87%. That’s higher than that of the virus that causes COVID-19, 4.2%; or the flu, 1.04%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In San Francisco, doctors have seen the number of colds being reported in the hospital double, Chin-Hong said. Some workplaces in the Bay Area have seen a number of employees call out sick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With RSV, flu and COVID-19 rates expected to climb by the holidays, “this is a perfect time to get immunized,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fall and winter of 2024-25 brought the nation’s &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2025-2026-influenza-activity.html#:~:text=The%20Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control,of%20the%202024%E2%80%9325%20season" target="_blank"&gt;worst&lt;/a&gt; flu season in many years, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of children who died from flu last season was the highest since the H1N1 swine flu pandemic season of 2009-10, according to a recent &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; published in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Officials reported 280 confirmed deaths among children last season, and about 9 in 10 of those kids were not vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials became particularly concerned about reports of a rare, severe complication that targets the brain — influenza-associated encephalopathy, or &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;IAE&lt;/a&gt;, which was reported in 109 children nationally last season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three in four children with IAE needed intensive care treatment. The median age of children with IAE was 5, and 55% of those diagnosed with the condition had no underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of those children, 37 had acute necrotizing encephalopathy, or ANE, a particularly severe form of the disease that results in rapid neurologic decline. Two in five children with ANE died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 1 in 6 of the kids with IAE who were eligible to be vaccinated had gotten the flu shot, health officials say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC recommends that everyone age 6 months and up get a flu vaccine. New this year, officials are allowing people to order &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-nasal-spray-influenza-vaccine-self-or-caregiver-administration" target="_blank"&gt;FluMist&lt;/a&gt; to be mailed to them at home. FluMist is approved for people ages 2 through 49 and administered by nasal spray rather than injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors have been concerned about declining flu vaccination levels. As of late April, just 49.2% of children had gotten a flu shot, lower than the 53.4% who had done so at the same point the previous season, according to preliminary national &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;survey results&lt;/a&gt;. Both figures are much lower than the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/interactive/general-population-coverage.html" target="_blank"&gt;final flu vaccination rate&lt;/a&gt; for vaccine-eligible children during the 2019-20 season, which was 63.7%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among adults, 46.7% had gotten their flu shot, slightly down from the 47.4% at the same point last season, according to the preliminary survey results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before the COVID-19 pandemic, flu vaccination coverage had been slowly increasing; downturns in coverage occurred during and after the pandemic. Flu vaccination levels have not rebounded to pre-pandemic levels,” the CDC &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early data from the Southern Hemisphere indicate that the flu shot’s effectiveness was decent this season — cutting the risk of &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a3.htm?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank"&gt;hospitalization&lt;/a&gt; by 50%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asia is already reporting plenty of flu cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For influenza right now, it’s raging in Asia,” Chin-Hong said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu is considered to be at epidemic levels in &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/16071642" target="_blank"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; — where news reports say this was the second-earliest start to the season in 20 years — and in Taiwan. Hong Kong health officials have described the flu situation in September and October, before shots became widely available, as “&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3329312/hong-kong-faces-relatively-severe-summer-flu-outbreak-health-authorities-warn" target="_blank"&gt;relatively severe&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation there could provide a glimpse of how the flu season will play out in California and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the San Francisco Bay Area, officials are also closely monitoring “high” levels in wastewater of a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-09-14/la-oc-health-departments-warn-about-enterovirus-ev-d68"&gt;specific kind of cold virus&lt;/a&gt; — enterovirus D68, or EV-D68. In rare cases, that virus can cause polio-like paralysis in children called acute flaccid myelitis, or AFM. High levels were reported in a large swath of the Silicon Valley and San Francisco, according to &lt;a class="link" href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/?charts=CjEQACABSABaBUVWRDY4cgoyMDI1LTA5LTA1cgoyMDI1LTEwLTE3igEGNTY3MWZjwAEB&amp;amp;selectedChartId=5671fc&amp;amp;plantId=c8d357b9&amp;amp;target=EVD68&amp;amp;selectedLocation=%7B%22label%22%3A%22San%20Jose,%20CA%22,%22level%22%3A%22plant%22,%22value%22%3A%22c8d357b9%22%7D" target="_blank"&gt;WastewaterSCAN&lt;/a&gt;. High levels have also been found in sewage in western San Bernardino County, including Ontario, Chino and Fontana. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The L.A. County Department of Public Health has not yet detected increased signals of EV-D68, and no cases of AFM have been reported this year in Los Angeles or Orange counties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That virus can transmit through an infected person’s saliva and mucus and likely spreads “when an infected person coughs, sneezes or touches a surface that is then touched by others,” the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents should call a doctor if their child suffers any symptoms of &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/about/about-enterovirus-d68.html" target="_blank"&gt;AFM&lt;/a&gt;, which include slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, difficulty moving the eyes, drooping eyelids, pain in the neck, back, arms or legs, weakness in the arm or legs or facial droop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To protect yourself against respiratory viruses, experts recommend getting vaccinated, washing your hands often, keeping rooms well-ventilated, wearing face masks in crowded indoor public settings, and staying away from sick people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Public Health &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/publichealth4all/vaccines.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; updated COVID-19 vaccines for everyone age 6 months to 23 months, seniors age 65 and up; as well as older children, teenagers and adults who either have risk factors for severe COVID, or are in close contact with at-risk people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children who have never been inoculated against COVID-19 should also get the vaccine, as should pregnant women and anyone else who wants to get the shot, the state says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RSV immunizations are recommended for everyone age 75 and up, babies younger than 8 months, and pregnant women between 32 weeks to 36 weeks of gestation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immunizations are also recommended for adults age 50 to 74 with risk factors, as well as babies with risk factors between 8 months and 19 months. Older adults who have been previously immunized against RSV generally don’t need to get another vaccine, according to current guidelines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxQWnVtWDhxeTRmMC0zT2l1TzNkSFpJR3NCQi1QcFhwMENFQjVpUFBhTDVadFg5M3RNYmRwSjFKbEgzZTdUeHp5dm0tRE9MbGpWRWotUmJYeC1ReWxrZjN2d2c0QUdVNlRkenBJc0M1RnREeU5hVUdfc2lPd0h1cy1IaFkzSjRYRTVOQms1d1pOUzdSR1FQQWJ0U1dYWG90OS14</guid></item><item><title>Sadhguru透露，晚上半勺这种油可以自然地清洁结肠-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/sadhguru-reveals-that-half-a-spoon-of-this-oil-at-night-can-cleanse-the-colon-naturally/articleshow/124702897.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lifestyle we live, many of us will face struggles with sluggishness, poor digestion, or a general feeling of heaviness. According to Sadhguru, these issues often trace back to one simple factor: an unclean colon. He emphasises that a clean system is essential for staying alert, vibrant, and full of life. And surprisingly, the key to achieving this might already be sitting quietly in the kitchen, castor oil, a remedy rooted in South Indian tradition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The connection between colon cleanliness and vitality&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadhguru explains that the body’s vibrancy is deeply connected to the state of the colon. When waste matter stays longer than it should, it affects not just digestion but also energy levels and mental clarity. The body begins to carry an “inertia,” a sense of dullness that weighs down both physical and emotional wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Cure 90% of Diseases by Fixing Just TWO Things – Sadhguru Reveals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping the colon clean, he says, allows the system to stay light and the mind alert. It’s not merely about detox; it’s about maintaining balance between the body’s natural processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Sadhguru recommends castor oil&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In southern India, castor oil has long been used as a natural cleanser. Sadhguru refers to it as a simple, almost magical, element for maintaining inner cleanliness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to him, taking half a spoon of warm castor oil mixed with water or milk at night can help naturally cleanse the colon while supporting the lymphatic system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lymphatic system plays a crucial role in removing toxins and maintaining immune health. When this system becomes sluggish, toxins accumulate, leading to fatigue and dullness. Castor oil, being mildly laxative and anti-inflammatory, can help keep this system active and the body free from unnecessary stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How it works: Activating the body’s natural flow&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadhguru highlights that the body’s vitality depends on how freely energy and fluids move within. When the colon and lymphatic systems work efficiently, energy circulates better. Castor oil, in this context, is not a “quick fix” but a supportive aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its natural compounds stimulate gentle bowel movement, clear out residual waste, and reduce internal heaviness. Over time, this helps in keeping the body lighter, reducing sluggishness, and improving overall alertness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;An ancient practice, not a trend&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike modern detox fads, this method is not about extremes or strict diets. It’s about reconnecting with a traditional understanding of the body, something that has guided Indian wellness practices for centuries. Castor oil has been used in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ayurveda" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Ayurveda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; for cleansing and healing, but Sadhguru’s approach simplifies it for daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He reminds that a body free from internal clutter functions better, not just physically but mentally too. The mind becomes clearer, and the sense of vitality returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Sadhguru’s words, “Colon not being clean and the inability to be vibrant are very related.” This small, mindful practice of taking warm castor oil at night, he suggests, can be a gentle step toward keeping the body clean and the mind awake. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the simplest habits rooted in tradition hold the most profound benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is based on Sadhguru’s teachings and traditional wellness practices.

&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been doing it all my life. I gotta see for myself,” he said. “But as far as trying to make a living, you can’t do it, not any more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mansi converted his lobster wholesale facility on the dock in Guilford into a restaurant in the early 2000s. In the upstairs office on a sunny September morning, there are a few reminders of the life he used to lead: a “Captain’s Quarters” sign, framed photos from his lobstering heyday, the mast of his son’s fishing boat swaying gently out the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His eyes lit up as he recalled the good days. “We saw a lot of lobsters, a real lot of lobsters,” Mansi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-iLgdKCFX" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_iLgdKCFX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(Dana Edwards / CT Mirror)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s and ’90s, &lt;a href="https://www.guilfordlobsterpound.com/"&gt;Mansi&lt;/a&gt; was making a killing, along with the roughly 1,200 commercial lobstermen on Long Island Sound. The Sound was the third most-productive lobster fishery in the country, with 10 million pounds of lobster landings at its peak in 1998, including 3.8 million pounds in Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the fall of 1999, lobstermen pulled up traps filled with limp, sickly lobsters, and soon after, hardly any lobsters at all. It was an unprecedented mortality event, and the lobster population never recovered. Connecticut saw only 181,000 pounds of lobster landings in 2024, less than 5% of the 1998 peak. Now most seafood restaurants in the state — including Mansi’s — import lobster from Maine or Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catastrophic die-off is still an emotional subject for Mansi and so many former lobstermen. In addition to the painful memory of losing their livelihoods practically overnight, resentment lingers about how it happened. The scientific &lt;a href="https://portal.ct.gov/ceq/ar-23-gold/2023-ceq-annual-report-ebook/water-quality---rivers-lakes-and-estuaries/warming-and-rising-waters-of-long-island-sound"&gt;consensus is that warming waters,&lt;/a&gt; and an epidemic of a crustacean disease called paramoebiasis, were the primary culprits — and that pesticides used to combat West Nile virus may have had an additional effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;a href="https://portal.ct.gov/deep/fishing/fisheries-management/lobster-assessment"&gt;catastrophe was complex and unprecedented&lt;/a&gt;, and not all scientists agree on which factors were the most significant. The lobstermen almost unanimously blame the pesticides, and they feel betrayed by the chemical manufacturers, the marine scientists, and the government — whose tightening regulations they resented and whose financial assistance they found inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;In the early 2000s, as they fought for accountability and answers, the lobstermen had no choice but to adapt to the new reality. Some switched to fishing, clamming or catching conch, but most sold their boats and left the fishing docks behind entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there are no full-time commercial lobstermen left in Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are still a few part-timers. In the southeasternmost corner of the state, the Stonington port is home to seven active lobster boats. Other than one boat in New London, Stonington is the last bastion of commercial lobstering in Connecticut. Roddy Grimshaw is one of the few in Stonington still at it, a man of 29 who goes lobstering with his dad and a small crew a few days a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just lobstering that’s in decline — all forms of commercial fishing are under threat as luxury development supplants the docks once home to a vibrant blue-collar fishing culture.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Grimshaw put it this way: “The way I see it, if we don’t stay active … this will become just another yacht club.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The heyday&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mansi has fond memories of fishing with his family as a kid growing up in East Haven in the late 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just loved being out on the water, the freedom,” he said. At that time, the Connecticut lobster industry was picking up steam after a decades-long lull around the turn of the century. His dad wasn’t a lobsterman, more of a recreational fisherman, but, eyeing the hauls of lobstermen down at the docks, he decided to give it a shot. He started working on a friend’s father’s lobster boat while he was in high school in the 1970s. Then, in 1983, he bought his own boat, the Jani M.— named after his wife — and went into business for himself. And business was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you left the dock, you knew you were gonna catch lobsters. It was exciting. You’re dying to pull that first trap to see what was in it. And, you know, they were almost always full,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the ’80s and ’90s, Mansi was landing up to 100,000 pounds per year on just his boat, over 50% of the state’s entire 2024 haul. At a market price of $3 per pound, he was making a killing. He also started the Guilford Lobster Pound, a wholesaler that bought lobster from other fishermen and sold it to Connecticut retailers and restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mansi described a vibrant waterfront community at the Guilford Marina and at fishing docks across the state. He pointed to a newspaper article framed on his wall, which told the story of a fellow Guilford lobsterman who suffered a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We got six lobstermen all together, and we ended up going out and pulling all his gear. We brought all his lobsters to the pound here, we sold his lobsters, and we gave him a check. We all stuck together,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mansi wasn’t the only one to turn a high school lobstering job into a lucrative career in those years. Some 30 miles down the Sound in Norwalk, Gary Whetmore grew up lobstering with his dad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My father lobstered on a very small scale, and then I got into it on a much bigger scale,” Whetmore said. “I remember swapping lobsters with a gym teacher to get out of classes.”&lt;/p&gt;

“It was fun. It wasn’t work. The money was great, but it was the freedom of it. You could make as much or as little as you wanted to make. And if you worked hard enough, you could have anything you want in the world,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might think that the accelerating lobster hauls in those days — a roughly six-fold increase in Connecticut from the 1970s to the 1990s — risked depleting the lobster population. Counterintuitively, the reverse was true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There were a lot of lobsters,” Whetmore continued, “but it wasn’t natural.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecticut lobstermen from that era describe their work not as catching lobsters but, rather, “farming”  them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We were feeding them and letting them go,” Whetmore said. Indeed, in the ’80s and ’90s, lobstermen were stuffing millions of pounds of bait fish — pogy, mackerel, and others — into tens of thousands of traps in Long Island Sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The influx of bait represented a huge supplement to the lobsters’ natural food sources, artificially increasing the population to levels never before seen in the Sound. It was great for business, but scientists say the crowded crustacean conditions on the seafloor, combined with the unnaturally young population — lobstermen harvested them as soon as they reached the minimum size required by regulation — likely left them more vulnerable to the disease that decimated the population in the late ’90s. It was the boom before the bust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was not sustainable. Something was going to give,” Whetmore said. “There were no big lobsters here. As soon as they were legal, we harvested them. We’re feeding them, we’re growing them, and we’re harvesting, and whoever worked the hardest harvested the most. And that’s as simple as it was.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was really, really good, and when it ended, it ended,” Whetmore said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mansi spoke of the sudden die-off with a similar sense of finality. “You go out there one day, and that’s it. Overnight, it was done. It was ended,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The die-off&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the years leading up to the widespread die-off in the fall of 1999, there were early signs of trouble. Two localized lobster mortality events occurred in the &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287002284_The_1999_Long_Island_Sound_Lobster_mortality_event_Findings_of_the_Comprehensive_Research_Initiative"&gt;western Sound, f&lt;/a&gt;rom Norwalk to Greenwich, in 1997 and 1998.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whetmore, just a few miles further east, took heed of those early warnings. “I heard about the die-off getting as far up as Greenwich in ’98. And I told my guys that were working for me: If it happens next year, and it comes this way, we’re done. And sure enough, it got here,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 1999, dead lobsters started washing up on beaches along the Sound. On Sept. 16, Tropical Storm Floyd hit the region, dumping up to 12 inches of rain into the Sound in just two days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the following week, Long Island Sound’s lobster industry practically collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A week after the storm, when I went out, the lobsters in the pots were nothing but goo. It smelled. It was nothing but lobster parts,” said Tony Carlo, a Darien lobsterman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287002284_The_1999_Long_Island_Sound_Lobster_mortality_event_Findings_of_the_Comprehensive_Research_Initiative"&gt;Western Sound was hit the hardest,&lt;/a&gt; that fall experiencing a 99% reduction in lobster landings compared to the previous year. Ports in the east of the Sound saw reductions of 64% to 91%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, neither the lobstermen nor marine scientists had a clear understanding of the cause. A New York Times headline on Oct. 18, 1999, read, “Scientists Are Mystified by Deaths Of Lobsters in Long Island.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was a suspicious coincidence. In August, just a month before the storm, the government began applying pesticides, including resmethrin and methoprene, across Connecticut and New York to curb the spread of West Nile Virus. Because lobsters are related to insects, which the pesticides were designed to kill, many suspected that the runoff from the storm poisoned the lobsters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2000, a “commercial fishery failure” was declared in the Sound, and the federal government authorized $13.9 million to provide economic relief for the lobstermen and to fund research into the causes of the disaster. Over 20 research projects across a slew of institutions and agencies were approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the studies concluded by 2004, a clearer picture emerged. A parasitic amoeba, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8145359/"&gt;Neoparamoeba pemaquidensis,&lt;/a&gt; had infected and killed the lobsters. But it wasn’t just the disease. Researchers referred to a &lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/2017/03/16/proposals-aim-to-restore-lobsters-to-long-island-sound/"&gt;“perfect storm” of contributing factors.&lt;/a&gt; Years of above-average water temperatures weakened the immune systems of the lobsters, which are extremely sensitive to temperature increases. The storm may have accelerated the die-off by churning up the waters, bringing warmer temperatures to the already sick lobsters. Furthermore, the unnaturally high and primarily juvenile population was particularly vulnerable to infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you have a bunch of young animals all together, just like a cold in a classroom at school, the disease spreads through them pretty quickly,” said biologist Nancy Balcom, associate director of Connecticut Sea Grant, who was involved in research after the die-off and published several articles summarizing the findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the decades since 1999, the lobster population would appear to rebound in some years with a new crop of juvenile lobsters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But then a few years later, you didn’t see the adults,” Balcom said. This is consistent with the finding that the water is just getting too warm for the lobsters to tolerate, even though the paramoebiosis epidemic has passed. Long Island Sound has historically been the southernmost tip of the inshore range of the American lobster. With global warming, that map is being redrawn, and their range may soon terminate in Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The pesticides&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of the pesticides loomed large immediately after the die-off. Toxicology testing and several modeling exercises were conducted, but even the “worst case scenario” model indicated that the concentration of the chemicals never reached lethal levels for the lobsters. The scientific consensus is that the pesticides were not the primary cause of the die-off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That consensus, however, is not ironclad, and most of the lobstermen don’t buy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The pesticides are what killed them,” Mansi said. “We actually see what’s going on. We were there, and we’re telling you what we saw. They [the scientists] have never been on the water, they just sit in a lab and they make up these models that we have to adhere to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing of the pesticide application and the storm runoff was uncanny, and the lobstermen observed strange, hyperactive behavior in some living lobsters they caught after the die-off, as well as in certain species of crabs. Mansi helped recruit a biologist the lobstermen considered one of their own, Dr. Robert Bayer of Maine’s Lobster Institute. Bayer came down to Connecticut, performed his own tests, and concluded that the lobsters hauled alive during the 1999 event “showed the behaviors, classic behaviors, of pesticide poisoning — which is hyperactivity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the months and years that followed, while the government-funded studies were still underway, the lobstermen initiated a class action lawsuit against Cheminova and other pesticide makers, eventually receiving two settlements, for $12.5 million and $3.75 million. The lobstermen see the settlement as a vindication of their hypothesis, while Balcom says the pesticide makers never admitted to causing the die-off and merely settled to make the lawsuit go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the pesticides were the primary cause of death, they would have received probably lots more money,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarsila Seara, a social scientist who studies fishing communities, views the science as less settled, and she understands the animosity Mansi and many other lobstermen still feel towards the biologists, the pesticide companies and the government. In 2019, while a professor at the University of New Haven, she interviewed 20 former lobstermen and published two papers about the social impacts of the die-off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was a dismissal of their experience and the knowledge that the fishermen were trying to bring to the table,” Seara said. “It should have been dealt with differently.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The reality is that it was a very complex combination of factors, and the lobstermen really wanted to find the one thing that they could blame, and they were naturally upset because there was no backing of that one culprit,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tony Carlo and Roger Frate, cousins who started lobstering in the 1970s in central Connecticut, were active in the fight against the pesticide companies in the early 2000s. Frate now runs the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/darienseafood/"&gt;Darien Seafood Market&lt;/a&gt; with Carlo’s help. Alongside tanks with live lobsters (now imported from Maine or Canada), the store has multiple display cases with newspaper articles documenting the die-off and ensuing legal battles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two cousins are still angry at the chemical makers, politicians and marine scientists they see as responsible for causing — or failing to address — the destruction of their livelihood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We lost everything within a three-week period,” Carlo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We fought in Washington, Hartford, Boston … we fought against some big people at the chemical companies. We kept going for years and years,” Frate said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frate and Carlo see the government’s regulatory response in the 2000s — mandating an increase in “gauge” size (a device used to measure the minimum-sized lobsters legal to catch), as well as a 90-day moratorium imposed on lobstering from early September to early December — as harmful and misguided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“From beginning to end, it seemed like they were always against us, to slow us down one way or another,” Carlo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They argued for years that the real culprit was toxicity from the pesticides, as well as an accumulation of other pollutants from decades of runoff into the Sound. They asked for money to “clean up” the Sound and more financial support for the struggling lobstermen. But their pleas fell on deaf ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frate and Carlo hold a litany of grudges against the Connecticut and New York politicians of that era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Schumer would never call us back … Blumenthal’s telling lies … Chris Shays, that piece of shit. You got your money. The state got their money. Now the fisheries’ money’s not there,” Frate said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frate and Carlo did eventually collect checks from the pesticide maker settlements. “But it wasn’t about the money,” Carlo said. “We’d give it all back to them if they could give us back Long Island Sound. We want our lobster back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A difficult adjustment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seara, the social scientist, understands the animosity towards the government in the years following the die-off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They were not being supported when they were going through something that was very impactful, very traumatic,” she said. “Some of the programs the government put in place were not well received. They didn’t seem to make sense to a lot of the fishermen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, there were some experiments with lobster trap buyback programs, which paid lobstermen to recover the thousands of abandoned pots littering the seafloor. In September, these programs received a $1.8 million boost of federal funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other programs included various job retraining efforts, which lobstermen like Mansi scoff at to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They said, ‘We’ll train you.’ Well, there’s no retraining. You don’t take a guy that’s been fishing on the water all his life and retrain him to go work in an office. It’s something that you can’t do,” Mansi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What made the prospect of retraining particularly unappealing is that, for so many lobstermen, lobstering is not just a job but a deeply held identity and beloved lifestyle. Seara, along with her mentor, Professor Richard Pollnac, have studied fishing communities across the world, and they’ve found that self-employed fishermen experience some of the highest levels of job satisfaction of any workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s the freedom, being out in the water, being close to nature, and some aspects that are thrilling. It’s a gamble, right? You’re out there, you don’t know what you’re going to get. Every day is different. You have encounters with nature, whales, and beautiful sunsets, and, on top of it, this adventure and this challenge, and this camaraderie,” Seara said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A fisherman once put it to me like this: ‘What other profession in the world do you know that people pay to do over the weekend?’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each lobsterman took their own path after the die-off. Some turned to clamming or catching conch, but most couldn’t find a way to support themselves on the water. Many struggled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We had a lot of guys who became alcoholics or drug addicts,” Mansi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We had to move on,” Mansi said. “I am still bitter about what happened, because not only did they wipe out an industry, they wiped out a way of life,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mansi turned his lobster pound on the docks in Guilford into a seasonal restaurant. He considers himself lucky, as he’s still able to work down by the water, and his son runs a fishing boat out of the same port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlo initially got a job doing manual labor down at the docks in Norwalk for $10 an hour, “just to do something and stay near the water,” but it didn’t pay the bills. He was forced to find a new career, so he started a landscaping business, which he still runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Landscaping, being on land … I hated it. Hated it. I hate it to this day,” Carlo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the few who seemed to transition smoothly was Whetmore. Immediately after the die-off, he got into marine construction, and he now runs a successful business out of Norwalk, G&amp;amp;C Marine, which primarily builds residential docks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whetmore was included in Seara’s 2019 study; notably, he was the sole lobsterman out of the 20 interviewed who said they believe that warming waters and the disease were to blame for the die-off. Even his own son insists it was the pesticides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can’t argue the numbers. You know, the bottom temperature, it’s there,” Whetmore said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He attributes his ability to adapt — and his acceptance of immovable forces like global warming — to a feeling that he is lucky to be alive. In the last two decades, he’s had two kidney transplants, cancer and multiple heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stonington’s working docks smell like diesel and bait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a sunny September afternoon, a flock of gulls circled the docks as the Lady Lynn cruised into the harbor — 42 feet of scuffed fiberglass, stacked with crusty lobster traps. The Lady Lynn is one of seven lobster boats still operating out of Stonington, the last commercial lobster fleet in Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roddy Grimshaw was on deck with his crew, Ian Crimm and Bubba Dolith, his 10-month-old puppy, Bailey, who ran back and forth excitedly, and his dad, Mike, who bought the Lady Lynn back in the ’70s. They were in a rush to haul out all their traps before Sept. 7, when the season closed for 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After unloading all the traps into massive stacks on the dock, Grimshaw took a breather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I’m on the boat, I’m always active, doing something like hauling lobsters, driving the boat, hauling the gear, seeing interesting things. I just, I love it, and I love to tan,” he said, laughing. Grimshaw showed off a new tattoo of a lobster on his very tan forearm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s been a good year,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grimshaw was averaging 160 lobsters (totaling about 200 pounds) each time he pulled traps. Though it’s a far cry from the quadruple digits his dad used to haul back in the ’90s, it’s an improvement from last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not a coincidence that the last remnants of the state’s lobster industry are located in Stonington. Just outside of Long Island Sound, only a few miles from the Rhode Island border, the area has somewhat cooler water, and its fishery wasn’t hit as hard by the die-off in the ’90s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, Grimshaw lobsters two to three days per week and the rest of the week goes out “dragging” for fish — flounder, whiting, sea bass and others. But lobstering is his true love, and he’d like to dedicate himself to it full-time, though he says the catch is just too variable to rely on. His eyes lit up when he considered the possibility. “It’s a big, big idea, and it would be so great,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of his other struggles is fetching a reasonable price for the lobsters he lands. Lobster imported from Maine and Canada for roughly $3 per pound dominate the market, which just isn’t enough to cover his costs. So he sells directly to the public on the docks in addition to selling to wholesalers who are willing to pay about $7 per pound, this year’s going rate for Connecticut lobsters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His crew members, Crimm, 18 and Dolith, 19, kidded around as they fixed up the engine and organized tools. They’re new to working with Grimshaw, who recently had to replace his entire crew after he discovered that one was drinking on the job, and the other was a registered sex offender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crimm and Dolith love the work, even though Grimshaw can give them a hard time. Neither of them has had what they’d consider a “normal” job — they’ve bounced between farming and other forms of manual labor — and they want to keep working on the Lady Lynn as long as there are lobster to be caught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not a normal 9-to-5, which I hate. I can’t do them,” Dolith said while pulling up lobster pots hanging off the side of the Lady Lynn in the harbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their boss, Grimshaw, plans to take over his dad’s lobstering license in January. At 29, as the youngest active commercial lobster captain in the state, he’ll represent both the next generation and the last of the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grimshaw understands the weight of his position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s not many other people here that does it, that wants to do it,” Grimshaw said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He pointed to a seafood restaurant and yacht club visible in the distance. “If this harbor wasn’t here, it wouldn’t make a difference to the tourists and out-of-town people. And I just don’t want to see that,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I want to continue,” he said. “I don’t see myself doing something different.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whetmore expressed a similar unease with the luxury development and tourism taking over the waterfront that used to be home to so many fishing and working docks. While walking around his construction yard in Norwalk one August afternoon, he pointed to the neighboring lots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There were oil tankers on this river. There were fishermen going down the river. Now it’s condos and rowing clubs. It’s definitely changing. It’s been very gentrified.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Norwalk Planning &amp;amp; Zoning Commission just approved a 59-unit mixed-use complex, with luxury apartments and a boardwalk, on the property adjacent to Whetmore’s construction yard. He said the town government has applied enormous pressure on him to move his business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In town after town along the Sound, the working waterfront is giving way to luxury housing and recreation. A 2022 mid-Atlantic fisheries briefing flagged “persistent trends toward gentrification of working waterfronts,” noting that the loss of maritime space can upend the cultural identity of fishing communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They don’t want equipment like this. They need us when we build their docks, their yacht clubs, their rowing clubs, and they love us when we’re building them, but they don’t want to see us,” Whetmore said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was a community, a waterfront community, and that’s gone,” he said. “That way of life is gone.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3bwy8004x26p33s686c16@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Big Cities Health Coalition is the latest group to take a strong public stand in support of vaccination as a direct response to concerns that the federal government is limiting access and raising doubts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h00043b6nbu1oeq9v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are united behind a simple message: get vaccinated,” the group wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.bigcitieshealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VaxMemberStatement.October2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; that was published Monday. It was signed by two dozen public health leaders from some of the nation’s largest cities, in both Democrat- and Republican-led states.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h00053b6nl9ia75m4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccination has saved millions of lives, they wrote, but falling vaccination rates across the country have led to more frequent outbreaks of devastating diseases such as measles and polio. They also referenced the “rapidly approaching” respiratory virus season, which brings a heavy wave of Covid-19 and flu infections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h00063b6n692ikxoo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are deeply troubled by the repeated false claims about vaccines from too many federal officials, which have contributed directly to these trends,” the public health leaders wrote. “We are equally concerned about recent changes to the recommended childhood and adult immunization schedules that unnecessarily limit access to vaccines.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h00073b6nf1v8b1x9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/18/health/cdc-vaccine-panel-acip-mmrv-hepatitis"&gt;voted&lt;/a&gt; last month to recommend against the combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) vaccine for children younger than 4, and a new working group will convene to more broadly assess the safety, effectiveness and timing of the shots children and adolescents get, as well as whether &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/health/cdc-acip-vaccine-working-group"&gt;the schedule should be changed&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h00083b6nws1wzadu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And at a recent Cabinet meeting, President Donald Trump made &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/politics/fact-check-trump-cabinet-meeting"&gt;numerous false claims&lt;/a&gt; about vaccines given to children, including about the size of vaccine doses and that babies get 82 vaccines in a single shot.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h00093b6ni88031zx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As vaccination becomes increasingly politicized, city health officials say, they felt a need to speak up to protect their communities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h000a3b6nkcrasbhy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have to make our public health decisions based on data and not on political ideology,” said Dr. Phil Huang, director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department. “We have to be the voices for that science and reason.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h000b3b6nz8gc5wnq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Multiple major medical organizations – including the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/health/covid-vaccine-recommendation-aap"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/22/health/covid-vaccine-pregnancy-acog-recommendations"&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt; – have broken from the CDC on vaccine guidance. And new &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/03/health/west-coast-states-health-guidance"&gt;public health organizations have formed&lt;/a&gt; in recent months with an aim to safeguard public health amid turmoil at the federal level.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h000c3b6nei209twu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Big Cities Health Coalition, with members representing about a fifth of the US population, has been working together to exchange ideas and address public health threats for more than two decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h000d3b6ntp7e7jrx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the “threats are growing and becoming more complicated,” said Dr. Raynard Washington, director of public health for Mecklenburg County, North Carolina – including from the federal government.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h000e3b6nbyrgn33k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s a lot of conversation happening about how, in the absence of a strong federal public health system, we are able to navigate and ensure that we continue to protect public safety,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h000f3b6nc0d3srv7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Consistency is important in public health, and the federal structure helped facilitate that, he said. But in the absence of that, coordination becomes key.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h000g3b6neg1xv8cc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A measles outbreak is growing quickly in the upstate region of South Carolina, just about 100 miles from Charlotte.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h000h3b6n4uaazu5o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I don’t have any walls to put up to keep folks from Mecklenburg going into South Carolina, or people from South Carolina going into Mecklenburg County,” Washington said. “So as a country, our local public health system is only as strong as the weakest county or jurisdiction. There is an importance of ensuring that we work collaboratively, because the boundaries that we actually exist in are only administrative.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h000i3b6nddo8hb7b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than 100 unvaccinated students in South Carolina are in quarantine because of a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/health/measles-outbreaks-utah-arizona-south-carolina"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; exposure in school – one of the many reasons why Big Cities Health Coalition emphasizes the importance of vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h000j3b6n5jwp5t09@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccines “keep classrooms safe and schools open. They allow children to spend time with friends and enjoy their favorite activities. They help parents and caregivers work to support their families,” the organizations wrote in the new letter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h000k3b6n2x7kd6j3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Trust also plays a key role in public health, experts say, and city health leaders want to provide reassurance to their communities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h000l3b6ndhg188u9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “CDC has been the pinnacle of our public health science up until now. Now it seems more driven by political ideology than actual data and science, so it undermines the trust,” Huang said. “We’re all having to band together and provide that credible data- and science-driven messaging.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h000m3b6nognbjc47@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A recent &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/health/rfk-approval-cdc-trust-vaccines-kff"&gt;KFF poll&lt;/a&gt; found that public trust in the CDC is the lowest it’s been since the Covid-19 pandemic began. Only half of adults in the US say they trust the agency to provide reliable vaccine information, down from 57% in July and 63% in September 2024.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h000n3b6ntx0ezq96@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Despite all the chaos and mixed messages, we remain steadfast in our commitment to the health of our communities and making sure the message is clear on the importance of vaccination,” Huang said.

                Collagen is the most abundant protein in our bodies. It helps keep our skin firm and elastic. But as we age, the amount and quality of that collagen declines. And some people turn to supplements.

   &lt;p&gt;The explorer Ponce de Leon famously went to Florida in search of the fountain of youth. But if you listen to social media influencers, he should probably have headed to the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/04/nx-s1-5526053/are-creatine-supplements-all-that-theyre-pumped-up-to-be" target="_blank"&gt;supplement aisle &lt;/a&gt;to pick up some collagen.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm in my 40s and if I shave, I look like I'm in my mid-20s," a Tiktok creator who goes by Shop By Jake claims &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shopbyjake/video/7423801980809760043?q=collagen&amp;amp;t=1760564499655" target="_blank"&gt; in one paid promotion&lt;/a&gt;. "People ask me all the time, what do you do for your skin? I take collagen," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Claims about the health and beauty benefits of collagen supplements are commonplace these days, especially online. But does the evidence back the hype?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The claim&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Collagen supplements can promote healthier skin, hair and nails, and stronger joints.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The theory&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Collagen is the most &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/23089-collagen" target="_blank"&gt;abundant protein in the body&lt;/a&gt;. It's found in skin, hair, nails, tendons, ligaments, cartilage and bones. It helps maintain our skin's elasticity and volume. It's a structural protein, so it gives strength and integrity to our tissues and keeps joints strong, among other things. But starting in our 20s, the amount and quality of the collagen our bodies produce declines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Factors lik&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/06/17/nx-s1-5002030/sunscreen-tiktok-misinformation-melanoma" target="_blank"&gt;e UV radiation, &lt;/a&gt;smoking and exposure to&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/18/nx-s1-5436960/maha-rfk-toxic-chemicals-trump-hhs-epa" target="_blank"&gt; environmental pollutants &lt;/a&gt;can speed up that decline. But it's going to happen with age regardless, which is why lots of people turn to collagen supplements.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Collagen supplements generally come in two main forms.&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8944283/" target="_blank"&gt; Hydrolyzed collagen peptides&lt;/a&gt; are basically collagen that's been broken down into smaller chains of amino acids to make them easier to absorb. They're derived from animal sources, such as fish, cattle, pigs or chicken. That's typically what's used in supplements aimed at improving skin and hair, as well as joint health.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The theory is that if you ingest [a collagen supplement,] it goes through the GI tract and gets absorbed and then it theoretically goes to places to support or increase collagen production," says &lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/doctors/1720366636/lauren-taglia-md-phd" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Lauren Taglia&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified dermatologist with Northwestern Medicine in Naperville, Ill.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The second main form of supplement is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10058045/#:~:text=Native%20type%20II%20collagen%20has,tissues%20and%20exert%20chondroprotective%20effects." target="_blank"&gt;undenatured, or native, type II collagen&lt;/a&gt;, which hasn't been broken down. It's derived from chickens. Most of the collagen found in cartilage is type II. These kinds of supplements are thought to promote joint health by triggering the immune system to produce chemical messengers that tamp down inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So what does the research say?&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The evidence&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Let's start with skin.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When it comes to skin health, there are studies that suggest collagen supplements work.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There have been randomized controlled trials that have shown that after 8 to 12 weeks of collagen supplementation, things like depth of wrinkles, skin elasticity, dermal thickness seem to be improved," says&lt;a href="https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/10176" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Maryanne Makredes Senna&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of dermatology at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33742704/" target="_blank"&gt;meta-analysis of 19 studies published in 2021&lt;/a&gt; found that, compared with a placebo, people taking collagen supplements had better skin hydration, elasticity and improvements in wrinkles.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40324552/" target="_blank"&gt;second meta-analysis &lt;/a&gt;was published this year. It looked at 23 randomized controlled trials with more than 1,400 patients who took collagen supplements for skin issues, and it also found significant improvements in those same areas after 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Senna says those findings came with a big caveat: The studies that found the biggest improvements were lower-quality and were funded by the supplement industry, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"High-quality studies and studies not funded by industry did not show a significant association rate," Senna says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Given that, the state of the evidence when it comes to collagen supplements for skin is mixed at best, says dermatologist Lauren Taglia. "As physician-scientists, we would love to see studies done on a large scale and done independently," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;It's a similar story when it comes to collagen supplements for joint health. Studies have shown benefits — such as in &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/52/3/167" target="_blank"&gt;reducing pain from osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But again, much of the research is industry funded, so it can be hard to disentangle potential bias, says &lt;a href="https://www.bumc.bu.edu/camed/profile/david-felson/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. David Felson&lt;/a&gt;, an osteoarthritis researcher and professor at Boston University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1756-185X.14382" target="_blank"&gt;systematic review &lt;/a&gt;found that most of the studies of collagen supplements for rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis were too low quality to determine whether they really helped. Some studies included in that review reported adverse effects, such as an exacerbation of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"With respect to collagen, I don't know what the right answer is," Felson says. It could potentially help, but "there are no large scale studies here and there need to be," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If it's healthier skin you're after, collagen supplements "could be helpful, but there's not a ton of strong evidence to support them at this point," Taglia says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Your best bet is to focus on things that do have robust evidence behind them, says &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/maya-jonas-md-121877" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Maya Jonas&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of dermatology at the Ohio State University. That includes&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/06/04/1179542293/picking-the-right-sunscreen-isnt-as-important-as-avoiding-these-6-mistakes" target="_blank"&gt; wearing sunscreen and other sun protection&lt;/a&gt; and using &lt;a href="https://health.osu.edu/health/skin-and-body/what-retinoids-can-do-for-skin" target="_blank"&gt;vitamin A-based products like retinol&lt;/a&gt;, which have been clinically proven to stimulate collagen production. Keeping your skin moisturized is also important.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lifestyle factors matter too, Jonas says. She recommends a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, which provide antioxidants like vitamin C, and nuts and seeds, which are good sources of zinc and copper and help support collagen production.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We always talk about diet, making sure patients are eating a healthy Mediterranean diet that's well-balanced, avoiding alcohol, not smoking and avoiding secondhand smoke," Jonas says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10979338/" target="_blank"&gt;get plenty of sleep and exercise&lt;/a&gt;, adds Senna. Poor sleep and stress can &lt;a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jnsv/63/1/63_15/_article" target="_blank"&gt;take a toll on skin&lt;/a&gt;, while exercise can improve blood flow to the skin and may &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-37207-9" target="_blank"&gt;help counteract the loss of elasticity and dermal thickness&lt;/a&gt; that comes with aging.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's not just good for skin, but overall health, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A decade after a landmark study proved that feeding peanut products to young babies could prevent development of life-threatening allergies, new research finds the change has made a big difference in the real world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 60,000 children have avoided developing peanut allergies after guidance first issued in 2015 upended medical practice by recommending introducing the allergen to infants starting as early as 4 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's a remarkable thing, right?" said Dr. David Hill, an allergist and researcher at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and author of a study published Monday in the medical journal Pediatrics. Hill and colleagues analyzed electronic health records from dozens of pediatric practices to track diagnoses of food allergies in young children before, during and after the guidelines were issued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can actually come to you today and say there are less kids with food allergy today than there would have been if we hadn't implemented this public health effort," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings have relevance from those of us who treat patients to those caring for infants, and more awareness, education and advocacy could further increase the positive results we observed in this study," he continued. "Future studies could potentially explore specific feeding practices that help us better understand the timing, frequency and dose of foods that optimize protection against food allergies."&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that peanut allergies in children ages 0 to 3 declined by more than 27% after guidance for high-risk kids was first issued in 2015 and by more than 40% after the recommendations were expanded in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effort hasn't yet reduced an overall increase in food allergies in the U.S. in recent years. About 8% of children are affected, including more than 2% with a peanut allergy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peanut allergy is caused when the body's immune system mistakenly identifies proteins in peanuts as harmful and releases chemicals that trigger allergic symptoms, including hives, respiratory symptoms and, sometimes, life-threatening anaphylaxis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, doctors had recommended delaying feeding children peanuts and other foods likely to trigger allergies until age 3. But in 2015, Gideon Lack at King's College London published the groundbreaking Learning Early About Peanut Allergy, or LEAP, trial.  &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lack and colleagues showed that introducing peanut products in infancy reduced the future risk of developing food allergies by more than 80%. Later analysis showed that the protection persisted in about 70% of kids into adolescence.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study immediately sparked new guidelines urging early introduction of peanuts — but putting them into practice has been slow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only about 29% of pediatricians and 65% of allergists reported following the expanded guidance issued in 2017, surveys found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confusion and uncertainty about the best way to introduce peanuts early in life led to the lag, according to a commentary that accompanied the study. Early on, medical experts and parents alike questioned whether the practice could be adopted outside of tightly controlled clinical settings.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data for the analysis came from a subset of participating practice sites and may not represent the entire U.S. pediatric population, noted the commentary, led by Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a child allergy expert at Northwestern University.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the new research offers "promising evidence that early allergen introduction is not only being adopted but may be making a measurable impact," the authors concluded.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocates for the 33 million people in the U.S. with food allergies welcomed signs that early introduction of peanut products is catching on. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This research reinforces what we already know and underscores a meaningful opportunity to reduce the incidence and prevalence of peanut allergy nationwide," said Sung Poblete, chief executive of the nonprofit group Food Allergy Research &amp;amp; Education, or FARE.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study emphasizes the current guidance, updated in 2021, which calls for introducing peanuts and other major food allergens between four and six months, without prior screening or testing, Hill said. Parents should consult their pediatricians about any questions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It doesn't have to be a lot of the food, but little tastes of peanut butter, milk-based yogurt, soy-based yogurts and tree butters," he said. "These are really good ways to allow the immune system exposure to these allergenic foods in a safe way." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiffany Leon, 36, a Maryland registered dietician and director at FARE, introduced peanuts and other allergens early to her own sons, James, 4, and Cameron, 2. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, Leon's own mother was shocked at the advice to feed babies such foods before the age of 3, she said. But Leon explained how the science had changed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a dietician, I practice evidence-based recommendations," she said. "So when someone told me, 'This is how it's done now, these are the new guidelines,' I just thought, 'OK, well, this is what we're going to do.'"&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;

Researchers found that these forms of exercise were the most effective for easing pain, improving movement, and enhancing overall quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although other exercise types can provide added benefits, the researchers emphasized that aerobic activity should remain the foundation of treatment. Osteoarthritis develops when the cartilage cushioning the ends of bones wears down, leading to swelling, stiffness, and discomfort. It can affect any joint, but the knees are most commonly impacted. About 30% of adults over age 45 show signs of knee osteoarthritis on x-rays, and roughly half of them experience significant pain and mobility problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filling the Evidence Gap in Exercise Guidance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise is a cornerstone of osteoarthritis care, yet many medical guidelines lack clear direction on which kinds are most beneficial for knee osteoarthritis specifically. To clarify this, researchers analyzed the effectiveness and safety of several exercise approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their comprehensive analysis drew on 217 randomized clinical trials conducted between 1990 and 2024. In total, the research included 15,684 participants and compared multiple exercise categories -- including aerobic, flexibility, strengthening, mind-body, neuromotor, and mixed programs -- against control groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluating Pain Relief, Function, and Mobility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trials varied in quality, but the team assessed the strength of the evidence using the internationally recognized GRADE system. They examined several key outcomes: pain reduction, physical function, gait performance, and quality of life. Each was measured at short term (four weeks), mid-term (12 weeks), and long term (24 weeks) follow-ups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across these studies, aerobic exercise consistently ranked highest in improving outcomes among all exercise types tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aerobic Activity Delivers the Broadest Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moderate-certainty evidence showed that, compared with control groups, aerobic exercise effectively reduced short- and mid-term pain and improved function in both the short and long term. It also enhanced gait performance and quality of life over short and mid-term periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other exercise forms showed value too. Mind-body workouts likely provided a notable improvement in short-term function, neuromotor exercises likely boosted short-term gait performance, and strengthening or mixed routines improved function in the mid-term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safe and Effective for Long-Term Use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, none of the exercise types resulted in more adverse events than the control groups, indicating that these therapies are generally safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors did acknowledge some study limitations. Many results came from indirect comparisons, certain outcomes lacked long-term data, and smaller studies may have influenced some early findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clear Takeaway for Patients and Clinicians&lt;/strong&gt;Despite these limitations, the researchers describe their work as one of the most complete and current evaluations of exercise for managing knee osteoarthritis. They believe the findings will help clinicians make more targeted recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the evidence, the team advises aerobic exercise "as a first line intervention for knee osteoarthritis management, particularly when the aim is to improve functional capacity and reduce pain" and say if aerobic exercise is not possible owing to individual limitations, "alternative forms of structured physical activity may still be beneficial."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;A decade after a landmark study proved that feeding peanut products to young babies could &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLhHL8pjYRc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;prevent development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of life-threatening allergies, new research finds the change has made a big difference in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 60,000 children have avoided developing peanut allergies after guidance first issued in 2015 upended medical practice by recommending introducing the allergen to infants starting as early as 4 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s a remarkable thing, right?” said Dr. David Hill, an allergist and researcher at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and author of a study &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/online-first?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published Monday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the medical journal Pediatrics. Hill and colleagues analyzed electronic health records from dozens of pediatric practices to track diagnoses of food allergies in young children before, during and after the guidelines were issued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can actually come to you today and say there are less kids with food allergy today than there would have been if we hadn’t implemented this public health effort,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that peanut allergies in children ages 0 to 3 declined by more than 27% after guidance for high-risk kids was first issued in 2015 and by more than 40% after the recommendations were expanded in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The effort hasn’t yet reduced an overall increase in food allergies in the U.S. in recent years. About 8% of children are affected, including more than 2% with a peanut allergy.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Peanut allergy is caused when the body’s immune system mistakenly identifies proteins in peanuts as harmful and releases chemicals that trigger allergic symptoms, including hives, respiratory symptoms and, sometimes, life-threatening anaphylaxis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, doctors had recommended delaying feeding children peanuts and other foods likely to trigger allergies until age 3. But in 2015, Gideon Lack at King’s College London, published the groundbreaking &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1414850" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Learning Early About Peanut Allergy,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or LEAP, trial. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Lack and colleagues showed that introducing peanut products in infancy reduced the future risk of developing food allergies by more than 80%. Later analysis showed that the protection persisted in about 70% of kids into adolescence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study immediately sparked new guidelines urging early introduction of peanuts — but putting them into practice has been slow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only about 29% of pediatricians and 65% of allergists reported following the expanded guidance issued in 2017, surveys found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confusion and uncertainty about the best way to introduce peanuts early in life led to the lag, according to a commentary that accompanied the study. Early on, medical experts and parents alike questioned whether the practice could be adopted outside of tightly controlled clinical settings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data for the analysis came from a subset of participating practice sites and may not represent the entire U.S. pediatric population, noted the commentary, led by Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a child allergy expert at Northwestern University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the new research offers “promising evidence that early allergen introduction is not only being adopted but may be making a measurable impact,” the authors concluded. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Advocates for the 33 million people in the U.S. with food allergies welcomed signs that early introduction of peanut products is catching on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research reinforces what we already know and underscores a meaningful opportunity to reduce the incidence and prevalence of peanut allergy nationwide,” said Sung Poblete, chief executive of the nonprofit group Food Allergy Research &amp;amp; Education, or FARE. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study emphasizes the current guidance, updated in 2021, which calls for introducing peanuts and other major food allergens between four and six months, without prior screening or testing, Hill said. Parents should consult their pediatricians about any questions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t have to be a lot of the food, but little tastes of peanut butter, milk-based yogurt, soy-based yogurts and tree butters,” he said. “These are really good ways to allow the immune system exposure to these allergenic foods in a safe way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiffany Leon, 36, a Maryland registered dietician and director at FARE, introduced peanuts and other allergens early to her own sons, James, 4, and Cameron, 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;At first, Leon’s own mother was shocked at the advice to feed babies such foods before the age of 3, she said. But Leon explained how the science had changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a dietician, I practice evidence-based recommendations,” she said. “So when someone told me, ‘This is how it’s done now, these are the new guidelines,’ I just though, OK, well, this is what we’re going to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;——-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

It’s a Thursday morning, not even 24 hours since my C-section. I’m watching my newborn son nap in his bassinet and trying to enjoy my first meal since surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The caller ID says CHKD Children’s Hospital, so I answer. My 16-month-old daughter was just released from that hospital earlier in the week following a severe bacterial infection that caused her lymph nodes to swell an extraordinary amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Hello?” I say, worried that they uncovered something concerning in her bloodwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Hello, I’m a pediatrician at Norfolk Children’s Hospital. I’m calling to check on Camille, and to let you know that she may have been exposed to the measles during her stay with us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;My heart dropped, and the post-surgery nausea that had nearly subsided suddenly returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The doctor proceeded to tell me that she was reading from a script, and that they (under the advisement of the &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/2025-news-releases/virginia-health-officials-confirm-measles-case-in-eastern-region/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Virginia Department of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Virginia Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;) were recommending that all young children exposed receive their second measles vaccine as soon as possible. She then asked me about the vaccination status of everyone else who visited my daughter at the hospital, including myself, my parents, my husband and my almost-3-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Thankfully, both of my daughters had their first measles shot, which grants immunity in &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/insights/2025/05/measles-risk-vaccination-young-old.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:up to 95% of individuals;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;up to 95% of individuals&lt;/a&gt;. However, I now have a vulnerable infant to consider, and even a small chance of exposing him to this virus with no protection is too big of a risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So, under the advice of our pediatrician, I decided to give both of my daughters their second measles-mumps-rubella vaccine early. I didn’t feel entirely comfortable with this decision — especially with my 16-month-old just recovering from an infection and borderline immunocompromised. But it was the best decision available to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And because of parents who opt out of vaccinating their kids, I was put in the position to make it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The recent measles scare in Virginia came from a student at a local elementary school. Though the individual’s vaccination status was not directly stated in a &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tKGC4YZAa4g6Vsua0qVEmN-zgZ3AxuJ6/view" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:letter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; from the Virginia Beach Department of Health or in an &lt;a href="https://www.wtkr.com/news/virginia-department-of-health-reports-measles-case-in-hampton-roads" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:interview;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with officials, several local outlets have taken this opportunity to advocate for the safety and continued necessity of childhood vaccinations. Of the 1,491 confirmed cases of measles in the U.S. this year, &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/infectious-disease/measles/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:92% occurred in individuals;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;92% occurred in individuals&lt;/a&gt; who were unvaccinated (or who had an unknown vaccination status).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In fact, &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/2025/us-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2025;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;2025&lt;/a&gt; boasts more measles cases since the disease was considered eliminated in 2000 — and more than any other year in the past three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/big-brains-podcast-why-measles-resurging-and-rise-vaccine-hesitancy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Low vaccination rates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Low vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; caused by vaccine hesitancy and anti-vaccine movements are largely to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In other words, parents who choose not to vaccinate their children play a major role in these outbreaks ― which will continue to rise if nothing changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Photo Courtesy Of Lauren Gumpert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The author's two daughters visiting their newest sibling at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As parents, we make hundreds of decisions on a daily basis — some inconsequential, others less so. We’re constantly weighing pros and cons, risks and benefits. In a world that feels more disconnected than ever — when we can bury our heads into our phones and surround ourselves with an echo chamber of conspiratorial ideas — it’s easy to lose sight of the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So let’s zoom out for a minute. In 1900, infectious diseases (such as pneumonia, influenza and measles) &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/health/402687/measles-outbreak-vaccine-kids-children-history" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:killed about 18% of children;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;killed about 18% of children&lt;/a&gt;. Before vaccines and other public health measures, 1 in 5 children did not live to see their first birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Compare that reality to today, when &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/health/402687/measles-outbreak-vaccine-kids-children-history" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:less than 1%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;less than 1%&lt;/a&gt; of children die before their fifth birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Back then, childhood was inherently dangerous. Even if they lived, those who became infected with a virus such as measles often suffered &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/measles-increases-disease-risk" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:long-term side effects;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;long-term side effects&lt;/a&gt; such as brain damage and a permanently weakened immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The success of public health measures such as vaccines has given people a &lt;a href="https://www.vaccinestoday.eu/stories/the-public-health-paradox-vaccines-are-a-victim-of-their-own-success/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:false sense of security;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;false sense of security&lt;/a&gt;, leading many to conclude that once-tragic diseases are no longer a threat. But it’s only thanks to science that illness and death among children is no longer commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nowadays, it’s easy to take our health for granted — especially with &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/18/rfk-jr-anti-vaxxer-vaccine-skeptic/#:~:text=Kennedy%20likes%20to%20say%20that,of%20how%20they%20describe%20themselves." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; steering the narrative at the helm of the Department of Health and Human Services. We have the luxury of arguing over genetically modified organisms and artificial food colors and doubting the effectiveness of the very things that have kept us safe for the past half-century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I won’t pretend to understand the various circumstances that might lead a parent not to vaccinate their child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But I do know that as parents (and human beings), we have a responsibility to protect all children. I’m reminded of a quote by author and activist &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10931895-there-s-no-such-thing-as-other-people-s-children" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Glennon Doyle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Glennon Doyle&lt;/a&gt; who said, “There’s no such thing as other people’s children.” We have an obligation to protect those who cannot opt to protect themselves. This is why I keep my kids home when they’re sick, why I advocate for stricter gun laws and — yes — why I vaccinate my kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Because measles is an airborne disease, one infected person can easily pass it on to &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/story-measles-five-charts" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:18 other people;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;18 other people&lt;/a&gt;. To achieve herd immunity, 95% of the population must be fully vaccinated. Unfortunately, vaccination rates among children have continued to decline since the COVID-19 pandemic, with &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/2025/across-the-us-childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline#:~:text=During%20the%202024%2D25%20school,prevent%20transmission%20of%20measles%20virus." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:only 92.5% of kindergartners;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;only 92.5% of kindergartners&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. reportedly vaccinated against measles last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Just this week, &lt;a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=5135#:~:text=Public%20Health%20Reminds%20Residents%20About,years%20after%20the%20initial%20diagnosis." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a school-aged child in California died;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a school-aged child in California died&lt;/a&gt; due to a delayed measles-related complication known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). The child contracted the disease in infancy before they were eligible for vaccination. If infected, my newborn son could suffer the same fate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I don’t want my kids — or anyone else’s — to become another preventable casualty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So, both of my daughters received their second MMR vaccine ahead of schedule. However, we still aren’t out of the woods, because measles &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/measles/#:~:text=If%20you%20think%20you%20might,discuss%20post%2Dexposure%20treatment%20options." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:symptoms can appear as late as 21 days after exposure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;symptoms can appear as late as 21 days after exposure&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.babycenter.com/health/doctor-visits-and-vaccines/my-child-developed-a-rash-about-a-week-after-receiving-the-m_1471851" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:about 5% of children;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;about 5% of children&lt;/a&gt; who receive their second vaccine develop a measles-like rash and fever, so it can be difficult to determine whether they have the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now I’m left to wonder and stress about every little bump that surfaces on my daughters’ skin. And if one of them does develop symptoms, I’ll have to contact the &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/2025-news-releases/virginia-health-officials-confirm-measles-case-in-eastern-region/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Virginia Department of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Virginia Department of Health&lt;/a&gt; to get them tested, because I can’t bring them to the pediatrician and risk exposing other vulnerable children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I understand why many parents have grown to distrust medical institutions. I’ve also had my fair share of negative experiences that sometimes make me doubt doctors’ recommendations and interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But overall, I believe that people in helping professions (like medicine) have good intentions. The millions of doctors and organizations supporting and promoting vaccine use would not intentionally harm children. RFK, on the other hand, seems to change his opinion often &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/12/politics/rfk-jrs-long-complicated-history-with-the-measles-vaccines" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:to suit his political agenda;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;to suit his political agenda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Despite the fact that a link between vaccines and autism has been disproven &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-vaccines-safe-and-effect-no-link-to-autism/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMultiple%20studies%20from%20around%20the,living%20rich%2C%20fulfilling%20lives.%E2%80%9D" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:over and over;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;over and over&lt;/a&gt;, RFK Jr. continues to spread lies and misinformation. He promised Americans that he would find a cause for the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/10/health/kennedy-autism-causes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:“autism epidemic”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;“autism epidemic”&lt;/a&gt; — a pursuit that won him support among many parents. However, with no formal medical or public health training, the secretary of health continues to undermine the scientific process by hiring incompetent individuals and misappropriating resources to maintain his base of support. For example, he recently employed a known &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/health/rfk-jr-autism-vaccines.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pseudoscientist;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;pseudoscientist&lt;/a&gt; to uncover a link between vaccines and autism (which, as previously stated, studies have found &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M18-2101?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:does not exist;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;does not exist&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In light of &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/18/nx-s1-5542082/cdc-acip-vaccine-hepatitis-b-mmrv" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recent threats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;recent threats&lt;/a&gt; to vaccine access, 34 scientific and medical organizations including the American Association of Immunologists and the American College of Physicians have come together to produce a &lt;a href="https://www.acponline.org/acp-newsroom/leading-organizations-unite-to-affirm-vaccine-safety-amid-rising-misinformation-and-declining-trust" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:statement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; reaffirming the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With so many conspiracy theories circulating on the internet, it can be difficult to know who to trust. As a result, many parents fail to recognize the far-reaching implications of their choices. A once-standard public health measure has become politicized and exploited — and our children will suffer because of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Mother Teresa said: “If we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The consequences of a decision like not vaccinating your child are not hypothetical. By now, hundreds of families in Virginia Beach like mine have been affected by one family’s choices. None of us live on an island, and our actions continue to ripple outward and affect others in unexpected ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In this life, we have no choice but to rely on each other. As parents, we have the power to end preventable deaths by vaccinating our children. I hope the vaccine skeptics among us will find the strength to do what’s necessary to keep all of our children safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/measles-exposure-anti-vaccine-movement_n_68d1bba8e4b03c190c21c872" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HuffPost;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;HuffPost&lt;/a&gt; in September 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News UK</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 02:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE9sNjdMVzRXbFZCRlpxNGhRdU51ZDVmbnFNZ3BheXJFOW8yVFY0YzFRbFRfdTRKLTNWVEZCMkVCWWU3eDdiS1c4Tl9nQmJVY2hQSHc2SUNERVpyczB4WHVSLWxZRFJxUllkY18wdG1SUQ</guid></item><item><title>一种甜美的水果，还可以控制血糖水平。研究声称它降低了糖尿病患者的风险-《经济时报》</title><link>https://m.economictimes.com/magazines/panache/a-fruit-that-is-sweet-and-can-also-control-blood-sugar-levels-study-claims-it-lowers-diabetics-risk/articleshow/124570023.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-brcount="28" class="artText"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may sound surprising, but research suggests that eating mangoes—a fruit known for its natural sweetness—can actually help manage &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a ref="dofollow" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" href="/topic/blood-sugar-levels" target="_blank"&gt;blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. A study conducted by researchers at &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a ref="dofollow" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" href="/topic/george-mason-university" target="_blank"&gt;George Mason University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; revealed that individuals who consumed mango daily had better blood sugar control and reduced body fat compared to those who opted for low-sugar snacks. The study’s findings, published in Foods in August 2025 under the title “Daily Mango Intake Improves Glycemic and Body Composition Outcomes in Adults with Prediabetes: A Randomized Controlled Study,” emphasize that the nutritional context of sugar within whole foods plays a more crucial role than the sugar content alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Science Behind Mango’s Benefits&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with&lt;/p&gt;&lt;em&gt; Science Daily&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Raedeh Basiri, Assistant Professor in George Mason’s Department of Nutrition and Food Studies, explained that it’s not simply about how much sugar food contains, but about the overall nutritional makeup. Mangoes, for instance, offer a unique balance—while they contain natural sugars, these are accompanied by fiber, antioxidants, and essential vitamins. This combination helps slow sugar absorption, keeping blood glucose levels stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-newpos-mgid="mgid_124570023" id="div-mgid-mid-newpos-124570023"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="E_3" class="etoro"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, foods that contain added sugars—such as processed cereals or packaged low-sugar snacks—lack this natural balance and can actually heighten the risk of developing diabetes. The fiber in mangoes supports digestion and promotes satiety, helping control appetite and preventing overeating, which further aids weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Glycemic Index and Safe Consumption Tips&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mangoes fall within a moderate range on the glycemic index (GI), scoring between 51 and 56, a range comparable to orange juice. According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a ref="dofollow" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" href="/topic/american-diabetes-association" target="_blank"&gt;American Diabetes Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; (ADA), this places mangoes in the low-to-medium GI category, making them suitable for moderate consumption. The ADA recommends choosing fruits that are fresh, frozen, or canned without added sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-vdoai="vdoai_124570023" id="div-vdoai-mid-124570023"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typical serving of fruit should provide around 15 grams of carbohydrates, which roughly equals two-thirds of a cup of mango. The ADA also notes that fresh fruit tends to be more satisfying than dried varieties, as the portion size of dried fruit is smaller and can lead to excessive intake of sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID_INTL_300" data-loc="100" id="div-gpt-ad-858478126-1-124570023" class="country_specAD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="2" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-124570023" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="5" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-124570023" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="3" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-124570023" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Additional Health Perks&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond controlling blood sugar, mangoes may also improve cholesterol levels. A study published in the British Journal of Nutrition in 2011 observed that mice fed a high-fat diet supplemented with freeze-dried mango exhibited lower body fat, reduced cholesterol, and improved glucose levels compared to those treated with lipid- or sugar-lowering drugs like fenofibrate and rosiglitazone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research underscores that incorporating whole fruits like mangoes into one’s diet not only satisfies sweet cravings naturally but also supports metabolic health, making this tropical fruit a surprisingly smart choice for balanced living.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Signs Of High Blood Sugar&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per a Cleveland Clinic report, early signs of high blood sugar, also known as hyperglycemia, often appear gradually and may include excessive thirst or hunger, frequent urination, headaches, and blurred vision. These symptoms occur as the body struggles to manage rising glucose levels. If left unchecked for a longer period, chronic hyperglycemia can lead to more serious issues such as persistent fatigue, unexplained weight loss, recurring vaginal yeast or skin infections, and slow-healing cuts or sores. Recognizing these warning signals early is crucial, as timely lifestyle changes and medical intervention can help prevent severe complications like nerve damage or diabetes-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How To Keep Blood Sugar In Check?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To maintain healthy blood sugar levels, focus on a balanced diet rich in fiber, whole grains, lean proteins, and non-starchy vegetables. Limit refined sugars, processed foods, and sweetened beverages. Eat smaller, regular meals to prevent spikes and dips in glucose. Stay active with at least 30 minutes of daily exercise, such as brisk walking or yoga. Manage stress through meditation or deep breathing, as stress hormones can raise blood sugar. Get enough sleep and stay hydrated. Regularly monitor blood glucose levels, and follow your doctor’s advice to keep your sugar within a healthy range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;meta content="cms.article3" name="cmsei-article3"&gt;&lt;div class="inSideInd"&gt;&lt;div data-ga-action="Preference Banner InArticle Widget" data-ga-impression="Preference Banner InArticle Widget#Impressions | Preference Banner | Articleshow#url" class="Pbanner"&gt;&lt;div class="Pbannertext"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="ET Logo" src="https://img.etimg.com/photo/123467569.cms"&gt;&lt;p&gt; as a Reliable and Trusted News Source&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Economic Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 01:26:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAJBVV95cUxQNkQzYUE3YktFWHNVSHpSYzZrVWtrY083WWthSEhacWprS20wR01OUjc2ZlpVSFRnWUdVbVRhZEpPNER1LWFlWEtRNFVZU3RPR2g2dkJWRi1QNlNDNHpTY3o0MGItYTF6N2pZOEl6UWlDMV8tOWNTaHdjSS1qTF9ZX2cwUXhoaklrQ1NlSkZzQkpwSWVVT1lLNS1adjlrUnpGSTZndzNoM1RqOEdmUndQSU84VkJKQ0JYaTlZVkhpT3dVdnBVd2NUYkwtZmJNbGJFU2F2V1VCdmw5TGxaTHlvNVA3TU01NERjdGpzbm50eVB3VEREM1pnN3pTc2xDMkVm</guid></item><item><title>最后一名埃博拉患者在刚果民主共和国出院，世卫组织表示-半岛电视台</title><link>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/last-ebola-patient-discharged-from-dr-congo-who</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;header class="article-header"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Last Ebola patient discharged in DR Congo, WHO says&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="article__subhead"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barring new cases, the patient’s recovery kicks off a 42-day countdown to declaring the country’s 16th outbreak over.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/header&gt;&lt;div class="article-info m--t-20 m--desktop-b-30 m--b-mobile-20"&gt;&lt;div class="article-dates"&gt;&lt;p class="date-simple"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;Published On 19 Oct 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;19 Oct 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="rich-share" data-testid="rich-share"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-share__wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-share__button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;button class="rich-share__button row" aria-expanded="false"&gt;&lt;p class="screen-reader-text"&gt;Click here to share on social media&lt;/p&gt;&lt;svg class="icon icon--share2 icon--primary icon--16 " viewbox="0 0 20 16" version="1.1" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;title&gt;share2&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path fill="#000" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M11.688 9.048c-.659 0-1.252.282-1.673.733l-4.92-2.45c.016-.115.028-.232.028-.352 0-.117-.011-.23-.027-.343l4.913-2.423a2.285 2.285 0 0 0 1.68.739C12.964 4.952 14 3.899 14 2.6 14 1.302 12.965.25 11.688.25S9.377 1.302 9.377 2.601c0 .117.01.23.027.343L4.49 5.367a2.285 2.285 0 0 0-1.68-.739C1.536 4.628.5 5.681.5 6.979c0 1.299 1.035 2.35 2.312 2.35.659 0 1.252-.281 1.673-.731l4.92 2.45a2.357 2.357 0 0 0-.029.351c0 1.299 1.035 2.351 2.312 2.351S14 12.698 14 11.399s-1.035-2.35-2.312-2.35Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;p class="rich-share__social-text"&gt;Share&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last Ebola patient in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has been released from a treatment centre in Kasai province, according to the United Nations health agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient is the 19th to recover out of 64 total cases recorded since the &lt;a href="/news/2025/9/4/dr-congo-announces-new-ebola-outbreak"&gt;outbreak was declared&lt;/a&gt; in September, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section class="more-on"&gt;&lt;h2 class="more-on__heading"&gt;Recommended Stories &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list of 3 items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;end of list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;If no new cases are discovered in the next 42 days, the outbreak will be declared over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mohamed Janabi, the WHO’s director for Africa, said the recovery was a “remarkable achievement”, given the outbreak began just six weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The country’s robust response, with support from WHO and partners, was pivotal to this achievement,” he added in a social media post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;In a video alongside the post on X, health workers were seen celebrating as the final patient exited the treatment centre in Bulape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreak, which is the DRC’s 16th to date, was declared on September 4 as Ebola cases appeared in the Bulape and Mweka areas of the Kasai province in the country’s southwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, the WHO has tallied 53 confirmed and 11 probable cases, with patients showing typical Ebola symptoms such as fever, vomiting, diarrhoea and haemorrhaging. Forty-five people have died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remote Kasai province has proven challenging to reach, even as it may have helped to prevent the spread of the virus, health officials have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-newsletter-slot" data-testid="article-newsletter-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the WHO deployed response teams and set up a 32-bed treatment centre for the first time “outside a simulation exercise” in the region, the organisation said. More than 35,000 people have received vaccinations in the Bulape area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No new cases have been identified since September 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ebola was first identified in 1976 after an outbreak in what is now the DRC. Without treatment, up to 90 percent of cases are fatal, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest outbreak occurred from 2014 to 2016 in West Africa, ultimately infecting 28,600 and killing 11,325 people, with the disease also spreading to Europe and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DRC’s most recent outbreak occurred in 2022 and involved just one &lt;a href="/news/2022/9/27/dr-congo-declares-end-latest-ebola-virus-outbreak"&gt;recorded case&lt;/a&gt; of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2025 21:43:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxORGtKRkZXYlJ3ckRtWW1fS2oxQ1ZIbU16V00zeXNZeHFhVGkxdWdMazBzT1RYWGEybU5wRXE0NTZmZFJHUldqYkJhWExjbXI0SDBYcGRZcDdQU3lqQlBLbVlvM21UMHRQUDNmY2lRWmZLUTVlbTFnVDNRZ3g5M0FiM3pQQU1Kd0lNdmNCWnliU3hrNmvSAZgBQVVfeXFMT0RrNmh4X0pYZlY5bGJkWnhwd3hhaFV0aEdXQXg1bUZGTHdiTUhIQlhTc3VLQ2xnaHJEd1VKaWdaMnNBRVMyTmVoS2FiRGZsMmJYeEFuUUhfZkNYcmxhSkdiSHNOUDNiN3BIbHNqdkVGTkpYbmFBSTI5NmdyMlZZTi1iNldVMW5tb2R6bmhqQjEtQUx1TjlTQW8</guid></item><item><title>根据传染病医生的说法，如果您生病了，要避免的“健康”活动- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/healthy-activity-avoid-sick-according-182500780.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one wants to get sick. As a kid, at least coming down with a virus meant spending a day on the couch watching TV instead of going to school. But as an adult, life’s demands don’t just stop when you’re not feeling well. There are still deadlines to meet and kids’ lunches to pack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so much going on (why is it that there’s never a good time to get sick?), it’s tempting to push through an illness instead of rest, trying to keep with your normal routine as much as possible. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2947637/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:According to one scientific study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;According to one scientific study&lt;/a&gt;, 94% of surveyed ill employees went to work while sick and 8% vomited while at work. (As if you needed another reminder to &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/flumist-at-home-review" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:get your flu shot;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;get your flu shot&lt;/a&gt;, right?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s worth emphasizing that if you’re feeling sick, &lt;a href="https://parade.com/living/phrases-to-use-for-sick-day-email-according-to-hr-expert" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:you should rest at home;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;you should rest at home&lt;/a&gt; instead of going to work. This will prevent others from getting sick and help you heal faster.

On the other hand, you probably feel more fatigued and weak than you normally do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.unlv.edu/people/brian-labus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Brian Labus, PhD, MPH, REHS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Brian Labus, PhD, MPH, REHS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; an infectious disease epidemiologist and professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, whether or not you should work out when you’re sick depends on the type of illness you have. If it’s just a slight head cold, he says that working out probably won’t do much harm. But if it’s a stomach virus or upper respiratory infection, he warns against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/habit-to-break-to-avoid-getting-sick-according-to-doctors" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The One Habit Doctors Are Begging You To Break ASAP if You Don't Want To Get Sick This Fall;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The One Habit Doctors Are Begging You To Break ASAP if You Don't Want To Get Sick This Fall &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you have a serious respiratory illness, you’re going to have trouble breathing to begin with. Even if it’s just a cough, something is happening that’s hurting your lungs. Working out on top of that can be very taxing on the body and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11282332/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:make it harder to recover from the illness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;make it harder to recover from the illness&lt;/a&gt;,” Dr. Labus says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to taxing the body, he explains that working out leads to losing fluid through sweat, which is the opposite of what the body needs when you’re sick. This is another reason it can take longer to bounce back if you push through a hard workout when you’re feeling under the weather. He emphasizes that it’s an absolute myth that you can “sweat out an illness.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The virus or bacteria that’s making you sick doesn’t care about sweating,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/one-food-to-shorten-a-cold-according-to-registered-dietitians" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The One Food Nutritionists Say Can Help Shorten a Cold;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The One Food Nutritionists Say Can Help Shorten a Cold&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only does working out when you have an upper respiratory infection (such as COVID, the flu, RSV, strep throat or the common cold), mean it will likely take you longer to recover, it also puts others around you at risk. “When you’re working out, you’re breathing heavily. Breathing heavily puts a lot more of the virus into the air, which puts others at risk,” Dr. Labus says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you absolutely must work out even though you’re sick, he recommends exerting yourself less than you normally do and to work out outside, away from other people. This can look like going for a walk around the block or moving through a gentle yoga flow in your yard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/gym-habits-that-can-make-you-sick-according-to-doctors" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Headed Back to the Gym?

Doctors Are Urging You To Avoid These Gross Habits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How To Know When You Can Start Working Out Again&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to work or work out when you’re sick, Dr. Labus recommends focusing on resting and hydrating. This, he says, is the best way to take care of your immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of how to know when you’ve recovered from your illness enough that you can start working out again, Dr. Labus stresses that it depends on the type of illness you have and how severe your symptoms are. “A head cold typically lasts a couple of days, but the flu can last up to a week,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds that there isn’t one hard and fast rule about when to start working out again after being sick. “Every person is unique and every [illness] is unique,” he tells &lt;em&gt;Parade&lt;/em&gt;. For example, an adult who is young or middle-aged and in good health may recover faster than an elderly adult or someone with an underlying illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since everyone is different, Dr. Labus recommends listening to your body and acting accordingly. When you do feel ready to work out again, he recommends easing into it instead of doing an intense workout on your first day back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working out regularly is a great habit to have and benefits the body in a myriad of ways, but that doesn’t mean you should push through when you’re sick. Taking a few days off will help you recover faster and is the best way to care for your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/how-to-keep-this-bathroom-staple-bacteria-free" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: This Bathroom Staple Could Be Making You Sick—Here’s How To Keep It Bacteria-Free;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Related: This Bathroom Staple Could Be Making You Sick—Here’s How To Keep It Bacteria-Free&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sources:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally reported by &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-to-avoid-when-you-start-feeling-sick" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt; on Oct 19, 2025, where it first appeared in the &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Health &amp;amp; Wellness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Health &amp;amp; Wellness&lt;/a&gt; section.
