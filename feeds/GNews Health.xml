                                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                    &lt;div class="hsa-paywall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawaii Department of Health said a travel-related Zika virus case has been confirmed on Oahu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is Hawaii’s first confirmed Zika case this year. Another travel-related Zika case was &lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/05/28/breaking-news/doh-travel-related-zika-virus-case-confirmed-on-oahu/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in Hawaii, also on Oahu, in May of last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH said travel-associated cases were more frequently reported in Hawaii between 2015 to 2019, when Zika was circulating globally, and peaked at 25 cases in 2017. To date, no locally acquired cases have been documented in Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/disease_listing/zika-virus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; Zika &lt;/a&gt;virus – like dengue — spreads primarily through the bite of an infected mosquito. While Hawaii has the mosquito species capable of transmitting Zika, the virus is not established in Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also be spread through sex, or to a fetus during pregnancy, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – and infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects and is linked to complications, including miscarriage, stillbirth and preterm birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common symptoms of Zika include fever, rash, headache, red eyes and joint and muscle pain. Many people infected with Zika, however, will have no symptoms or only have mild symptoms, CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, DOH also confirmed another travel-related case of dengue on Oahu, which will be counted as the 15th case of dengue in Hawaii in 2025 based on when the symptoms began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of dengue include fever, rash, nausea, vomiting and aches and pains, including eye pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are not related to one another, according to DOH, and affected individuals were exposed while traveling in regions where the viruses are known to circulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”DOH teams have been deployed to conduct outreach, inspections and implement mosquito control measures in the affected areas,” the department said. “Because both Zika and dengue are transmitted by mosquitoes that exist locally, controlling mosquito populations in the affected areas is critical to preventing spread.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH said it would continue to monitor mosquito numbers in the affected areas, but did not disclose what parts of Oahu were impacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC advises travelers to check Zika and dengue risk information before departure. Anyone experiencing symptoms within two weeks after visiting an area with risk of Zika or dengue should consult their doctors and inform them of possible exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health care providers and anyone who suspect Zika or dengue infection should also call the Disease Reporting Line at 808-586-4586.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;A measles outbreak in South Carolina that began in October is now wildly accelerating, doubling in just the past week to a total of &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/measles-rubeola/2025-measles-outbreak"&gt;434 cases&lt;/a&gt;, with 409 people currently in quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid the outbreak, South Carolina health officials have been providing updates on cases every Tuesday and Friday. On Tuesday, state health officials reported &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/tuesday-measles-update-dph-reports-124-new-measles-cases-upstate-new-public-exposures-and"&gt;124 more cases&lt;/a&gt; since last Friday, which had &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/measles-continues-raging-in-south-carolina-99-new-cases-since-tuesday/"&gt;99 new cases&lt;/a&gt; since the previous Tuesday. On that day, January 6, officials noted a more modest increase of 26 cases, bringing the outbreak total at that point to &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/tuesday-measles-update-dph-reports-26-new-measles-cases-upstate-bringing-outbreak-total-211"&gt;211 cases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the 3-month-old outbreak now doubled in just a week, health officials are renewing calls for people to get vaccinated against the highly infectious virus—an effort that has met with little success since October. Still, the health department is activating its mobile health unit to offer free measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccinations, as well as flu vaccinations at two locations today and Thursday in the Spartanburg area, the epicenter of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials are also warning that they’re losing the ability to trace cases, and exposures are continuing. Last Friday, someone contagious with measles was in the South Carolina State Museum in Columbia between 1 pm and 5 pm ET. Anyone in the museum during that time and unvaccinated is at risk of contracting the infection. The virus spreads through the air and can linger in a room’s airspace for up to two hours after an infected person has left. Measles is so contagious that up to 90 percent of unvaccinated people exposed will fall ill.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Stiff knees, aching hips, and the slow grind of chronic joint pain are often accepted as an unavoidable part of getting older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while osteoarthritis is the world's most common joint disease, experts say the way we treat and prevent it is badly out of step with the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best medicine isn't found in a pill bottle or an operating theatre – it's movement. Yet across countries and health systems, too few patients are being guided toward the one therapy proven to protect their joints and ease their pain: &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/exercise-670"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-breakthrough-to-restore-aging-joints-could-help-treat-osteoarthritis"&gt;New Breakthrough to Restore Aging Joints Could Help Treat Osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is one of the most effective treatments for chronic, disabling joint conditions &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-are-the-key-risk-factors-for-developing-knee-osteoarthritis-we-reviewed-the-evidence-253722"&gt;such as osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt;. Yet very few patients actually receive it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research across health systems in &lt;a href="http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11227783/"&gt;Ireland, the UK, Norway&lt;/a&gt;, and the United States shows the same pattern: fewer than half of people with osteoarthritis are referred to exercise or physiotherapy by their primary care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 60 percent are given treatments that guidelines do not recommend, and around 40 percent are sent to a surgeon before &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/do-you-have-knee-pain-from-osteoarthritis-you-might-not-need-surgery-heres-what-to-try-instead-236779"&gt;non-surgical options&lt;/a&gt; have even been tried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why those figures are so troubling, it helps to understand what exercise does for joints. Osteoarthritis is by far the most common form of arthritis, already affecting more than 595 million people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanrhe/article/PIIS2665-9913(23)00163-7/fulltext"&gt;global study in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that number could approach one billion by 2050. Longer life expectancy, increasingly sedentary lifestyles, and rising numbers of overweight or obese people are driving the trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet people who exercise regularly are physically and biologically protecting themselves from developing the disease and from suffering its worst effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cartilage that covers the ends of our bones is a tough, protective layer with no blood supply of its own. It relies on movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a sponge, cartilage is compressed when we walk or load a joint, squeezing fluid out and then drawing fresh nutrients back in. Each step allows nutrients and natural lubricants to circulate and maintain joint health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is why the old idea of osteoarthritis as simple "wear and tear" is misleading. Joints are not car tires that inevitably grind down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osteoarthritis is better understood as a long process of wear and repair in which regular movement and exercise are critical to healing and to the health of the entire joint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_177108" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177108" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/WomenHoldingOntoHandLikeItsInPain-e1760056845637.jpg" alt="women holding onto her other hand like she's in pain" class="wp-image-177108 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-177108" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Osteoarthritis impacts the whole joint region. (SimpleImages/Moment/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A disease of the whole joint&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now know osteoarthritis is a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3295952/"&gt;whole-joint disease&lt;/a&gt;. It affects the joint fluid, the underlying bone, the ligaments, the surrounding muscles, and even the nerves that support movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic exercise targets all these elements. Muscle weakness, for instance, is one of the earliest signs of osteoarthritis and can be improved with resistance training. There is strong &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889857X12001299?via%3Dihub"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that muscle weakness increases the risk of both developing the disease and seeing it progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nerve and muscle control can also be trained through &lt;a href="https://www.jospt.org/doi/full/10.2519/jospt.2025.13041"&gt;neuromuscular exercise&lt;/a&gt; programs &lt;a href="https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12891-017-1439-y"&gt;such as GLA:D®&lt;/a&gt; (Good Life with osteoArthritis: Denmark) for hip and knee osteoarthritis. Usually delivered in supervised group sessions by physiotherapists, these programs focus on movement quality, balance, and strength to improve joint stability and rebuild confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant improvements in pain, joint function, and quality of life &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1063458421000339"&gt;have been recorded&lt;/a&gt; for up to 12 months after completing the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/do-your-knees-click-heres-what-it-means-and-when-to-see-a-doctor"&gt;Do Your Knees 'Click'? Here's What It Means, And When to See a Doctor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is good medicine for the whole body: it has documented benefits across more than &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26606383/"&gt;26 chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt;. In osteoarthritis, it helps not only by strengthening cartilage and muscle but also by tackling the inflammation, metabolic changes, and hormonal shifts that drive the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity is a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2596954/"&gt;major risk factor&lt;/a&gt; for osteoarthritis, and not merely because of the extra mechanical load on joints. High levels of inflammatory molecules in the blood and in joint tissues can degrade cartilage and accelerate disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For osteoarthritis, regular activity can counter this at a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9110817/#S1"&gt;molecular level&lt;/a&gt;, lowering inflammatory markers, limiting cell damage, and even altering gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise first, surgery later&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently there are no drugs that modify the course of osteoarthritis. Joint replacement surgery can be life-changing for some people, but it is major surgery and does not succeed for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise should be tried first and continued throughout every stage of the disease. It carries far fewer side effects and brings many additional health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Osteoarthritis is not simply a matter of "worn-out" joints. It is shaped by muscle strength, inflammation, metabolism, and lifestyle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular, targeted exercise addresses many of these factors at once – helping to protect cartilage, strengthen the whole joint and improve overall health. Before considering surgery, movement itself remains one of the most powerful treatments we have.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/260638/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Her family said that she was taken to McKay Dee Hospital, where she was diagnosed with the flu and adenovirus. Adenovirus has similar symptoms to the cold and flu and is also highly contagious.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her family added that the flu had gone around the family, starting around Christmas. At the beginning, Ellie was doing OK and seemed to be battling the flu pretty well. The entire family had similar symptoms, but Ellie developed a concerning cough, and Sarah Rudd, her mom, took her to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I took her in, (and) they kept her overnight because her oxygen was pretty low,” Sarah said, adding that they were preparing to be discharged until Ellie’s oxygen dropped again. Overnight, her condition worsened and she developed pneumonia and sepsis, requiring her to be life-flighted to Primary Children’s Hospital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A team of doctors worked to try to increase Ellie’s oxygen levels and blood pressure while she was in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think she was about four days in the PICU, and they took her in for a CAT scan the day that she died and saw that she had a stroke,” Sarah said. “They wouldn’t be able to fix it, so we made the decision to take her off life support, and she passed.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ellierudd2_GFMbg.jpg" class="fancybox"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ellierudd2_GFMbg.jpg" alt="Elora 'Ellie' Ann Rudd, a 4-year-old from Utah, passed away recently due to complications from the flu. | Courtesy GoFundMe" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-803945" srcset="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ellierudd2_GFMbg.jpg 900w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ellierudd2_GFMbg-300x200.jpg 300w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ellierudd2_GFMbg-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ellierudd2_GFMbg-860x573.jpg 860w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ellierudd2_GFMbg-750x500.jpg 750w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ellierudd2_GFMbg-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Elora ‘Ellie’ Ann Rudd, a 4-year-old from Utah, passed away recently due to complications from the flu. | Courtesy GoFundMe&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sarah and Michael, Ellie’s parents, are now speaking on their daughter’s life and how much she means to them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We named her after the character from (the film) ‘Willow’, the little baby. She was very much a nurturing little girl; she loved her baby dolls,” Sarah said. “She loved to put them to bed at night, put them down for naps. She loved Barbies. She loved ‘One Hundred and One Dalmatians’, and ‘Frozen’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sarah went on, “She was the sweetest little girl alive and would always come home from preschool and give me a present that she created in preschool. She was in school for speech therapy. … She was making bounds and leaps this year for it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Michael Rudd, Sarah’s father, said that Ellie was “always very sweet, always very sharing, very loving and affectionate.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“She loved to have dance parties in her sister’s room all the time. They would go and turn off all the lights and get dressed up,” Sarah added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point, the Rudds say they have more questions than answers, and one of those questions is most prominent in Sarah’s mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I just wonder, ‘Why her?’… I don’t know why it hit Ellie so hard,” Sarah said. The Rudds’ oldest daughter also caught pneumonia and bronchitis while the family was sick and was hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, their oldest is doing better, but the Rudd family is still left with the hole left by Ellie’s loss. Relatives of the Rudds created &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/honoring-the-life-and-legacy-of-ellie-rudd" target="_blank"&gt;a GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; to help support the family with funeral and medical costs and to help support them as they grieve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/honoring-the-life-and-legacy-of-ellie-rudd" target="_blank"&gt;CLICK HERE to donate to GoFundMe.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sarah concluded, “Hug your kids a little tighter, because you don’t know when the next day is the last day you can see them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>East Idaho News</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 21:59:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxQWEdUMl9HekQ1X0tUXy0wTVBVa3BtS25rNmlFMVdWZ2xMZVRYbkY5ZndUbHFOSTBVMk5FMnNCMWVmYWt0clhPRHQ1Y3NrX1MyR04ydG5iZ29tbVFoYlU1QjdsanlkeDZfWG96NzVfZkROZ2ZUd1c5N0RzWU8welpRVUZFRGpZYXZ6RnJtQ0Fnem5SYU81eEFWbFJLY2RHVDlhU050RWJnTkFpQV9SWWl2by1hX1ZzVFJwN1RpbDNzMVBwdw</guid></item><item><title>在伯克利无家可归者营地发现致命的细菌爆发- KTVU</title><link>https://www.ktvu.com/news/deadly-bacterial-outbreak-discovered-berkeley-homeless-encampment</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" data-v-6c8e215c&gt;&lt;div genres="News and Information" ismcvodvideo="true" class="featured featured-video video-ct" data-v-4292be72 data-v-6c8e215c&gt;&lt;div class="contain" data-v-4292be72&gt;  &lt;div class="info" data-v-4292be72&gt;&lt;div class="caption" data-v-4292be72&gt; &lt;p data-v-4292be72&gt;Berkeley city health officials issued a public health warning after staff discovered the presence of leptospirosis at a homeless encampment in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BERKELEY, Calif.&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;/span&gt;Berkeley city leadership issued a &lt;a href="https://berkeleyca.gov/sites/default/files/2026-01/January%2012%2C%202026%20Lepto%20Health%20Alert%20Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;public health warning&lt;/a&gt; on Monday after animals in a homeless encampment tested positive for leptospirosis, a bacterial disease that can be fatal in dogs and humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails" data-v-6c8e215c&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-js" data-v-6c8e215c&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-ad-pos="inread" data-ad-size="1x1" class="ad gpt" data-v-6c8e215c&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;City staff discovered the disease was present after testing animals in the vicinity of a homeless encampment on Harrison Street. Berkeley’s Public Health Officer recommended that encampment residents move out of the area as soon as possible, and relocate to at least a third of a mile away due to public health risk caused by the rat infestation transmitting the disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;"The absence of confirmed human cases is reassuring but does not remove the risk of undiagnosed cases or future cases," Noemi Doohan, Berkeley’s Public Health Officer said in a Jan. 6 court filing. "If a human case were confirmed, that would elevate the urgency of the recommended response to protect human life and other animal life in the city of Berkeley."&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;The city advises dog owners to vaccinate their pets against leptospirosis, and the wrote the owners of "free roaming cats" should consider the same.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;Signs of pet illness may include "excessive thirst, vomiting, shivering, and lethargy, and can progress to liver failure if untreated. Lepto can also be fatal to dogs."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;In humans, leptospirosis can cause sudden high fever, throbbing headache, severe calf/leg pain, and red eyes (conjunctivitis), the court documents state. Without treatment the disease can cause kidney damage, meningitis, liver failure, trouble breathing, and even death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;The disease may not be immediately recognizable by doctors either, as it is usually associated with tropical conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-6c8e215c&gt;Problem area&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;Rats and their urine are a common vector for the disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;"Current Harrison Street encampment conditions (tents, refuse, uncontained foods, RVs, standing water) prevent standard vector control teams from accessing and destroying rat nesting sites," the city alert states. "Rodent eradication, ongoing rat testing for leptospirosis, and remediation of the area to prevent a growing rat infestation is a medical and public health safety necessity that cannot be successfully completed while the encampment is occupied by temporary dwellings, people and dogs."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;In addition to pushing for Harrison Street residents to relocate, the city is also encouraging residents to take precautions by avoiding touching the water in Codornices Creek or walking or biking through standing water in the area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;The creek has not been tested for leptospirosis, but noted that the presence of the disease so close to the creek means there is a significant risk of the disease spreading to the creek and wildlife if the infected rodent population is not brought under control. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;Veterinarians treating sick dogs at the Harrison Street encampment first identified the disease in November, and Alameda County Vector Control confirmed the presence of leptospirosis by trapping and testing rats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;"This was of particular concern because testing of rats trapped at encampment over the last five years… had never previously produced any findings of leptospirosis in rats," the city’s health advisory states.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-6c8e215c&gt;What's next&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;Berkeley city staff have launched an ongoing public health investigation into the disease’s spread in the encampment and the nearby community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id="article-featured-image" class="article-featured-image"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/24725108-683x1024.jpg" alt="Dr Robert Jupiter. - "&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dr Robert Jupiter. - &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A PAIR of Trini-born US board-certified doctors has returned to the twin islands to set up a practice which focuses on obesity and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Called Stellar Medical, the practice is founded by husband and wife team Dr Robert Jupiter and Dr Karen Moses, a release said on January 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jupiter is a diplomate of the American Board of Family Medicine and Obesity Medicine and is a registered obesity medical specialist with the Medical Board of TT, while Dr Moses is a Fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are excited to return home after several years of study and practice in the US. This new chapter signals our focus on bringing science-based, stigma-free care to citizens of TT that addresses the biological, hormonal, and environmental drivers of weight gain and metabolic disease,” Jupiter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Obesity is not simply about willpower or eating less. It is a chronic metabolic disease that affects nearly every system in the body. Effective treatment must be compassionate, evidence-based, and tailored to each individual.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239531467-0"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release said Jupiter has expert guidance on GLP-1/GIP medications such as Wegovy, Ozempic, Zepbound and Mounjaro, which are generally more effective and better tolerated than older weight-loss drugs, with patients often losing 16 to 23 per cent of their total body weight, versus five to ten per cent with earlier treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although experienced with the new drugs, the release said Jupiter prefers exploring other options such as nutrition, movement, hydration, sleep and mental wellbeing before considering pharmaceutical options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is no “magic pill” to weight loss because obesity is a chronic condition where long-term care and ongoing support are often required,” Jupiter underscored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Shame and stigma often prevent people from seeking help. We work to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;create a judgment-free environment and, when needed, collaborate with therapists to address the emotional side of weight management.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;

The reason you decide to postpone household chores and &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sleep-procrastination-psychology-tips/"&gt;spend your time browsing social media&lt;/a&gt; could be explained by the workings of a &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/brains"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; circuit. Recent research has identified a neural connection responsible for delaying the start of activities associated with unpleasant experiences, even when these activities offer a clear reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The study, led by Ken-ichi Amemori, a neuroscientist at Kyoto University, aimed to analyze the brain mechanisms that reduce motivation to act when a task involves stress, punishment, or discomfort. To do this, the researchers designed an experiment with monkeys, a widely used model for understanding decisionmaking and motivation processes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The scientists worked with two macaques that were trained to perform various decisionmaking tasks. In the first phase of the experiment, after a period of water restriction, the animals could activate one of two levers that released different amounts of liquid; one option offered a smaller reward and the other a larger one. This exercise allowed them to evaluate how the value of the reward influences the willingness to perform an action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In a later stage, the experimental design incorporated an unpleasant element. The monkeys were given the choice of drinking a moderate amount of water without negative consequences or drinking a larger amount on the condition of receiving a direct blast of air in the face. Although the reward was greater in the second option, it involved an uncomfortable experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;As the researchers anticipated, the macaques' motivation to complete the task and access the water decreased considerably when the aversive stimulus was introduced. This behavior allowed them to identify a brain circuit that acts as a brake on motivation in the face of anticipated adverse situations. In particular, the connection between the ventral striatum and the ventral pallidum, two structures located in the basal ganglia of the brain, known for their role in regulating pleasure, motivation, and reward systems, was observed to be involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The neural analysis revealed that when the brain anticipates an unpleasant event or potential punishment, the ventral striatum is activated and sends an inhibitory signal to the ventral pallidum, which is normally responsible for driving the intention to perform an action. In other words, this communication reduces the impulse to act when the task is associated with a negative experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;The Brain Connection Behind Procrastination&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;To investigate the specific role of this connection, as described in the study published &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2025.12.035"&gt;in the journal Current Biology&lt;/a&gt;, researchers used a chemogenetic technique that, through the administration of a specialized drug, temporarily disrupted communication between the two brain regions. By doing so, the monkeys regained the motivation to initiate tasks, even in those tests that involved blowing air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Notably, the inhibitory substance produced no change in trials where reward was not accompanied by punishment. This result suggests that the EV-PV circuit does not regulate motivation in a general way, but rather is specifically activated to suppress it when there is an expectation of discomfort. In this sense, apathy toward unpleasant tasks appears to develop gradually as communication between these two regions intensifies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Beyond explaining why people tend to unconsciously resist starting household chores or uncomfortable obligations, the findings have relevant implications for understanding disorders such as &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/depression/"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mutations-in-a-single-gene-have-been-linked-to-mental-illness/"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, in which patients often experience a significant loss of the drive to act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;However, Amemori emphasizes that this circuit serves an essential protective function. “Overworking is very dangerous. This circuit protects us from burnout,” he said in comments reported by Nature. Therefore, he cautions that any attempt to externally modify this neural mechanism must be approached with care, as further research is needed to avoid interfering with the brain's natural protective processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared in &lt;a href="https://es.wired.com/articulos/neurocientificos-descifran-la-procrastinacion-un-mecanismo-cerebral-explica-por-que-dejamos-ciertas-tareas-para-despues"&gt;WIRED en Español&lt;/a&gt; and has been translated from Spanish.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 20:09:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxPMVQ4OWVYX194ZnFoYzBWWmFwbHlKQmVkNEQ5bHZMM1drMU5SWDNRTm1Eb0RVSDY4Vlg3WUhlamVzOU1ZWmYzblktMVdqMURLbWc1QWdKWWZnMGJTSmFIMHBIOHQ4LUhwazllLWp3VExwdHc3ek5XZm1xZ2Y4Yi1QdWlWUVBSbHpmTVVQYVRXaExodw</guid></item><item><title>营养师评选的9种最佳高蛋白酸奶- TODAY.com</title><link>https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/best-high-protein-yogurts-rcna254046</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e46158" class="body-graf"&gt;Yogurt is one of the easiest ways to add protein to your day, without any cooking required. Whether you’re blending it into smoothies, spooning it on top of granola or using it as a savory substitute for sour cream, high-protein yogurt can help keep you fuller longer, support muscle recovery and make meals more satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5f6891" class="body-graf"&gt;But not all yogurts are created equal. Some are loaded with added sugar, while others fall short on protein. If you're not sure which yogurt to pick in the dairy aisle, look no further than this list. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-210c26" class="body-graf"&gt;I taste-tested and scoured the nutrition facts on many yogurts to create a list of my top picks. I factor in protein content, ingredient quality, taste and overall versatility. These are the high-protein yogurts I consistently recommend, plus a few strong runners-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-5320d8" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to Look for in a High-Protein Yogurt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7304b5" class="body-graf"&gt;When shopping for high-protein yogurt, keep these key criteria in mind:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-80e629" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein content:&lt;/strong&gt; Aim for at least 12–15 grams of protein per serving. Greek yogurt and skyr tend to deliver the most protein, thanks to their straining process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal added sugar:&lt;/strong&gt; Plain yogurts are ideal, but if you choose flavored, look for options with reduced or no added sugars. Less sugar makes it easier to enjoy yogurt daily without going over the daily added sugar recommendations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fat level that fits your needs:&lt;/strong&gt; Nonfat, low-fat and whole milk yogurts can all be healthy choices. The “best” option depends on satiety, taste preference and how it fits into your daily calorie goals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taste:&lt;/strong&gt; Nutrition is important, but so is the flavor of the yogurt. Of course, taste is a personal preference, but I argue that these are some of the best-tasting high-protein yogurts in stores now. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-32e394" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Plain Greek Yogurt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="anchor-66f53b" class="body-heading"&gt;Fage Total 0%&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_noCaption__qtPhQ" id="anchor-3ebcd7"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1024" data-original-width="1024"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2026-01/fage-total-0-0ed5dc.png 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/fage-total-0-0ed5dc.png 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2026-01/fage-total-0-0ed5dc.png 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/fage-total-0-0ed5dc.png 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/fage-total-0-0ed5dc.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Fage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-405709" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://usa.fage/products/yogurt/fage-total-0" target="_blank"&gt;Fage Total 0%&lt;/a&gt; is a classic for a reason.

Firefighters have an increased risk of lung cancer, including adenocarcinoma, due to inhaling carcinogens like smoke and other toxins from burning materials, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/occupational-lung-diseases/firefighters-lung-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Lung Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American Lung Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Following his diagnosis, Jones’ doctors informed him that he requires a specific course of treatment that includes chemotherapy and immunotherapy. However, his insurance provider, Blue Shield of California, reportedly denied coverage, as well as an appeal filed by Jones’ oncologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a statement to PEOPLE, a spokesperson for Blue Shield declined to comment on the denial of coverage, citing patient privacy laws. However, they provided the criteria used to determine authorization and encouraged members to reach out with any concerns about their coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On Thursday, Jan. 8, Jones’ wife, Helen, and daughter, Rachel, spoke at San Francisco City Hall and asked the city’s Health Service Board to take action against Blue Shield. The city is responsible for negotiating its public servants’ health insurance contracts, and the board oversees that relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Today, I am forced to stand here and beg because an insurance company decided that profits matter more than the life of a man who spent his career protecting this city,” said Rachel, in tears. “Blue Shield has decided that my father’s life is not worth paying for.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-puzzler-8620185" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here!

Both are physicians who have publicly disputed prevailing scientific views on vaccines and the use of antidepressants during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kennedy announced on Tuesday that the two doctors will join the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP), which advises the CDC on vaccine recommendations. The additions bring the committee’s membership to 13, following Kennedy’s controversial decision in June to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/09/rfk-cdc-panel-vaccines-removed" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;dismiss the previous panel&lt;/a&gt; and replace it with 11 new members of his choosing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The newly appointed members are Dr Adam Urato, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist with academic experience at Harvard Medical School and Tufts University, and Dr Kimberly Biss, who has held leadership roles at Bayfront Health in Florida and has published research examining Covid-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/secretary-kennedy-appoints-two-ob-gyns-cdc-advisory-committee-immunization-practices.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; announcing the appointments, Kennedy praised their qualifications. “ACIP serves as Americans’ watchdog for vaccine safety and transparency,” Kennedy said. “Dr Urato and Dr Biss bring the scientific credentials, clinical experience, and integrity this committee requires.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Appearing to align with Kennedy’s own views, Biss has been outspoken in her criticism of Covid vaccines. During testimony before a Republican-led House subcommittee in 2023, she said patients in her practice experienced significant menstrual irregularities after vaccination, some of which she said were severe enough to require surgeries and hysterectomies. Her claims were &lt;a href="https://pauloffit.substack.com/p/vaccine-safetyby-marjorie-taylor" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;met with pushback&lt;/a&gt; from other medical experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Her skepticism has extended beyond congressional testimony. In a December 2022 &lt;a href="https://www.learnpolishpodcast.com/195-womens-health-risk-harmed-by-design-what-we-can-do-to-protect-it-dr-kimberly-biss/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;podcast interview&lt;/a&gt;, Biss said “prior to Covid I was not an anti-vaxxer, but I am now because I’ve gone down the rabbit hole, and I would love to be able someday to meet Robert F Kennedy Jr.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Biss &lt;a href="https://rumble.com/v2r9elx-ob-gyn-dr.-kimberly-biss-i-was-not-anti-vaccine-i-am-now.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;echoed those remarks&lt;/a&gt; at a May 2023 panel hosted by the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation, an organization critical of coronavirus vaccines, stating, “I was not anti-vaccine. I am now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Last October, Biss appeared on a &lt;a href="https://ket.org/program/kentucky-tonight/vaccines-and-medications/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;panel discussion&lt;/a&gt; where she argued against what she described as a reflexive dismissal of alternative medical perspectives. She cited skepticism of vaccine safety and referenced guidance from the Trump administration advising pregnant women to avoid Tylenol due to potential autism links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Most &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/24/world-health-organization-trump-autism-tylenol" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;scientific evidence&lt;/a&gt; indicates moderate Tylenol use during pregnancy is safe and does not demonstrate a connection to autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Urato has similarly challenged mainstream medical conclusions. He has &lt;a href="https://x.com/AdamUrato1/status/1845461085106626880" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;questioned the safety&lt;/a&gt; of vaccines given during pregnancy. He has also raised concerns about antidepressant use in pregnancy, particularly a class known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. Urato &lt;a href="https://x.com/AdamUrato1/status/1973157978930028720" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;petitioned&lt;/a&gt; the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to require warning labels on SSRIs, arguing they cause pregnancy complications and affect fetal brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKQLRuYZ87E" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;podcast interview&lt;/a&gt; last June, Urato said there was a “huge problem” with “over-intervention in medicine”, adding that he believes there is “too much testing, too many drugs, too many vaccines”. He later compared vaccine makers with cigarette manufacturers, accusing them of trying to intentionally “underplay the risks”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Protect Our Care, a healthcare advocacy group, sharply criticized the health secretary’s new appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The more RFK Jr stacks his immunization advisory panel with anti-vaccine activists, the more its recommendations will undermine our public health to advance conspiracy theories and anti-science ideology,” Kayla Hancock, director of Public Health Watch, a project of Protect Our Care, said in &lt;a href="https://www.protectourcare.org/rfk-jr-packs-acip-with-even-more-vaccine-skeptics-setting-stage-for-more-dangerous-and-unfounded-attacks-on-our-public-health/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“One of secretary Kennedy’s new ACIP members is perhaps best known for spreading misinformation that the Covid vaccine is somehow magically contagious to unvaccinated women – flying in the face of scientific evidence,” she added. “It’s clear secretary Kennedy is only comfortable in an anti-vax echo chamber with as little input as possible from respected medical experts and peer-reviewed data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 17:37:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxOZlRlaXpVOFozVWlTUUFNdDBXbklKVmRtdFpfVUtTZWJOVGQ4dGZiSWtlV3Zlb1BLemtaeWdyTlJkbnU0SmVyWkpVR0xuNkhsN1Y4WllkTVJxbHNvSlNvUjFqVDMtb0xxY1ZrSXVGOEpTdnp2b2xhblZZQmEwWjF6SjB2Uno</guid></item><item><title>美国疫苗接种率低的漏洞越来越大，风险也越来越高- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/14/health/vaccine-exemptions-county-risk-measles-vis</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Opting out of childhood vaccines is becoming more common across most of the United States, leaving larger shares of the population vulnerable to preventable diseases like measles, which is continuing its record-breaking spread across the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo00043b6pq2cp7ljv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Exemption rates for vaccines that are typically required to attend&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;school have increased in more than half of US counties since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to new &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2025.24407?guestAccessKey=310c24bc-8a41-42b2-9d62-9cc5824b4882&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=011426" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday in the medical journal JAMA.

            What’s driving the trend: nonmedical reasons for exemptions — often described as religious or personal beliefs. However, exemptions for medical reasons – among those who are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-best-practices/contraindications-precautions.html" target="_blank"&gt;immunocompromised&lt;/a&gt;, for example, or those who have a severe allergy to a vaccine component or – have remained stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The science behind immunizations has not changed in the past five years,” said ​Dr. Jesse Hackell, a pediatrician in New York. He is the lead author of a &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/156/2/e2025072714/202656/Medical-vs-Nonmedical-Immunization-Exemptions-for" target="_blank"&gt;policy statement&lt;/a&gt; from the American Academy of Pediatrics that says that nonmedical exemptions to school immunization requirements should be eliminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo00063b6pydv0pdc4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What has changed is the politics and the misinformation behind the discussion,” Hackell said. “But the science about the immunizations — that they’re safe, that they’re effective, that they reduce disease, that they reduce morbidity and mortality – there are no changes in that science.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In the new analysis, researchers compared the average rate of vaccine exemptions among kindergartners at the county level during a period before the Covid-19 pandemic to more recent years. Nearly 90% of counties had sufficient data to be included in the analysis. They found that the median rate of nonmedical exemptions increased from an average of 0.6% in 2010-2011 to more than 3% in 2023-2024, while medical exemptions remained stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo00083b6p8iwe2rjr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About 53.5% of US counties saw nonmedical vaccine exemptions rise at least 1% when comparing between 2010-2020 and 2021-2024, and more than 5% — about 1 in every 20 counties — saw nonmedical exemptions rise at least 5% in that time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke9vbei00003b6rqjkok1nu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the increase in vaccine exemptions may be “due to an increase in vaccine hesitancy.” A &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/pubs-resources/parental-attitudes-toward-vaccination-requirements.html" target="_blank"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; of parents conducted by the agency in the summer of 2024 found that most supported vaccine requirements to attend school. But among those seeking an exemption, the most commonly reported reason – cited more than a third of the time – was a philosophical or personal belief objection to vaccination. Difficulty meeting school requirements by the deadline was also reported as a reason for exemption by about 23% of parents. Medical reasons were cited by more than a quarter of parents, but the CDC said that might include parents who consider concerns about vaccine safety or side effects as a “medical” reason to request an exemption.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo00093b6pb0g70p89@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Nathan Lo, an infectious disease physician and scientist with Stanford and author of the new research, says that small differences in vaccine coverage can make a big impact — and understanding local trends is important.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo000a3b6px2c1lpt2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you look at national trends, or even state level trends, in many ways they’re very optimistic because they miss whole pockets of communities and counties where vaccine coverage may be low and vaccine exemptions may be high,” Lo said. “Really it’s those pockets that drive the outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases that we see across the nation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo000b3b6pn9q76t9l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Spartanburg County, South Carolina – the center of a large, ongoing measles outbreak – nearly 8% of children had nonmedical exemptions for vaccines that are required to attend school in 2024, up from 2% in 2014, the new research shows.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo000c3b6pfxhwiwtg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The South Carolina measles outbreak has doubled in size over the past week, with state health officials now reporting more than 400 cases. At least 400 others remain in quarantine after they were exposed to a known measles case without the protection of vaccination, and the state health department expects more cases to come from that group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo000d3b6prsv5j4qs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The outbreak has been growing rapidly since early October. Exposures have been reported at multiple schools, churches and other public locations over the past few months. The latest public exposures include the South Carolina State Museum in Columbia, which is one of the state’s most populous cities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo000e3b6p11efzoc3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The state health department says that holiday activities — including school breaks, gatherings and travel — have contributed to the spread of the outbreak, particularly in areas with lagging vaccination rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo000f3b6py0ewmyvl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The (undervaccinated) pockets are all interconnected,” Lo said, through geographic proximity and the nature of our society. “When you think about the places with really large (vaccine exemption rates), I think the pockets are getting a little bit bigger and are becoming more numerous.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo000g3b6pzvr4j50o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vast majority of measles cases in the current outbreak have been among children (92%) and nearly all have been unvaccinated with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to data shared by the state health department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo000h3b6p7bufzqo7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Communities with particularly high exemption rates — and, therefore, lower vaccination rates — are most susceptible to a “localized epidemic” of preventable infectious diseases, Hackell said. But it raises the risk for others, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo000i3b6p0xh3ftmr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you’ve got a whole bunch of kids in one of these counties with high exemption rates who are getting sick and have the opportunity to travel the surrounding areas, even those counties with lower exemption rates are going to see a rise in cases,” he said. “You’ve got a lot more people around who can spread the diseases to people who may be susceptible.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo000j3b6pf0j5rcp9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Multiple cases in North Carolina have been linked to family travel to Spartanburg County, South Carolina, and the New Mexico health department warned of possible measles exposure in Albuquerque from someone visiting from South Carolina.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo000k3b6pkjwccmkd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A handful of states, including California, Connecticut, Maine and New York, have passed laws that remove the option for nonmedical vaccine exemptions. The new research shows that counties in these states saw a decrease in overall exemptions, or essentially an increase in vaccine coverage. Florida, on the other hand, has recently moved to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/03/health/florida-vaccine-mandates"&gt;end all vaccine mandates&lt;/a&gt; in the state, including for children to attend school.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo000l3b6pfglxjpbn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say that legislative action is the only large-scale intervention that has been shown to effectively change vaccination trends. Instead, increasing vaccination coverage will depend more on individual conversations between families and their doctors and consistent messaging over time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo000m3b6potocyd0t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The vast majority of parents in most places choose to immunize,” Hackell said. Nationally, 3.6% of kindergartners in the 2024-25 school year had an exemption for a required vaccine, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/31/health/vaccination-school-requirements-cdc"&gt;federal data shows&lt;/a&gt; — but that means that more than 96% were vaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo000n3b6ptnv2cwyd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A parent who chooses to vaccinate their child is not being careless or thoughtless or weird,” he said. “The social norm is to immunize and protect your child and, by extension, protect the children around them. The social norm is vastly in favor of immunizations, and that reflects the science.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Some people can get drunk without consuming alcohol. While that might sound like the ultimate life hack to some, it’s actually a rare medical condition called auto-brewery syndrome (ABS) that’s difficult to diagnose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-025-02225-y"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published Thursday in the journal &lt;em data-start="118" data-end="139"&gt;Nature Microbiology&lt;/em&gt;, researchers pinpointed gut bacteria and biological pathways that trigger alcohol production in ABS, shedding light on an often misunderstood syndrome. A &lt;a href="https://taylorandfrancis.com/knowledge/Medicine_and_healthcare/Physiology/Biological_pathway/"&gt;biological pathway&lt;/a&gt; is a series of biochemical processes that carry out functions in a cell or organism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“By determining the specific bacteria and microbial pathways responsible, our findings may lead the way toward easier diagnosis, better treatments, and an improved quality of life for individuals living with this rare condition,” Elizabeth Hohmann, co-senior author of the study from the Infectious Disease Division in the Mass General Brigham Department of Medicine, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260113220920.htm"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; by Mass General Brigham.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Poop samples&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;ABS occurs when particular gut microbes convert carbohydrates into ethanol—an alcohol that then enters the bloodstream. Anyone’s digestion can produce small amounts of alcohol; ABS can make a person noticeably drunk. Diagnostic issues, social stigma, and limited awareness often leave the condition undiagnosed, according to the researchers. Diagnosis is complicated because the standard method requires closely monitored blood alcohol testing, which is often hard to get.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In fact, many patients go undiagnosed for years, often facing medical complications, social stress, and legal problems. Imagine being charged with drunk driving without having consumed alcohol!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hohmann and her colleagues investigated the gut microbes of 22 people with ABS, 21 household partners without ABS, and 22 healthy control individuals. They found that stool (poop) samples from patients during ABS flare-ups produced ethanol to a significantly greater extent than the samples from the other two groups. This points to the potential for creating a stool test that could lead to more reliable diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Bacteria involved in ABS&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stool analysis indicated that several bacteria, such as &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;, play major roles in ABS. Furthermore, when symptoms flared, some participants revealed significantly greater amounts of enzymes related to pathways of fermentation than members of the control group. However, the team reports that finding the specific microbes that cause ABS in individual people is still a long and complicated endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The scientists also worked with a patient whose symptoms improved after a &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/25202-fecal-transplant"&gt;fecal transplant&lt;/a&gt; (putting someone else’s medically processed sample of feces into the gut) and had ameliorated symptoms. Other previous approaches had not been successful. Shifts in particular bacterial strains and metabolic activity in the individual’s gut aligned with their relapse and recovery, further supporting the biological basis of the syndrome. A second transplant with a differing antibiotic pretreatment saw the patient remain without symptoms for over 16 months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Auto-brewery syndrome is a misunderstood condition with few tests and treatments. Our study demonstrates the potential for fecal transplantation,” explained Hohmann, who is participating in another study investigating fecal transplantation in ABS patients.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

Young mice were used at 12 weeks of age or roughly 12 weeks of age (12–14 weeks). Aged mice were used at 72–76 weeks of age. &lt;i&gt;Trim63&lt;/i&gt; mutant mice were generated by Cyagen using CRISPR–Cas mediated genome engineering to delete exons 1–8. The mutant line was maintained as heterozygous and &lt;i&gt;Trim63&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;+/−&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Trim63&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;i&gt;/&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;−&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; were used as &lt;i&gt;Trim63&lt;/i&gt; knockout in our study. The &lt;i&gt;Trim63&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;+/+&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; generated from the heterozygous breeding scheme were used as wild-type controls. &lt;i&gt;Foxo1 mck&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;cre&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice were a generous gift from M. Febbraio (Monash University) and were bred in our colony with the following breeding scheme: &lt;i&gt;Foxo1 mck&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;cre+&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; × &lt;i&gt;Foxo1 mck&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;cre−&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cre+&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;cre&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;−&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; littermates were used for experiments. &lt;i&gt;Foxo1 Myh6cre&lt;/i&gt; mice were generated from a series of crosses using our floxed &lt;i&gt;Foxo1&lt;/i&gt; mice to &lt;i&gt;B6/FVB-Tg(MyH6-cre_2182Mds/J)&lt;/i&gt; from Jackson Laboratories (011038). All experiments were performed in our AAALAC-certified vivarium, with approval from The Salk Institute Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). In accordance with our IACUC guidelines, in an effort to reduce the number of animals used for our experiments, where possible and appropriate, experiments were done in parallel and shared controls were used. This is indicated in the figure legends where relevant. Mice were housed with a 12-h light/dark cycle, humidity 30–70% and temperature of 18–26 °C (64–79 °F).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec11"&gt;Bacteria&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria used were &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; O21:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 43" title="Ayres, J.

The next day, a single colony of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; O21:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was inoculated into LB-AVNM media. A single colony of &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; was inoculated into LB without antibiotics. Both cultures were shaken overnight at 37 °C (250 rpm). The following morning, the optical density was measured and an inoculum with a 1:1 mixture of the bacteria was prepped with the appropriate amount of both bacteria in sterile 1× PBS that was used directly for mouse infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec14"&gt;Mouse infection models&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were infected intraperitoneally with the appropriate dose of bacteria and put back into their home cage. Mice were group housed for the experiments. For LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; experiments the dose of total bacteria used was 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; CFU. This dose was titrated up or down for low dose and high dose models. Inoculums were serially diluted and plated to confirm the infectious doses. Immediately after infection, food was removed for the first 10–12 h postinfection to control for any potential variations in the sickness-induced anorexic response. Mice were clinically monitored as described below every 2 h postinfection. For some experiments, mice were clinically monitored every 2 h for the first 10–12 h postinfection and then again at 24 h. For experiments involving inhibitors, the details are provided below. Mice that reached clinical endpoints were euthanized according to our animal protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec15"&gt;Survival&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were clinically monitored as described below every 2 h postinfection. For some experiments, mice were clinically monitored every 2 h for the first 10–12 h postinfection and then again at 24 h. Mice that had to be euthanized because they reached clinical endpoints during the infection, in addition to those that succumb to the infection, were included in our survival counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec16"&gt;Rectal temperature&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rectal temperatures were taken every 2 h postinfection for the first 10–12 h, and then every 24 h as noted using the Digisense Type J/K/T thermocouple meter. Temperatures are shown as temperatures over time, temperatures at a defined time point or the minimal temperature shown by the animals over the course of the infection. This is indicated in the figure legends. Rectal temperatures were also used to calculate health scores to generate health trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec17"&gt;Grading system for monitoring morbidity&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use the following morbidity scale to quantify the morbidity of mice. Infected mice are clinically assessed using this morbidity scale every 2 h postinfection. For some experiments, mice were clinically monitored every 2 h for the first 10–12 h postinfection and then again at 24 h. Morbidity scores are shown as scores over time, scores at a defined time point or the maximal morbidity shown during the infection (the lower the score, the greater the morbidity). This is indicated in the figure legends. Morbidity scores were also used to calculate health scores to generate health trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(5) Normal. Normal exploratory behaviour, rearing on bind limbs and grooming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(4) Mild. Reduced exploratory behaviour, rearing on bind limbs and grooming. Slower and/or less stead gait, but free ambulation throughout the cage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(3) Moderate. Limited voluntary movement. Slow, unsteady gait for less than 5 s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2) Severe. No voluntary movement, but mouse can generate slow, unsteady gait for more than 5 s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1) Moribund. Mouse does not move away from stimulation by research but can still right itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(0) Deceased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec18"&gt;Generating health trajectories&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rectal temperatures were assigned bin scores based on the following strategy. The sum of the temperature bin score (below) and morbidity score (above) for each mouse at each time point was determined to generate health scores. Mice that were deceased or were euthanized because they reached clinical endpoint were assigned a score of 0. Health scores were then plotted against time to generate the health trajectories. Temperature bin scores: (5) 35–&amp;gt;38 °C, (4) 31–34.9 °C; (3) 28–30.9 °C, (2) 25–27.9 °C, (1) 22–24.9 °C and (0) lower than 22 °C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec19"&gt;MRI&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine and Echo MRI body composition software v.2008.01.18M were used for MRI measurements. The MRI produces a total amount of fat (g), total lean muscle (g) and total water (g) per mouse. Both the total fat and lean were normalized to the total body weight (g) of the mouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec20"&gt;Heart weights&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight-matched mice were used for heart weight analyses for young mice and when possible for aged mice. The body cavity was opened, hearts were removed from the body cavity and blood was drained from the chambers. The heart was then placed on a scale and the weight was recorded. Heart weights were normalized to body weights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec21"&gt;Heart pictures&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For heart pictures, the body cavity was opened, hearts were removed from the body cavity, blood was drained from the chambers and a picture was taken of the heart with a reference ruler using an iPhone SE 2020 or a rose gold iPhone 11 Promax. For presentation purposes, heart images were scaled, cropped and placed on a uniform background using Photopea as follows: using the reference ruler, each image was scaled to the same size. Hearts were then cropped using a polygonal lasso select tool with 1 pixel feathering and placed on top of an aquamarine background. A 3-mm scale bar is provided in each figure based on the reference ruler in the images. Uncropped images are included in Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09923-x#MOESM1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec22"&gt;Histology&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart, spleen, lungs, liver and kidneys were harvested and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Lungs were inflated by injecting the lobes with 1× PBS before fixation. Then samples were routinely processed, paraffin embedded, sectioned at 4–5 μm and haematoxylin and eosin stained. Tissues were evaluated by a board certified veterinary pathologist who was blinded to mouse genotype, age and experimental manipulation, and scored semi-quantitatively for the following parameters: oedema (defined as separation of cardiomyocytes by clear to pale eosinophilic material); heart congestion or haemorrhage (defined as blood vessels expanded by erythrocytes in the myocardium and/or extravascular red blood cells); changes to the cardiomyocytes of the myocardium including pallor and/or cytoplasmic vacuolation, disorganization and/or hypereosinophilia with or without increased size, loss of nuclear detail or loss of cross striations; increased leukocytes within the vessels and parenchyma of the heart; spleen congestion (expansion of the red pulp sinuses by erythrocytes); liver congestion or haemorrhage (expanded sinusoids and/or extravascular red blood cells); increased leukocytes within the sinusoids and parenchyma of the liver; congestion and leucocyte infiltration of the lung interstitium; and kidney congestion (expanded vascular spaces in the cortex and medulla). These parameters were scored on a scale of 0–4 with 0 representing normal tissue; 1 representing minimal changes; 2 representing mild changes; 3 representing moderate changes and 4 representing severe changes relative to a score of 1. Representative images were obtained from glass slides using NIS-Elements BR 3.2 64-bit and plated in Adobe Photoshop CC 2015 and/or Adobe Photoshop 2019. Image white balance, lighting and/or contrast was adjusted using corrections applied to the entire image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec23"&gt;Quantification of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; O21:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; in mouse tissues&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For quantification of pathogen in tissues, CFUs were quantified. Spleen, kidney, liver, lung and heart were harvested and homogenized in sterile 1× PBS with 1% Triton X-100 using a BeadMill 24 bench-top bead-based homogenizer (Fisher Scientific). Homogenates were serially diluted and plated on LB agar and EMB-AVNM agar and incubated at 37 °C. Colonies were quantified the following day. The limit of detection for the liver was 50 CFU and 100 CFU for all other tissues examined. Any sample with values below the limit of detection are indicated on the plots as ‘X BLD’ where X indicates the number of mice that had values below the limit of detection for that tissue. Data are plotted as geometric mean ± standard deviation as indicated in the figure legends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec24"&gt;Thermal neutrality experiments&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiment was performed in a temperature-controlled housing unit (thermal cabinet), purchased from Columbus instruments (model no. ENC52). Mice were housed in the thermal cabinet set to 30 °C, 4 days before infection. At the time of infection, mice were fasted and food was given back 24 h later. Mouse weight, temperature and morbidity were measured every 2 h during the first day of infection. Mice were tracked for survival on subsequent days. A set of control mice were infected at room temperature with the same dose, fasted for 24 h, measured every 2 h during the first day and tracked for survival on subsequent days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec25"&gt;FoxO1 inhibitor infection model&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FoxO1 inhibitor AS1842856 (End Millipore) was injected into mice intraperitoneally at a dose of 40–60 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; body weight 36 h before infection and immediately after infection on the opposite side of bacterial injection. Control mice were injected with vehicle. Mice were infected, clinically monitored and used for downstream analyses as described throughout the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09923-x#Sec9"&gt;Methods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec26"&gt;MuRF1 inhibitor infection model&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old mice were orally gavaged with 30 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; body weight of the MuRF1 inhibitor EMBL (European Molecular Biology Laboratory) CAS 445222-91-3 (Glixx Laboratories) or vehicle as control 12 h before infection. Mice were then infected with polymicrobial sepsis as described above and 2 h postinfection were gavaged with a second dose of the inhibitor or vehicle. Mice were infected, clinically monitored and used for downstream analyses as described throughout methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec27"&gt;Leg muscle measurements&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were euthanized, and the quadricep, tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, soleus and the gastrocnemius were harvested and weighed to determine the mass of each muscle. Muscle weights were then normalized to the body weight and are shown in the figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec28"&gt;Homeostatic mouse monitoring&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For young and old mouse homeostatic mouse data, mice were weighed daily over the course of ten consecutive days for total body weight tracking. Lean mass, fat mass, free water and total water were determined using Echo MRI. For food consumption, mice were single caged for 48 h before food was weighed every 24 h for 2 consecutive days at the same time of day. Food consumption over the 2 days was averaged to report a grams per day average. For rectal temperature, temperature was measured 3 times per day over a consecutive 5-day period at the same time of day using the Digisense Type J/K/T thermocouple meter. The averages of the three time points per mouse per day were reported. For dissections, mice were euthanized, blood was collected by cardiac puncture and serum stored at −80 °C for future analysis as previously described. Liver, kidney, lung, heart and spleen were harvested and weighed to determine the mass of each organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec29"&gt;Blood pressure&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The non-invasive CODA monitor was used to quantify mean blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure. Mice were placed in a restrainer and warmed on a far infrared warming platform while recording. The average of 10–15 recordings per mouse per parameter was reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec30"&gt;Troponin ELISA&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serum from mice infected with polymicrobial sepsis was harvested by cardiac puncture. Troponin I amounts were measured using an ultra-sensitive mouse cardiac troponin I enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Life Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Plates were read on a VERSAmax microplate reader manufactured by Molecular Devices and data analysis was done using SoftMax Pro v.5.4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec31"&gt;In vivo metabolic measurements&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the glucose tolerance test, mice were fasted overnight (12 h). Tail tips were cut using a razor blade for blood glucose monitoring using the Nova Max Plus glucose monitoring system. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 2 g kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of glucose (in PBS) based on total body weight. Blood glucose was measured at 0 (before glucose treatment), 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 60 min, 90 min and 120 min postinjection. Blood glucose was normalized to percent of time 0, and plotted in Prism where the area under the curve was calculated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec32"&gt;Quantification of whole body metabolic parameters&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For quantification of VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, mice were single caged in metabolic cages within a comprehensive laboratory animal monitoring system Oxymax for Windows v.5.64 24 h before metabolic parameter data collection. Mice were left untouched for roughly 3 days for data collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec33"&gt;qPCR&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For hearts, livers, spleens, kidneys and lungs, organs were harvested and then frozen at −80 °C. They were then homogenized into a tissue powder in liquid nitrogen. The powder was used for subsequent RNA extraction, using the Allprep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. For leg muscles, the tissues were harvested and then frozen at −80 °C. They were then homogenized into a tissue powder in liquid nitrogen. Ground muscle tissue powder was added to cold screw cap tube with bead in liquid nitrogen and then homogenized with 800 μl of TRIzol LS Reagent (Invitrogen). Then 160 μl of chloroform (TCI) was added and shaken by hand for 15 s and incubated at room temperature for 3 min. The TRIzol/chloroform lysate was transferred to 1.5-ml tubes and spun in a fume hood centrifuge for 15 min at maximum speed (14,000 rpm). The upper aqueous phase was transferred to a new 1.5-ml tube and 400 μl of isopropanol was added and mixed. The samples were held in a −20 °C freezer for a minimum of 2 h. The samples were added to an Allprep RNeasy spin column (Qiagen) and spun at max speed for 1 min, the flow through was discarded. The samples were then processed according to the Allprep RNA (Qiagen) extraction protocol resulting in 60 μl of diluted muscle RNA. Complementary DNA was generated using SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Two-step quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT–qPCR) was performed using a QuantStudio5 Real-Time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems) and the QuantStudio5 Design and Analysis software v.1.5.0. Primers sequences are listed in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09923-x#MOESM1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09923-x#MOESM1"&gt;Supplementary Information&lt;/a&gt;. The annealing temperature used was 60 °C for &lt;i&gt;Trim63&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Fbxo32&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rps17&lt;/i&gt;. A temperature of 58 °C was used for &lt;i&gt;Foxo1&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec34"&gt;BNP and GAL3 quantification&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood was collected by cardiac puncture and serum was stored at −80 °C as described above. For analysis, serum was defrosted and BNP and GAL3 were quantified by a BNP (Cusabio) and GAL3 (Invitrogen) ELISA kit. Samples were diluted at 1:2 for BNP, and at 1:100 to 1:300 for GAL3, and the ELISA was run as specified by both manufacturer’s protocols. Plates were read on a VERSAmax microplate reader manufactured by Molecular Devices and data analysis was done using SoftMax Pro v.5.4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec35"&gt;Western blot analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart tissue powder were homogenized in 700 μl of Tissue Extraction Reagent II supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (100:1) using a BeadMill 24 bench-top bead-based homogenizer (Fisher Scientific). Lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 27,000 rpm and transferred to a new tube. Samples were quantified with a bicinchoninic acid reaction and subjected to western blot analysis of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (14C10) tabbit monoclonal antibody Cell Signaling 21185 (1:1,000), Phospho-FoxOl (Thr24)/FoxO3a (Thr32) antibody Cell Signaling 94645 (1:1,000), Phospho-FoxOI (Ser256) antibody Cell Signaling 9461 (1:1,000), FoxOl (C29H4) rabbit monoclonal antibody Cell Signaling 28805 (1:1,000), anti-rabbit lgG HRP-linked antibody Cell Signaling 70745 (1:3,000). Samples were mixed with 15 μl of a 1:10 mixture of 2-mercaptoethanol to NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer (4×) (Invitrogen), then incubated at 70 °C for 10 min and sonicated in a water bath for 10 min. Samples were loaded equally in 7% NuPAGE 1.0 mm × 12 well Tris-acetate gels with 4 °C Tris-acetate SDS running buffer (50 ml 20× Tris-acetate SDS in 950 ml deionized H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) for 60 min at 150 V. Gels were placed on Trans-Blot Turbo Midi 0.2 µm Nitrocellulose Transfer Packs (Bio-Rad) and inserted into Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad) for 10 min. Membranes were stained with Ponceau Total Protein Stain (Prometheus) to be marked, washed with 1× TBST to destain and placed into blocking solution (5% BSA in 1× TBST) on a shaker platform overnight at 4 °C. Blocking solution was removed and primary antibody solutions were added to membranes (1:1,000 antibody in Prometheus OneBlock Western-CL Blocking Buffer) and placed on a shaker platform overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibody solutions were removed and membranes were washed on a shaker platform for 5 min with 1× TBST, which was repeated 4 times at room temperature. Secondary antibody solution was added containing 1:3,000 anti-rabbit IgG HRP-linked antibody in blocking buffer (5% BSA in 1× TBST) and membranes were placed on a shaker platform for 1 h at room temperature. Secondary antibody solutions were removed and membranes were washed again on a shaker platform for 5 min with 1× TBST, which was repeated 4 times at room temperature. Nitrocellulose blots were developed using a mixture of Femto and Dura chemiluminescent reaction and visualized with a Bio-Rad Gel Doc XR+ Gel Documentation System and Image Lab software v.5.2.1. For total FoxO1 and pFoxO1 blots, the same lysate was run on two different gels at the same time in the same gel rig. The gels were then transferred to the same membrane. After staining of the membrane with Ponceau, the membranes were cut and destained. The cut membranes were then probed for the relevant protein. pFoxO1 and total FoxO1 blots had their own GAPDH loading control that was run on the same gel. All uncropped blots are provided in Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09923-x#MOESM1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;. All primary antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology and have been validated by the manufacturer for the indicated applications and species. Specifically, the following antibodies are validated for immunoblotting in mouse and rat samples according to the manufacturer’s website: GAPDH (14C10) rabbit monoclonal antibody (no. 21185) validated for western blot, mouse, rat and human. Phospho-FoxO1 (Thr24/FoxO3a (Thr32) antibody (no. 94645) validated for western blot, mouse, rat and human. Phospho-FoxO1 (Ser256) antibody (no. 9461) validated for western blot, mouse, rat and human. FoxO1 (C29H4) rabbit monoclonal antibody (no. 28805) validated for western blot, mouse, rat and human. Anti-rabbit IgG, HRP-linked antibody (no. 70745) validated for use as a secondary antibody in western blot applications. All antibodies were used at the dilutions recommended by the manufacturer and produced bands at the expected molecular weights in our samples, consistent with the manufacturer’s validation data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec36"&gt;Serum analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sera harvested by cardiac puncture were analysed by IDEXX Bioanalytics for total bicarbonate, potassium, anion gap, cytokines, AST, ALT, BUN, albumin and creatinine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec37"&gt;RNA-seq and data processing&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total RNA was extracted from heart tissue using the Allprep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) per manufacturer protocol. Libraries were generated using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded messenger RNA Sample Prep Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina). Then 75-base pair single-end sequencing was preformed using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Read quality was assessed using FastQC, version 0.11.5 (Babraham Bioinformatics). Reads were mapped to the mm10 genome using STAR v.2.5.3a (ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 44" title="Dobin, A. et al.

For survival, log-rank analysis was used. D’Agostino and Shapiro–Wilk normality tests were performed on data sets to determine the distribution of the data sets. For pairwise comparisons, unpaired &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test, Mann–Whitney test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Kruskal–Wallis test with Tukey or Dunn’s test, or two-way ANOVA with Tukey or Sidak’s multiple comparison were performed. Statistical tests used are noted in the figure legends. In accordance with our IACUC guidelines, in an effort to reduce the number of animals used for our experiments, where possible and appropriate, experiments were done in parallel and shared controls were used. This is indicated in the figure legends where relevant. For some experiments, data are shown in several panels to simplify viewing of different comparisons within the data sets. This is indicated in the figure legends where relevant. Power analyses showed the appropriate sample sizes to use for 80% power to detect an estimated detectable effect size, assuming a 5% significance level and a two-sided test. Allocation was random within sex-matched and age-matched cohorts. For data exclusions, see Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09923-x#Fig1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; for the troponin I measurements. We had to estimate the appropriate amount to dilute samples for the ELISA. Four uninfected young serum samples and one young surviving infected serum sample were diluted below the limit of detection. We did not have enough serum for these samples to rerun at a greater concentration, so we omitted these samples from the analysis. In Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09923-x#Fig8"&gt;4b–f,h–j&lt;/a&gt;, a pathologist flagged one young surviving and three young dying slides as having artefacts present that can compromise interpretations and one young surviving and two young dying slides as having severe artefacts present and slides of poor quality, therefore, these were omitted from data plots. In Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09923-x#Fig11"&gt;7h&lt;/a&gt; a pathologist flagged one lung from a vehicle surviving mouse as a possible artefact. This sample was omitted.

We still had sufficient sample sizes even with these samples omitted. Experiments were performed with biologically independent animals for each condition and experiments were repeated independently as indicated in the figure legends. Allocation was random within sex-matched and age-matched cohorts. Within each genotype, mice of the same sex and age were randomly assigned to experimental groups. Littermates were used whenever possible. Independent experimental replicates included mice from different litters and cages and were performed on different days, allowing potential litter, cage or day effects to be identified. Potential confounding factors were controlled through experimental design and replication. Blinding was not possible for animal infection experiments because disease outcomes (for example, survival and visible morbidity) were readily apparent to investigators. For quantitative assays including ELISAs, qPCR, western blots, blood chemistry, histopathology, tissue weights, the individuals performing the assays and/or analyses were blinded to group allocation.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmke8rdm100183b798z4ubodq@published"&gt;I’m a gay man in my late 50s, and I’ve dealt with erectile dysfunction for years. I am versatile, but I’ve been bottom more than top, especially over the last few years due to the ED. I’m on multiple medications (ADHD, blood pressure, antidepressant) that can impact erections, and have tried different medications to reduce this problem with little success. My testosterone levels are fine on supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="137" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmke8rdns00193b79rznucsim@published"&gt;I’ve taken Viagra and Cialis for years with diminishing effectiveness, so I saw a urologist, and he proposed an inflatable penile prosthesis. This was a shock to me because I did not think I would qualify or that my insurance would cover it, but he assured me that it did. Insurance initially rejected it, but I did try a vacuum pump and injections in the interim, both of which work, but neither is conducive to spontaneous sex. I can still get an erection 90 percent of the time by myself, and a fair amount of time with a partner; however, most of the erections are not strong enough for anal, or if they are, they soften up after a few minutes, and it ends up not being something that will take me all the way to climax.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmke8rdpg001a3b7926rybgw7@published"&gt;I’m currently scheduled for surgery in a couple of months, but I keep wondering if I am rushing things and should wait until it is the only alternative. I also don’t want to spend the next 10 years sticking myself in the dick with a needle every time I want to have sex, when I could be having awesome “on demand” sex. It is an irreversible procedure, so I’m, of course, having natural hesitancy, but I also feel like I’m going to do it unless you wise people tell me that it would be a big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmke8rdum001d3b79k2gf429t@published"&gt;At this point, it’s reasonable to consider an implant. You have tried many options and haven’t yet been satisfied with any. There’s probably some room for you to experiment (a cock ring in combination with medications/injections could help, for example), but not very much. Regarding your mindset, I generally caution against prioritizing spontaneous sex because it upholds an unrealistic ideal in the face of actual, practical help. But look, you’ve found a solution for someone who, in fact, prioritizes spontaneous sex while experiencing erectile dysfunction. In that respect, you seem to be a prime candidate for the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="196" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmke8rdwa001e3b79u7iprj3i@published"&gt;A few years ago, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/05/girlfriends-fetish-offensive-advice.html"&gt;I interviewed a doctor&lt;/a&gt; who frequently performs implant surgeries (to the tune of 80 a year, at least at the time of the interview in 2021). You should read that column. One of the facts I’d like to highlight from it is just how irreversible the procedure is. “You can’t say, ‘I’ll try a prosthesis, if I don’t like it, in two years from now, I’ll just try some Viagra,’” Dr. Arthur Burnett told me. “Your penis structure will have changed, so medications or other, more minimal options are likely to be unsuccessful.” He also said that the surgery comes with the risk of infection (like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12229807/"&gt;virtually all surgeries&lt;/a&gt;), but in this case, it happens in around &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/ijoru/fulltext/2024/02020/penile_implant_infection__risk_factors,.2.aspx"&gt;one of every 100 implants&lt;/a&gt;. Burnett described implants as “something that can restore a man’s sense of wholeness, not to mention his function,” which is to say that the psychological benefits are very clear. As someone who is pro-medicine and trusting of doctors, I think you’ve been put on a good path. Definitely be sure that this is exactly what you want before you go through with the procedure, but I am all for it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="136" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmke8u0cb002q3b7957t8ip38@published"&gt;It always helps to go in with a semblance of a plan. If you can verbalize to them what you’d like to do ahead of time, go for it. Also include hard nos and plans for contraception and precautions against STIs. If you absolutely don’t want any form of double penetration, state that clearly before you get started, and they won’t be surprised. (If they attempt to do so anyway, you have every right to shut it down then and there—and you’ll know you’re with inconsiderate partners who don’t deserve a second round.) It’d also be useful to ask the guys (preferably together, but individually could work, too) what they would like to happen during this encounter. Will they want to play together? Are there preferred positions? Do they favor oral over penis-in-vagina or vice versa?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmke8u0cc002r3b792x0zsk40@published"&gt;Once you have a good sense of boundaries and preferences, approach what is on the table with abandon. This is supposed to be fun. Connection means different things to different people, and in a casual situation like this, it can seem appealing or off-putting, depending on taste. But if connection is something that you’re looking for, know that it’s possible to achieve even in a group setting (via things as simple as eye contact or encouraging language).&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmke8u0cc002s3b79wah7dgss@published"&gt;If you want things to go smoothly, and especially if you want a repeat of this group, stay mindful and attempt to give the guys equal attention. It’s not always easy or even possible (sometimes you may find yourself gravitating to one dick over the other or just realize that you vibe with one of the guys more once you’re all naked), but it’s worth striving for. Going in with a good attitude and resolve to ensure that everyone comes out feeling great will set you up for success.&lt;/p&gt;

We have been together since we were 18 and got married at 23. In most aspects, our lives are great. We have two wonderful teenagers and stable jobs, we’re upper middle class, and are surrounded by many family and friends. Our sex lives are lacking.&lt;/p&gt;

We seem to have great, but vanilla sex on vacation. Years ago, we experimented with tantric massages. When we’re at home, we don’t have sex, which I attribute mostly to the daily stresses of life and busy schedules. But I also want more. I want to be able to explore together, learning new things about sex and pushing our boundaries. I have tried to engage a little bit about our fantasies, but that hasn’t really gone anywhere. We’ve bought toys, but usually those are used once and then stored away. I know I watch porn and masturbate too much, and this has jaded my expectations of what sex is supposed to be. But I know we can do better. How do we get out of this rut, reignite our sex lives, and explore together?&lt;/p&gt;

One of her suggestions that leaps out as a potential helper here is to get a hotel room with some regularity, specifically for sex sessions. Try this. You have the funds, and you’ve seen that your sex life thrives outside of your typical environment. Of course, getting a hotel room nearby where you live isn’t quite the same thing as going on vacation, but perhaps the change of scenery will be all you need to mutually turn on. If you find yourself still saddled by the stressors of life despite the venue change, consider working on relaxing—introducing meditation, a fitness regimen, or even some spa time might do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="119" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmke8u0cf002z3b791yu7l6oz@published"&gt;The theme of this guidance is &lt;em&gt;effort&lt;/em&gt;. You can’t sit around expecting your sex life to magically improve. Why are you treating sex toys like single-use plastics? Bring them out again! What does it mean that you “tried to engage a little bit about our fantasies, but that hasn’t really gone anywhere?” Don’t let that conversation fall to the wayside so easily. Don’t be annoying or badger your wife, but be persistent enough to gain an understanding of where her mind is regarding the topic of your sex life and fantasies that could yet be realized. You’ll need her participation and effort, too, so if she’s not willing to do that, you can at least probe as to why.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Over the past several decades, a hopeful story has played out across southern Uganda.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The number of children who've lost a parent has plummeted, from nearly one in four in the early 2000s to just 6% in 2022.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;New research suggests the decline in orphanhood – defined as the loss of at least one parent – was driven by HIV foreign aid programs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm about 70 now," says study co-author Dr. David Serwadda of Makerere University in Uganda. "I've never seen a program intervention that has had this huge impact."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Serwadda was working in Uganda during the mid-1990s, when the HIV pandemic was claiming more than 100,000 lives each year.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I remember visiting what looked like an abandoned household, we just kept shouting 'is anybody home,' " he says. Three children came out, aged 9, 7 and 6. "We asked, 'Where are the parents?' The parents were gone."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Back then, a child whose mother had HIV was about 20 times more likely to become orphaned than a child with an HIV-negative mom. Kids orphaned by AIDS suffer many consequences, says Aleya Khalifa, an epidemiologist at Columbia University and study co-author. They're more likely to face stigma, drop out of school or live in poverty, she says. "You start to see a cycle of vulnerability."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;U.S.-funded aid programs, primarily the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(25)00440-1/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;broke that cycle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for many kids, according to Khalifa and Serwadda's study published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet Global Health&lt;/em&gt;. Now, children living with HIV-positive moms are just twice as likely to be orphaned, down from 20 times more likely.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The findings are just so clear," says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.stonybrookmedicine.edu/faculty/RachelKidman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rachel Kidman&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a social epidemiologist at Stony Brook University who wasn't involved in the research. While she says the study can't draw a definitive causal link, "this decline in orphanhood due to HIV is absolutely because adults have access to life-saving antiretroviral drugs."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The results also underline what's now at risk because of the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/01/25/g-s1-44762/pepfar-trump-hiv-foreign-aid" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Trump administration's cuts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to foreign aid and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/07/26/g-s1-79083/pepfar-hiv-aids-rescission" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;uncertainty around the future&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of HIV funding, says Kidman.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Domestic governments and charitable foundations only have so many resources to sort of plug those holes, and I'm not seeing other high income countries stepping up," says Kidman. "I think the consequences for children are going to be very dire."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracking orphanhood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To understand how HIV treatments affected orphanhood, Khalifa and her colleagues turned to a &lt;a href="https://www.rhsp.org/rccs-study-1" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;long-running study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Rakai District, a rural region of southern Uganda that abuts Lake Victoria. Since 1995, researchers there have been gathering data about births, deaths and HIV status among households. All told, the team followed over 90,000 kids, tracking the number of new orphans up to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Before 2004, these HIV treatments weren't available, and orphanhood in the area was very high. Afterwards, these drugs started to trickle out to communities, but only to the very sick. In 2014, the World Health Organization expanded eligibility to everyone living with HIV.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That steep, steep drop was actually quite impressive to see after ART became universally available from 2014," says Khalifa.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Of course, parents can die from causes other than HIV. But roughly 70% of new orphans had HIV-positive parents before 2004. That dropped to about 11% after 2015.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This outstanding paper is testament to the incredible impacts of PEPFAR, the Global Fund and the global HIV response," says &lt;a href="https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/people/professor-lucie-cluver" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lucie Cluver&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a social scientist at the University of Oxford who wasn't involved in the study. Over the past two decades, PEPFAR invested &lt;a href="https://ug.usembassy.gov/the-u-s-presidents-emergency-plan-for-aids-relief-pepfar/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;$3 billion dollars&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Uganda — and over $100 billion around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the future of PEPFAR is in doubt after the Trump administration's dismantling of foreign aid.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Protecting PEPFAR now will protect millions of children from orphanhood," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The future of PEPFAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration's abrupt and drastic cuts to foreign aid last year, disrupted many HIV treatment programs across Africa, including in Uganda.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"The speed at which this came down completely took us off guard," says Serwadda. Health care workers in these programs could no longer deliver drugs because they weren't getting paid, he says. "The drugs were in stock, but people were not available."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That meant many went without treatment, he says. Eventually, many programs resumed, he says, albeit with tighter budgets. Some programs completely shut down, he says. He and other researchers are assessing the fallout.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'll be very surprised if we don't see the impact, mainly through patients losing their treatment," he says – leading to a rebound of HIV that can increase transmission and death.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a statement, the State Department told NPR that "PEPFAR continues to provide life-saving HIV testing, care, and treatment services for anyone living with HIV, and anyone already receiving treatment through PEPFAR can remain on treatment."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The statement added: "The most effective way to prevent HIV-related orphanhood is to keep parents alive. The new global health [agreements] do just that by prioritizing lifesaving HIV medicines – including antiretroviral therapies like Lenacapavir – and the frontline workers who deliver them."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. is currently negotiating health agreements with individual countries that transition responsibility for HIV program funding to national governments. In December, it signed an agreement with Uganda to invest up to &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/12/strengthening-health-ties-with-uganda-and-lesotho-under-the-america-first-global-health-strategy" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;$1.7 billion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over the next five years to combat infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In terms of sheer dollars, it's about a 25-30% reduction compared to PEPFAR funding, says Serwadda. Major questions remain about how the transition could go, but he holds out hope.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If, and this is a big if, this is actually implemented according to the memorandum, it will be very good for Uganda," he says, since country-level ownership of the program would make it more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But he's worried. "Our valley of death is in the transition," he says. "There's so many things that can go wrong. It may not go at the speed it should be, or with the attention, the resources that we will need and the political support and leadership that it will require. Many dots need to be well aligned for us to do this."&lt;/p&gt;

These symptoms are among the most common reasons patients abandon the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New research from Columbia University suggests a possible explanation for why this happens in some individuals. The study indicates that certain statins can attach to a protein inside muscle cells, triggering a leak of calcium ions that disrupts normal muscle function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is unlikely that this explanation applies to everyone who experiences muscular side effects with statins, but even if it explains a small subset, that's a lot of people we could help if we can resolve the issue," says Andrew Marks, chair of the Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics at the Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statins are widely used in the United States. Roughly 40 million adults take them to control cholesterol levels, and about 10 percent develop muscle related side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I've had patients who've been prescribed statins, and they refused to take them because of the side effects. It's the most common reason patients quit statins, and it's a very real problem that needs a solution," Marks says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Longstanding Puzzle Around Statin Muscle Pain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have been trying to understand statin related muscle problems since the drugs first became available in the late 1980s. Statins work by binding to an enzyme involved in cholesterol production, but they can also attach to other unintended targets in the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier research hinted that muscle side effects might occur when statins interact with a specific protein in muscle tissue. Until now, the details of that interaction were unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using cryo-electron microscopy, a powerful imaging method that allows researchers to see structures down to individual atoms, the Columbia team was able to directly observe how a statin interacts with muscle cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calcium Leaks Inside Muscle Cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The images showed that a commonly prescribed statin, simvastatin, binds to two specific sites on a muscle protein known as the ryanodine receptor. This binding opens a channel in the protein, allowing calcium to leak into areas of the cell where it does not normally flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Marks, this calcium leak may explain muscle pain and weakness linked to statins. The excess calcium can weaken muscle fibers directly or activate enzymes that gradually break down muscle tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toward Safer Cholesterol Drugs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings point to new possibilities for reducing statin side effects. One approach would be to redesign statins so they continue to lower cholesterol but no longer bind to the ryanodine receptor in muscle cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marks is currently working with chemists to develop statins that avoid this unwanted interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another potential strategy focuses on stopping the calcium leak itself. The researchers showed that in mice, statin related calcium leaks can be closed using an experimental drug created in the Marks laboratory for other disorders involving abnormal calcium flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These drugs are currently being tested in people with rare muscle diseases. If it shows efficacy in those patients, we can test it in statin-induced myopathies," Marks says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Details and Disclosures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Marks is also the Clyde and Helen Wu Professor of Medicine at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, a professor of biomedical engineering, and director of the Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published Dec. 15 in "Structural basis for simvastatin-induced skeletal muscle weakness associated with RyR1 T4709M mutation," in the Journal of Clinical Investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

They did so at equal rates irrespective of whether they were implanted into the lymph node or skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stolen batteries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mitochondrial theft seemed to have at least two effects that benefited cancer cells. Not only did it weaken the immune cells from which these powerful organelles were stolen, but it also triggered a beneficial molecular pathway in the cancer cells that gained them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cancer cells that took up the mitochondria began expressing genes linked to the type I interferon pathway, an immune signalling cascade that might help cells evade the immune system and support lymph-node invasion. Silencing genes associated with this pathway reduced the ability of cancer cells to migrate to lymph nodes in mice, Okwan-Duodu and his colleagues found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings represent “an entirely new mechanism by which mitochondrial transfer helps cancer progress”, says Cynthia Reinhart-King, a bioengineer at Rice University in Houston, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits to cancer cells held up even when the researchers destroyed the stolen mitochondria’s ability to produce the energy-carrying molecule ATP, showing that the organelles’ energy production is not crucial to these effects, Okwan-Duodu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

By bringing together data from multiple long-running studies, scientists were able to examine how memory performance shifts alongside structural changes in the brain over time.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis drew on more than 10,000 MRI scans and over 13,000 memory assessments from 3,700 cognitively healthy adults across 13 separate studies. The results -- which tracked people across a wide age range -- reveal that the link between brain shrinkage and memory decline is not simple or linear. The association grows stronger in later life and cannot be explained only by well-known genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, including APOE ε4. Together, the findings suggest that brain aging involves complex, widespread changes rather than damage driven by a single cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Decline Reflects Widespread Brain Changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, the study titled "Vulnerability to memory decline in aging revealed by a mega-analysis of structural brain change" shows that memory-related brain changes extend far beyond one isolated region. Although the hippocampus showed the strongest connection between volume loss and declining memory, many other areas of the brain were also involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both cortical and subcortical regions demonstrated meaningful relationships between structural decline and memory performance. Rather than pointing to failure in a single brain structure, the findings indicate a distributed vulnerability across the brain. Researchers observed a gradual pattern across regions, with the hippocampus showing the largest effects and smaller but still significant associations appearing across much of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Nonlinear Pattern With Accelerating Effects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that the relationship between brain atrophy and memory loss varied widely between individuals and followed a nonlinear pattern. People who experienced faster-than-average structural brain loss showed much steeper declines in memory. This suggests that once brain shrinkage passes a certain level, its impact on memory increases more rapidly instead of progressing at a steady pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This accelerating effect appeared across many brain regions, not just the hippocampus. The consistency of this pattern supports the idea that memory decline during healthy aging reflects large-scale and network-level structural changes. While the hippocampus remains especially sensitive, it functions as part of a broader system rather than acting alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the Findings Mean for Understanding Aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By integrating data across dozens of research cohorts, we now have the most detailed picture yet of how structural changes in the brain unfold with age and how they relate to memory," said Alvaro Pascual-Leone, MD, PhD, senior scientist at the Hinda and Arthur Marcus Institute for Aging Research and medical director at the Deanna and Sidney Wolk Center for Memory Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Cognitive decline and memory loss are not simply the consequence of aging, but manifestations of individual predispositions and age-related processes enabling neurodegenerative processes and diseases. These results suggest that memory decline in aging is not just about one region or one gene -- it reflects a broad biological vulnerability in brain structure that accumulates over decades. Understanding this can help researchers identify individuals at risk early, and develop more precise and personalized interventions that support cognitive health across the lifespan and prevent cognitive disability."&lt;/p&gt;

It had become her home base — the place she kept returning to between travels — and she was finally easing into a routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her days were slow and intentional. She’d start her mornings with yoga and a nourishing breakfast before riding her motorcycle to the beach, where she’d walk along the shore and lie in the sun. Later, she’d head home to edit videos or work with clients, squeeze in a gym session, then return to the beach once more for sunset — a daily ritual she rarely missed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was perfect,” she tells PEOPLE exclusively. “I was finally building a routine and a sense of stability that felt really good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vivian Nosovitsky&lt;/p&gt; Vivian Nosovitsky snaps a selfie&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was also building something else: community. Nosovitsky had grown close to the people around town and always looked forward to seeing familiar faces. Free-spirited and open to new opportunities, she was just about to launch a new coaching offer when everything changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One morning around 2 a.m., Nosovitsky woke up with intense pain in her eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was watering, swollen and extremely uncomfortable,” she recalls. “I thought it might go away if I slept it off — but I never fell back asleep. The pain just kept getting worse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Light sensitivity quickly became unbearable. She put on sunglasses immediately, unable to tolerate even minimal brightness. After a few days with no improvement — and no relief from the drops prescribed at a small urgent care clinic — she knew something was seriously wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She traveled 40 minutes to a larger hospital, where doctors told her she had an ulcer in her eye and prescribed additional medication. But her condition rapidly worsened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My eye was turning gray,” she says. “I knew something was extremely off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vivian Nosovitsky&lt;/p&gt; Vivian Nosovitsky's eye&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she returned the next day, doctors urged her to seek urgent, intensive care in another city three hours away. Unwilling to go through it alone, Nosovitsky instead flew to Querétaro to stay with a friend, who helped care for her and took her to a specialized eye hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There, doctors performed a corneal scraping. Days later, lab results confirmed the diagnosis: &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21560-acanthamoeba-keratitis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:acanthamoeba keratitis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;acanthamoeba keratitis&lt;/a&gt;, a rare and aggressive eye infection caused by a parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I honestly didn’t even know what that meant at first,” Nosovitsky says. “I had never heard of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She soon learned the parasite likely entered her eye through tap water and an opening caused by contact lens use, and that it was, quite literally, eating away at her cornea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pain was excruciating. Light became intolerable. She was forced to stay in complete darkness, stripped of everything she loved: movement, the beach, working out and running her online business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve had very low energy,” she says. “Physically, mentally, it’s affected every part of me. There were days I didn’t want to do anything but lie there and wish it would be over.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment required medicated eye drops every single hour, around the clock. Even at night, she had to wake herself to administer them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I haven’t slept properly in weeks,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vivian Nosovitsky&lt;/p&gt; Vivian Nosovitsky at the doctor&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience pushed her to some of the lowest points she’d ever known. Even hospital appointments were overwhelming, with bright lights leaving her drained and overstimulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I realized I couldn’t see out of my right eye, that was terrifying,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout it all, Nosovitsky chose to share her journey online. Vulnerability, she says, has always mattered to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re so drowned in fake content and filtered lives,” she says. “I wanted to be real.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She posted on TikTok — the platform where her social media career first took off — and felt a strong intuition that the videos would resonate. They did. Her story quickly went viral, amassing millions of views and drawing an outpouring of support to her &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-me-save-my-eye-from-this-eye-eating-parasite?attribution_id=sl:0b5d4f73-28bf-4459-8c18-2378d34f4bc5&amp;amp;lang=en_US&amp;amp;ts=1767657984&amp;amp;utm_campaign=man_today_first_time_share&amp;amp;utm_content=amp17_control&amp;amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;amp;utm_source=sms" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoFundMe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People also flooded her comments and DMs with prayers, encouragement and stories of their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t expect this level of kindness,” she says. “People just want to connect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, she says, even as she lost her vision, she gained visibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even though I can’t see, I’m being seen more than ever,” she says. “It stripped away all the masks and brought me back to myself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Nosovitsky holds onto hope, both for healing and awareness. She believes mindset and surrender will carry her through whatever comes next, whether that means avoiding surgery or accepting a longer road to recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above all, she hopes people take away a renewed sense of gratitude and a warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You don’t realize how much you should’ve appreciated something until it’s gone,” she says, urging others to take eye health and contact lens hygiene seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And she credits one thing above all else for getting her through the darkest moments: community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wouldn’t have survived this without it,” she says. “The women who cared for me in Mexico, the people cooking for me, supporting me — and even the online community praying and visualizing my healing. The power of community is stronger than anything.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/21-year-old-woman-learns-eye-pain-is-actually-a-parasite-eating-her-cornea-exclusive-11882329" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 14:10:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE9tT1BQVUhKTC0xNlNjZGtwX0lsUzlWLV9fRVVxWHZDS2w4S3JYemFHanNsbXhxeE9KbURIYnlhSGpoYUJMUl9RanJJWU5kVDA4Y3VYQWwwd2wydngtTmlneU1FbDFVT0hLRndBelZRTmVick9YdU4xaGxEYw</guid></item><item><title>随着另一个国家开始进行前列腺癌筛查， NHS面临压力-《每日电讯报》</title><link>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2026/01/14/nhs-yet-another-country-begins-prostate-cancer-screening/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;p&gt;The announcement in Croatia was made by Marija Bubaš, a health minister, and Krunoslav Capak, director of the Croatian Institute of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Capak said: “In the two-year pilot project for prostate cancer, we achieved the goals and defined the weak points, and we know what needs to be prepared for a successful national programme – from administration, through diagnostics and the division of roles in each step of screening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Velimir Korak, president of the Croatian Society of Prostate Cancer Patients, said: “We are very pleased to welcome the launch of the national screening programme next year because early detection enables more effective treatment and significantly improves the quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: “The Secretary of State has been clear he wants to see screening in place for the most common cancer in men, provided this is backed by evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He is examining the evidence and arguments in the draft recommendation thoroughly, bringing together those with differing views, ahead of the final recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the meantime, we will keep making progress on cutting cancer waiting times and investing in research into prostate cancer detection – in the last 12 months, 195,000 more patients received a diagnosis for suspected cancer on time. We are also providing funding to the £42 million TRANSFORM trial, which has the potential to revolutionise prostate cancer screening, cutting out harmful side effects and making screening far more accurate.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;More than 9 out of 10 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's cases&lt;/a&gt; could be driven by specific variations in a single gene and the protein it produces, a new study reveals, suggesting that treatments targeting this well-known gene could prevent the disease from developing in the majority of instances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gene in question, &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt;, has &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-rare-gene-variant-seems-to-protect-you-from-alzheimers-disease"&gt;long been associated&lt;/a&gt; with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="188646" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; risk. What's new here is the way the different variations of the gene have been analysed and mapped against the chances of developing Alzheimer's. It turns out that the &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; combination we're born with could be even more important than previously realized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers led by a team from University College London (UCL) took a fresh look at the three main variations of the &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; gene: ε2 (linked to a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-201205"&gt;protective effect&lt;/a&gt; against cognitive decline), ε3 (historically considered the normal or neutral version), and ε4 (already known to significantly increase Alzheimer's risk).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/junk-dna-could-hide-switches-that-allow-alzheimers-to-take-hold"&gt;'Junk' DNA Could Hide Switches That Allow Alzheimer's to Take Hold&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found, based on four genetic datasets covering almost 470,000 people, that ε3 isn't actually neutral – it can be considered a major &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-1-risk-factor-for-alzheimers-disease-may-not-be-what-you-think"&gt;risk factor&lt;/a&gt;. Part of the reason this hasn't been flagged before is that it's the most common variant of &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt;, found in around three-quarters of the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we consider the contributions of ε3 and ε4, we can see that &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; potentially has a role in almost all Alzheimer's disease," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2026/jan/most-alzheimers-cases-linked-variants-single-gene"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; genetic epidemiologist Dylan Williams, from UCL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ε4 variant of &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; is well recognised as harmful by dementia researchers, but much disease would not occur without the additional impact of the common ε3 allele, which has been typically misperceived as neutral in terms of Alzheimer's risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188649" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188649" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/AlzheimersChart.jpg" alt="Alzheimer's chart" class="wp-image-188649 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/AlzheimersChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/AlzheimersChart-569x675.jpg 569w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/AlzheimersChart-600x711.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-188649" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Population estimates of the proportion of Alzheimer's disease attributable to different risk-associated genes suggested certain &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; variations (far left, ε3 &amp;amp; ε4) are linked to most cases. (Williams et al., &lt;em&gt;NPJ Dement.&lt;/em&gt;, 2026)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone inherits two copies of the &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; gene, one from each parent, meaning six combinations are possible: ε2 / ε2 is the most protective against Alzheimer's, while ε4 / ε4 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-gene-doesnt-guarantee-dementia-heres-what-you-can-do-to-reduce-risk"&gt;raises the risk of the disease&lt;/a&gt; the most. The majority of people are somewhere in between, depending on the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;combination they inherit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, this &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; combination alters the structure and function of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E"&gt;protein produced&lt;/a&gt;. Those proteins then influence certain brain activities already linked to Alzheimer's, including neuron repair, inflammation control, and the clearing away of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-treatment-clears-plaques-from-brains-of-mice-within-hours"&gt;amyloid-beta protein plaques&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that targeting this gene or its protein products may be a way to stop Alzheimer's from happening in the first place – and bring more people down to the risk level associated with ε2 / ε2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Intervening on the &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; gene specifically, or the molecular pathway between the gene and the disease, could have great, and probably under-appreciated, potential for preventing or treating a large majority of Alzheimer's disease," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2026/jan/most-alzheimers-cases-linked-variants-single-gene"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Williams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The extent to which &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; has been researched in relation to Alzheimer's or as a drug target has clearly not been proportionate to its full importance."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There could be implications for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/almost-half-of-dementia-cases-avoidable-by-addressing-14-risk-factors-major-study-finds"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; more broadly, too: Almost half of all dementia cases could be attributed to this &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; gene, the data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188824" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188824" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/DementiaUmbrellaTerm-642x361.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-188824 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/DementiaUmbrellaTerm-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/DementiaUmbrellaTerm-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/DementiaUmbrellaTerm-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/DementiaUmbrellaTerm-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/DementiaUmbrellaTerm-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/DementiaUmbrellaTerm.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-188824" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE — Flu season is gaining momentum across the country, including in King County, where health officials say the warning signs are impossible to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early December, King County Public Health reported approximately 300 emergency department visits per week for flu-like illnesses. By early January, that number had climbed to more than 560.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing emergency department visits for flu. We’re seeing hospitalizations for flu. And we’ve had 10 deaths so far in King County due to flu, all in adults,” said Dr. Sandra Valenciano, health officer and interim director of King County Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates remain a concern. Just over 31% of King County residents have received a flu shot so far this season, slightly lower than at this point last year and part of a longer-term downward trend in flu vaccination, Valenciano said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mutated strain of influenza A, H3N2 subclade K, is surging worldwide. This highly contagious strain spreads easily and changes rapidly. Historically, H3N2-dominated seasons have led to higher hospitalization rates, especially among young children, older adults, and people with underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the circulating strain has drifted slightly from the one targeted by this year’s vaccine, doctors emphasize the flu shot remains one of the most effective tools for preventing severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It still does what it’s supposed to do — keep you out of the hospital,” said Dr. Vin Gupta, a public health physician. “It’s not perfect, but it reduces the risk of hospitalization by 40 to 50%, especially for people who are medically higher risk.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children are a particular focus this season, especially as vaccination rates continue to lag. According to&lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/34114/CDC-9-children-have-died-of-flu-this-season?autologincheck=redirected"&gt; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&lt;/a&gt;, nine children have already died from the flu nationwide this season.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year was one of the deadliest on record for pediatric patients nationwide. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a2.htm"&gt;CDC reports&lt;/a&gt; that 289 children died from the flu, which is the highest number since tracking began in 2004. Nearly nine in 10 of those children were not fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King County Public Health data shows that flu shots are highest among infants, with about 43% vaccinated so far. However, rates drop for older kids, with 32% of 5- to 11-year-olds and 27% of teens vaccinated. Vaccination rates have declined each season since 2022–2023, leaving many children more at risk. Parents should also keep in mind that kids between 6 months to 8 years old may need two doses, four weeks apart, to be fully protected, especially if it is their first time or their vaccination history is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Flu is a risk every year,” Valenciano said. “Every year, people are hospitalized. Every year, people die. Many of those outcomes are preventable. Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself and your family.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flu season often peaks later in the winter and can stretch into March. Since it takes about two weeks for the body to build immunity after vaccination, health officials urge people to get their shot as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They recommend staying home if you feel sick, getting tested if symptoms like fever, body aches, or a cough develop, and considering wearing a mask in crowded indoor spaces. These precautions are especially important for people at higher risk, including children under 2, adults 65 and older, pregnant people, and those with conditions such as heart disease or chronic lung disease.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors also note that antiviral medications like Tamiflu can lessen the severity and shorten the length of illness when taken within the first 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who still need a flu shot, free vaccination options are available across King County. You can find a location &lt;a href="http://If%20you%20still%20need%20a%20flu%20shot,%20free%20vaccination%20options%20are%20available%20across%20King%20County.%20You%20can%20find%20a%20location%20here."&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

"Poor-quality or scented toilet paper may be made from recycled materials containing &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/mumbai-surgeon-reveals-if-eggs-cause-cancer-after-alarming-video-accuses-eggoz-of-using-banned-chemicals-101765339556859.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="chemicals"&gt;chemicals&lt;/a&gt; such as bleaching agents, which can irritate the urethral opening. This irritation makes it easier for bacteria like E. coli to enter the urinary tract."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;He adds that texture also matters. “Coarse, thin, or shredding toilet paper can leave tiny pieces behind. These residues can trap bacteria and moisture, increasing the risk of infection. For people with sensitive skin, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/diabetes" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="diabetes"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, hormonal changes from menopause, or weakened immunity, this risk is even higher.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artContent"&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;Techniques of wiping also play a role. "Ineffective wiping or friction from strong toilet paper can cause micro-abrasions. Colored or scented papers can disturb vaginal pH, further predisposing to UTIs," Dr Shetty warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to reduce risk of UTIs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what can consumers do? "Choosing soft, unscented, dye-free toilet paper made from virgin pulp or high-quality bamboo can help protect the skin and reduce residue. Practising front-to-back wiping, avoiding excessive pressure, and staying hydrated remain essential," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;Dr Shetty emphasises that frequent &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/doctor-reveals-the-deadly-risk-of-untreated-utis-you-could-lose-a-limb-101757763380389.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="UTIs"&gt;UTIs&lt;/a&gt; may require a closer look at everyday personal hygiene items.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Taking certain supplements may also help strengthen your immunity. To find out whether vitamin D supplements can help in this department, we spoke with &lt;a href="https://providers.clevelandclinic.org/provider/matthew-badgett/4269950" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Matthew Badgett, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a primary care provider at Cleveland Clinic.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;em&gt;*This interview has been edited and condensed for length and clarity. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Q: How does vitamin D affect the immune system? Does it have a supportive role?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Badgett:&lt;/strong&gt; Vitamin D is an immunomodulator hormone, meaning it helps activate immune cells. Immune cells can also convert vitamin D into its active form, enhancing the immune response. At the same time, vitamin D helps suppress excessive immune reactions, protecting against autoimmunity and excessive inflammation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, it also appears to help balance the immune system in ways that aid in fighting infections. People with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/new-guidelines-supplemental-vitamin-d-8666125" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;higher vitamin D levels&lt;/a&gt; tend to fare better against infections, although this may be more correlational than causal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research is mixed—some studies show a benefit, while others show no benefit for taking vitamin D, and some show reduced infection risks. Although the effect is marginal, such as a 10% reduction in infections. The supplement would also need to be taken daily before you get sick, not once you get sick.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are also trials showing a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/autoimmune-diseases-overview-3232654" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduction in autoimmune diseases&lt;/a&gt;, as well as improved outcomes for patients with those autoimmune diseases who take it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-are-there-any-safety-concerns"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Are There Any Safety Concerns? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Watch your supplements and ensure you aren’t taking multiple supplements that contain vitamin D. Excessive vitamin D intake can cause problems. I see &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/too-much-vitamin-d-8401436" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D toxicity&lt;/a&gt; affecting calcium levels quite often since people overdose on it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I recommend &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-vitamins-should-i-take-daily-8774015" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;daily supplements over weekly ones&lt;/a&gt; since they are more consistent, and the mega weekly doses have some trials showing harm in the elderly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Check your levels before taking a supplement or upping your dosage, and note that levels drop in the winter since sunlight is what our body needs to make vitamin D. In theory, with enough sun, we don’t need vitamin D. Some people may take more in the winter and less in the summer to avoid overdosing, but this is a complicated strategy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Trials vary, but typically range from 400 IU to 5,000 IU for several months to achieve higher serum levels. I usually recommend adults start at 1,000 to 2,000 IU.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The bottom line is that it’s difficult to say how vitamin D supplements will affect you or how they stack up to other supplements that support the immune system, such as vitamin C. Much of this depends on your individual body—what your vitamin D levels usually are to begin with—so it might be helpful to speak with a physician to see if &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/when-do-you-need-vitamin-d-supplement-11817682" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D supplements are safe&lt;/a&gt; for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your doctor can also help you decide which kind of vitamin D supplement—and what dosage—you should try. In the meantime, you can get vitamin D from the following food sources&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;:

This is the main conclusion of a data analysis of more than 135,000 people with an average age of 64, published January 14 in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)02219-6/abstract?utm_campaign=tlpr&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8dSqANxz7RYcwxtyqvREh3Ik7GFc7Jz5S9EuQN1397pvhgJWuEdI3Xz9Mqp0oBD6x-hvY0ctDtaZM6Ri1HTqQkdmXo4Q&amp;amp;_hsmi=397714141&amp;amp;utm_content=397714141&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)02219-6/abstract?utm_campaign=tlpr&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8dSqANxz7RYcwxtyqvREh3Ik7GFc7Jz5S9EuQN1397pvhgJWuEdI3Xz9Mqp0oBD6x-hvY0ctDtaZM6Ri1HTqQkdmXo4Q&amp;amp;_hsmi=397714141&amp;amp;utm_content=397714141&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Lancet&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The study, led by Ulf Ekelund of the Norwegian School of Sport Science, estimates that if the least active 20% of people added five minutes of moderate-to-vigorous exercise per day, equivalent to a brisk walk, 6% of premature deaths in this high-risk group could be prevented. If this small increase in daily physical activity were adopted by the entire population (without needing to include the most active 20%), the reduction in premature mortality would reach 10%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The same study points to another easy measure that can improve the health of millions of people: reducing sitting time by 30 minutes a day, with short walks of a couple of minutes every hour, for example, could prevent between 3% and 7% of premature deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The results suggest that the most sedentary people benefit more from increased vigorous exercise. For a very inactive person, increasing daily activity from one to six minutes reduces the risk of mortality by 30%, and for those already exercising for nine minutes daily who add another five, the reduction is 18%. Once 24 minutes of daily activity are reached, the risk reduction is no longer as pronounced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;A second study, published in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(25)00676-5/fulltext?utm_campaign=tlpr&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-967eAFfSixKB1jgCqihbVb8CStBJPSHHY0o5qzGVXqNn1WJxRXaBqfVlfw0PzKrcjSeiYFs5pISIJ3n-v2-0tL3BvekQ&amp;amp;_hsmi=397714141&amp;amp;utm_content=397714141&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(25)00676-5/fulltext?utm_campaign=tlpr&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-967eAFfSixKB1jgCqihbVb8CStBJPSHHY0o5qzGVXqNn1WJxRXaBqfVlfw0PzKrcjSeiYFs5pISIJ3n-v2-0tL3BvekQ&amp;amp;_hsmi=397714141&amp;amp;utm_content=397714141&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;&lt;i&gt;eClinicalMedicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a journal in &lt;i&gt;The Lancet&lt;/i&gt; group, presents results that expand upon the previous study’s findings on how small lifestyle changes can have a significant impact on &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2026-01-06/science-seeks-keys-to-human-longevity-in-the-genetic-mixing-of-brazilian-supercentenarians.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2026-01-06/science-seeks-keys-to-human-longevity-in-the-genetic-mixing-of-brazilian-supercentenarians.html"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt;. The work, led by Emmanuel Stamatakis of the University of Sydney (Australia), used data from 60,000 participants in the UK Biobank to analyze how the combination of sleep, physical activity, and nutrition affects life expectancy and years lived without major illnesses such as cancer, diabetes, or dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The results demonstrate how health is a matter of synergy. While achieving results with a single tool requires significant effort, small, simultaneous changes in these three pillars of health produce far greater benefits. To gain a year of life, it’s only necessary to sleep five more minutes a day, exercise two more minutes, and add half a serving of vegetables to your daily diet. To achieve the same by changing only sleep habits, you would need to sleep 25 more minutes a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The researchers also calculated what it would take to &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2025-02-19/life-expectancy-in-europe-is-no-longer-growing-as-it-used-to.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/health/2025-02-19/life-expectancy-in-europe-is-no-longer-growing-as-it-used-to.html"&gt;extend life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; without serious illness by four years. While the effort required is somewhat greater, it is still achievable for most people. It would involve sleeping 24 minutes more per day, exercising for four minutes more, and adding about 100 grams of vegetables, a daily serving of whole grains, and two servings of fish per week to one’s diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The study also calculated the effects of the optimal combination of these lifestyle habits. For those who sleep between seven and eight hours a day, exercise for more than 42 minutes daily, and maintain a high-quality diet, the gain is almost 10 years of life expectancy in good health compared to those with the worst habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The data indicates that good habits reinforce each other. For example, while exercise is the main driver of added years of life, its effectiveness increases when combined with good sleep and nutrition. To gain eight years of health, a person who only exercises would need 30 minutes a day, but if they combine it with an extra hour of sleep each night and a healthy diet, they would only need 10 minutes of intense exercise to achieve the same result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;One of the interesting contributions of these studies is the use of devices to obtain objective, precise, and continuous measurements of the activity of volunteers. The results of studies evaluating the effects of physical inactivity attribute between 7% and 9% of mortality to it, but these are usually based on information provided by the participants. This method tends to underestimate the true effect of physical activity in reducing premature deaths, something that differs from the analysis published in &lt;i&gt;The Lancet&lt;/i&gt;. In this study, movement was recorded with accelerometers worn by the subjects, eliminating the risk of forgetfulness or of the volunteer responding according to what they would have liked to have done rather than what they actually did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Several independent experts, consulted by the Science Media Center, value the results, although they caution that the study is observational and cannot establish a cause-and-effect relationship between exercise or a healthy diet and reduced mortality. Aiden Doherty, from the University of Oxford, appreciates the results and the recommendations that can be drawn from them, as well as their potential benefits for making healthcare systems — which are stretched to their limits — more sustainable. However, for now, he still encourages “adults to follow the World Health Organization’s physical activity guidelines and aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“In addition, adults need at least two days of muscle-strengthening activity each week,” adds the Oxford professor. While he believes it’s important to strive for the WHO’s targets, Doherty concludes that “the results of this new study demonstrate that every movement counts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sign up for &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en" rel="" title="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en"&gt;&lt;i&gt;our weekly newsletter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>EL PAÍS English</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 13:00:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>当今美国5种最致命的心脏病—及其最大的风险因素- Money Talks新闻</title><link>https://www.moneytalksnews.com/the-most-deadly-heart-conditions-in-america-today-and-their-biggest-warning-signs/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Money Talks News</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 12:45:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxORmd1S2Ftam5tdi0xTDU2UFlVbzVoTGExa2Rha2NiR0pKYlFid0RYZWQ4bTF1dW90dW9GVHB1NHhLUTZXSVkzN1ZNNUpDcmM5R3hBc1cwRlBmb1dtMkZkQUltWUVYVHd2dExGS242QkhOaFREeVM3amFqY3R4TlR1UjN4bkk0Ry1aTThZMDhGWTF3U1Zqaks3ektzX05jb1pzSU9VeldzZ1FYQ21xRk9STHJ2OA</guid></item><item><title>密歇根州流感激增幅度继续超过美国平均水平- MLive.com</title><link>https://www.mlive.com/news/2026/01/michigan-flu-surge-continues-to-outpace-us-average.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2VLPJ2V6I5B33NL5P2DHKCUYZA"&gt;Respiratory illnesses continue to account for more than 10% of outpatient health care visits in Michigan, outpacing the national average. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5SIOOUUGRFC7PEHIMQ2HSSEKYQ"&gt;Influenza-like illness saw a slight decrease from &lt;a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/2026/01/flu-surge-in-michigan-state-reaches-worst-tier-on-cdc-scale.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mlive.com/news/2026/01/flu-surge-in-michigan-state-reaches-worst-tier-on-cdc-scale.html"&gt;11.3%&lt;/a&gt; of outpatient visits to 10% during the week ending Jan. 3.

Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;)—A new study published on Wednesday by Harvard Medical School has found a link between the overuse of Botox and pathological lying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Repeated injections of Botox to the face interact with proteins in the brain,” Professor Harland Dorrinson, who supervised the study, said. “The result is an acute allergic reaction to the truth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though over-injecting Botox makes it difficult for a user to move the facial muscles necessary for speech, he said, “to the extent that the person’s mouth is capable of moving, it will be lying.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study revealed other negative side effects of Botox, such as swelling in the cranium that requires the user to wear an enormous hat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="captioned-image-container"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.borowitzreport.com/p/hide-fido"

It most often happens when the penis slips out during thrusting and forcefully hits a partner’s pelvis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“A penile fracture occurs when the tunica albuginea, the tough fibrous sheath surrounding the erectile tissue, tears,” she explains. “When the penis is erect, that tissue becomes thin and stretched, making it vulnerable to sudden bending or impact — even though there’s no bone inside.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If someone delays seeking care, the torn tissue can heal improperly. “That can lead to permanent curvature, painful erections, or long-term erectile dysfunction,” Ambardjieva said. “This is the one sexual injury where time really matters.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objects That Get ‘Lost’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ambardjieva said foreign objects getting “lost” in the body are a routine part of ER and gynecology work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’ve removed all kinds of items that weren’t designed to go inside the body — cucumbers, carrots, sprays — and I’ve also seen objects in the male urethra, like a pencil,” she said. “People are usually terrified and embarrassed, but it’s more common than they think.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The problem often comes down to&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/best-anal-sex-toys_l_64640ccfe4b056fd46d62ce8" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name=" using objects without a flared base" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69655155e4b0f3f37e7791bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="64640ccfe4b056fd46d62ce8" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt; using objects without a flared base&lt;/a&gt;, smooth shape, or any kind of safety stop.

The vaginal canal is a closed space, so objects can get stuck but won’t travel deeper into the body. “The rectum, however, has no anatomical stop and creates suction, meaning objects can be pulled further inside,” Ambardjieva explains. “The urethra is narrow and delicate, making insertions particularly dangerous.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re embarrassed to come into the hospital because you’ve inserted something that’s become stuck, Ambardjieva hopes you’ll reconsider and not let the stigma keep you from getting care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s important to normalize this. We remove lost objects every week in the emergency and urology practice,” Ambardjieva said. “It’s a common medical issue — not something to be ashamed of.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaginal Tears And Bleeding After Sex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Small vaginal tears are another frequent reason for ER visits, especially among &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sex-over-50-women_l_690f9c2ce4b03cb129003a74" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="postmenopausal women" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69655155e4b0f3f37e7791bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="690f9c2ce4b03cb129003a74" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;postmenopausal women&lt;/a&gt; or anyone dealing with vaginal dryness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Even a small tear can bleed more than people expect, which really scares them,” Ambardjieva said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Friction, &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-best-lubes-for-women-vaginal-dryness_l_5e3aea99c5b6b5fb438b4dd3" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="insufficient lubrication" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69655155e4b0f3f37e7791bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="5e3aea99c5b6b5fb438b4dd3" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;insufficient lubrication&lt;/a&gt;, or a tense pelvic floor can all cause micro-tears.

Ross,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; an assistant professor at the University of Missouri, has seen some extreme cases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several years ago in St. Louis, he said he treated a patient who inserted his pet gerbil into his rectum with lubrication: “He ended up in the ER with rectal bleeding. We were able to get the gerbil out, but unfortunately, the gerbil wasn’t so lucky; he had already suffocated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In December 2024, Ross said he treated two patients on the same Christmas shift whose wives were out of town. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“One had inserted a full-sized LED lightbulb into his rectum. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It required anesthesia and surgical removal,” he said. “Shortly after, another patient arrived with his wife’s vibrator lodged inside. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both myself and the other ER doc on shift tried again, but no luck, we had to call the surgeon back. I remember he remarked it was a pretty fancy one, rechargeable batteries. I can’t imagine how those conversations went when their wives got back in town.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So it’s unsurprising that Ross encourages people to come to the ER if they run into an issue like this (or a less extreme one), but also to be more proactive about safety when it comes to the rear end. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If you’re into inserting things into your rectum, use devices designed for that so they don’t get lost,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both doctors stress that shame is what causes the real harm, wacky hijinks aside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Sexual injuries and accidents are far more common than people realize,” Ambardjieva said. “Emergency clinicians truly aren’t judging.

It was the early 1980s, and a young boy had been brought in with symptoms of a severe infection that was spreading through his body, damaging multiple organs and tissues. But his doctors could find no trace of a pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05889-1" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00082-1/d41586-026-00082-1_16014370.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;The ghost of influenza past and the hunt for a universal vaccine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boy was flown to Levin’s hospital for further tests. To the surprise of Levin and his colleagues, the culprit was a common bacterium: &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium fortuitum&lt;/i&gt;, which lives in water and soil, and is usually harmless. “Everyone’s exposed to them, but almost no one gets ill,” says Levin, who is now at Imperial College London. Despite aggressive treatment, the boy eventually passed away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This case illustrates a question that has plagued doctors for decades: &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01655-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01655-0" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;why do some people become severely ill from infections&lt;/a&gt; that leave others unscathed? What is it about some &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00128-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00128-w" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;people’s immune systems&lt;/a&gt; that makes them susceptible? And how might these variations affect how doctors try to prevent or treat disease?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, the boy from Malta had a brother and a cousin who had also fallen severely ill with mycobacteria infections. After years of searching, Levin and his colleagues eventually identified what made these children so sick: a genetic mutation affecting a receptor for interferon-γ, an immune molecule with myriad functions, including regulating inflammation&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Not long after that, a group in France discovered that similar mutations were responsible for rare cases of severe disease caused by another mycobacterial species — this time, a weakened form used as a tuberculosis vaccine&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have since amassed a broad library of mutations in hundreds of genes that underlie ‘inborn errors of immunity’ (IEIs) and that make millions of people around the world susceptible to a wide range of infectious diseases and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03885-w%5d%20that" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03885-w%5d%20that" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;immune-linked ailments&lt;/a&gt; that many people can simply shrug off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might seem obvious that differences in each person’s immune system can affect how well they fight off pathogens. But uncovering the specific causes of this variation has enabled researchers to find ways to treat — and even prevent — severe infections that used to seem like random cases of bad luck, says Isabelle Meyts, an oncologist and immunologist who studies IEIs at the university KU Leuven in Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discoveries have already begun to change clinical practice, for instance allowing doctors to genetically screen people for relevant mutations or supplement missing immune factors. And scientists are continuing to piece together the many ways in which genetic factors contribute to infectious diseases — especially in life-threatening cases. “What we’re realizing more and more is that there are probably inherited factors that predict who’s going to have severe reactions,” says Michael Abers, a physician-scientist studying infectious disease at Montefiore Einstein in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;From germ to host&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The germ theory of disease, popularized by Louis Pasteur in the nineteenth century, was revolutionary. The realization that microorganisms, invisible to the naked eye, could make people ill spurred public-health measures such as better hygiene, vaccines and anti-microbial drugs, which drastically improved outcomes for people with infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even with these tools, there are still people — particularly some children and older people — who become sick and die from infections that are typically preventable or treatable, suggesting that there are limitations to focusing mostly on pathogens in the fight against infectious disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1950s, some scientists were already drawing attention to the importance of the host, especially in cases in which ordinarily harmless microbes caused disease. Researchers have since discovered that one of the most important determinants of infection susceptibility might be a person’s genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00082-1/d41586-026-00082-1_51939358.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00082-1/d41586-026-00082-1_51939358.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Coloured scanning electron micrograph showing a blue sphere with yellow tiny spots." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00082-1/d41586-026-00082-1_51939358.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;SARS-CoV-2 virus particles (yellow) infect a cell (blue).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: NIAID/NIH/SPL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the most famous demonstrations of genetic mutations driving infection outcome is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01257-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01257-9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)&lt;/a&gt;, an inherited disease that leaves people without a functioning immune system and that is linked to mutations in more than a dozen genes. If left untreated, it typically leads to death before the age of two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, SCID is rare, occurring in an estimated 1 in 50,000 or so births. But inherited mutations that can cause problems in the immune system are much more common. Over the past few decades, researchers have found inborn errors of immunity linked to more than 500 genes&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In addition to infectious-disease susceptibility, these mutations are involved in other immune-system abnormalities, including autoimmune diseases and allergies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some mutations dampen the immune system and diminish its ability to fight off infections. But others can cause people to be hyper-responsive to infection, which can lead to runaway immune reactions that can turn deadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although some IEIs can cause a generalized vulnerability to pathogens, most of them put people at risk from specific microbes, such as mycobacteria, avian influenza virus, herpes simplex virus and the bacterium &lt;i&gt;Neisseria meningitidis&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Each infection has a different set of mechanisms,” says Steven Holland, physician-scientist specializing in infectious disease at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland. “And unsurprisingly, there are different genes that speak to” different infections. The mutations known so far tend to cause severe disease, although some have been linked to recurrent milder infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, there are genes that can boost a person’s ability to fend off pathogens. For example, a mutation in the gene encoding CCR5, a receptor on the surface of white blood cells, makes people resistant to HIV&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (although it increases the risk of severe infection with West Nile virus). And mutations in the gene encoding FUT2, a protein located in the mucosa of the gut, helps people to fend off norovirus, a highly contagious gastrointestinal infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;An expanding universe&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was clear that some infected people became severely ill, whereas others got barely a sniffle. A massive consortium of scientists, led by paediatrician and immunologist Jean-Laurent Casanova at the Rockefeller University in New York City, discovered that around 10% of people with severe COVID-19 harboured autoantibodies — rogue proteins that turn against a person’s own body. These autoantibodies attacked signalling molecules that help to mobilize the immune response, tamping down the immune defences&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Casanova and his colleagues have since found the same autoantibodies in a subset of people who develop severe disease from seasonal influenza, West Nile and many other diseases, as well as in those who experience rare adverse reactions to live vaccines, such as the yellow fever vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00086-1" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00082-1/d41586-026-00082-1_23944226.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How your first brush with COVID warps your immunity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not known exactly why and how autoantibodies develop. Some scientists, including Casanova, suspect that they might be the result of inherited or acquired mutations. He and others have identified some mutations that can give rise to these autoantibodies, such as deficiencies in various interferon-related genes. Whether such mutations can account for the majority of severe cases of these diseases remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are still working out the complex ways in which genetics contributes to infection outcome. Having a mutation doesn’t always make someone vulnerable: IEIs can behave unpredictably. Many people carry immunodeficiency-related mutations without ever experiencing their effects — a phenomenon known as ‘incomplete penetrance’. And although most IEIs with severe effects become apparent in childhood, some might lie dormant for decades. In unpublished work, Meyts and her team identified a person who has a mutation that is linked to inflammatory disease, but whose symptoms emerged only after a SARS-CoV-2 infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are still working to identify which factors influence the severity of IEIs. In a 2025 study, Dusan Bogunovic, a paediatric immunologist at Columbia University in New York City, and his colleagues discovered that, in about 4% of IEIs, the disease-causing variant can be expressed differently in different cells&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The team also found evidence that this process might be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, which are influenced by environmental factors — suggesting that, not only might the same IEIs manifest differently in different people, but the effects of these mutations could change over a person’s lifetime. Bogunovic’s team is currently searching for the factors, such as inflammation or certain infections, that might control this variable allele expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Treat and prevent&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doctors.catholichealthli.org/provider/bruce-mayerson/2404955" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Bruce Mayerson&lt;/a&gt;, co-chair of neurosciences at &lt;a href="https://www.catholichealthli.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Catholic Health&lt;/a&gt; and the chief of neurology at &lt;a href="https://www.catholichealthli.org/st-catherine-siena-hospital" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;St. Catherine of Siena Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, shares six major ways to mind your gray matter well before your hair goes gray.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;There are six major ways to mind your gray matter well before your hair goes gray. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jack Forbes / NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Eat this, not that…&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mayerson is a fan of the anti-inflammatory &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/11/01/health/6-easy-hacks-for-success-with-the-mediterranean-diet/"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, which emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts and olive oil, with fish and poultry in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuts, in particular, are &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/14/health/5-popular-nuts-ranked-by-nutritional-value-the-winner-is-clear/"&gt;packed with heart-healthy unsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt;, plant-based protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals. The doc recommended cashews, almonds and peanuts specifically.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean diet also limits ultra-processed foods, refined grains like white bread and rice, unhealthy fats like butter, added sugars, alcohol and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/20/health/red-and-processed-meats-linked-to-type-2-diabetes-risk-new-study/"&gt;red meat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think it necessarily needs to be completely excluded,” Mayerson said of red meat. “It is a very good source of protein, but it’s also a high-fat food.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“So, in general, things like chicken and poultry are probably better, not to mention that in terms of cholesterol, red meat can also be an issue for people who are managing that lipid problem,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Stay social and optimistic&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A recent study out of the University of Florida found that your brain’s “true age” can shift dramatically&lt;br&gt;based on how you live — with optimism, restorative sleep, stress management and strong&lt;br&gt;social connections acting like powerful anti-aging tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This research underscores that optimism and stress management can meaningfully slow brain aging, while strong social connections play a powerful role in supporting brain health, especially as we grow older,” Mayerson noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Walk this way&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aerobic (cardio) and anaerobic (strength/HIIT) exercises significantly benefit the brain by boosting blood flow, promoting new brain cells, enhancing the brain’s ability to change, improving memory and reducing cognitive decline — but that doesn’t mean you need to go nuts at the gym.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For aerobic activity, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/10/30/health/all-the-benefits-you-get-from-walking-ranked-by-step-count/"&gt;walking at a brisk pace&lt;/a&gt; can be just as good as running. Mayerson recommends setting a daily walk goal — and sticking to it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For my patients, I find that if you give them a goal, [like] you’re going to walk 2 miles every day or 3 miles every day, you’re going to do it at the same time each day,” he said. “You get into that sort of rhythm.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But if you’re thinking 18 holes at the local country club is meeting your movement quota, think again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people golf, and I think that’s great for your mind,” Mayerson said. “For the body, it may not be quite as effective because I think it’s hard on necks and backs, and you don’t really get any significant aerobic or anaerobic [benefit] unless you walk the golf course.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Exercise is important — but you don’t have to push yourself to your limit to reap the benefits. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;peopleimages.com – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Protect your head&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seems pretty obvious — hitting your skull on pavement? Not so great for your brain. But too many people skip helmets when riding bikes and scooters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think that’s probably one of the riskiest behaviors you can do,” Mayerson said. “Even if you think you’re not going quickly on one of these things, if you’re doing 15 or 20 miles an hour and you hit your head, you can have a serious traumatic brain injury, not to mention, broken bones.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;E-bikes are often 5-10 miles per hour faster than regular bikes, while powerful e-scooters can reach 40 to 55 mph. Mayerson said he’s seen &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/23/health/e-bike-and-e-scooter-injuries-are-soaring-in-us-heres-why/"&gt;brain injuries&lt;/a&gt; range from concussions to hemorrhages and skull fractures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“So helmets are very, very important, I can’t overemphasize that enough,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Keep reading!&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sure, it can be tempting to tune out — but staying informed on the news engages your mind and potentially lowers your risk of dementia, Mayerson said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Keeping yourself apprised of current events and being able to discuss these things with [family members] can lead to a little bit of controversy or something adversarial,” he added, “[but] keeping yourself in the loop, so to speak, is very important.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mayerson isn’t as sold on crosswords, Sudoku and other word games as a way to delay cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You’ll be great at crosswords and things like that if you practice them — not so sure that it translates into a dramatic effect on your dementia or slowing [it] down,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mayerson recommends regular sleep, but don’t take drugs to ease you into slumber.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Rawpixel.com – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Snooze without the booze&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Getting a good night’s rest is truly the coziest, comfiest way to stay healthy. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;REM sleep, in particular, helps the brain process and store new information and sort through emotional experiences. This is the sleep stage when most vivid dreaming occurs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re not catching enough ZZZs on your own, it may be tempting to raid your medicine cabinet to help yourself relax — but resist the urge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people use drugs like Xanax and Klonopin and things like that to sleep, and that’s not really a good idea,” Mayerson said. “Fatigue is a side effect of those medicines. They’re [anti-anxiety] drugs and should be used as such.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mayerson also &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/09/28/lifestyle/doctor-reveals-the-devastating-effects-wine-and-other-treats-can-have-on-your-sleep/"&gt;recommends against hitting the bottle&lt;/a&gt; before hitting the hay, as alcohol suppresses REM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People think you sleep better after a few drinks; you actually sleep worse, and you probably don’t even realize it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="143" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkd6a9j300b7b3m2nbhzwbcc@published"&gt;Remember hearing that you have a spoon’s worth of plastic in your brain? That’s what a study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03453-1"&gt;published last February&lt;/a&gt; in Nature Medicine suggested. Researchers at the University of New Mexico analyzed samples of brain tissue from dead people and found that they contained a truly alarming amount of teeny-tiny shards and flakes of polyethylene and other polymers. While the negative effects of such microplastics and nanoplastics on the body were unclear—and the scientists admitted that point—it was still an incredibly jarring discovery. “I certainly don’t feel comfortable with this much plastic in my brain,” &lt;a href="https://hscnews.unm.edu/news/hsc-newsroom-post-microplastics-human-brains"&gt;said Matthew Campen&lt;/a&gt;, a toxicologist who led the study. Plastic made up nearly 0.5 percent of the brain tissue of “normal individuals” that the team examined, an amount that Campen, aware of the size of the brain, characterized to the media as the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/03/health/plastics-inside-human-brain-wellness"&gt;equivalent of a spoon&lt;/a&gt;. Yikes!&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkd8jgj000063b7blna2fxfe@published"&gt;Well, now: double yikes. In the weeks after the paper was published, someone spotted that it contained a couple of &lt;a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/publishing/spoonful-of-plastics-in-your-brain-paper-has-duplicated-images/"&gt;duplicated images&lt;/a&gt;. That itself might have just been a sloppy clerical error. But over the summer, a group of scientists &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04045-3.epdf?sharing_token=67_cuBUO0UL1AeNVCgDqE9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PS5QtSs_irU94U55JE4Ar4Z5UOMBpR3_t_yCh0UzMgGKL-GztU5e15cffbRpDb67AMozIXlp82gM9YW2QGk63C5OxsW_ncVxqYJfdR7JAeVCZI4Lm6SNe2MQ8ERqGifs1OgQsP5qE_G-FoRGaatnnKUVXs-mVt2rnDNZCH-KhkeAl8JJ6iMM5a0HkEMmh7iEykGmqbwM7HNfyR0WQXdXyZjtqXmTquWmAFsHArsSnvC1hKOX7TDMRP-eAQchOqQQM%3D&amp;amp;tracking_referrer=www.theguardian.com"&gt;wrote to the journal&lt;/a&gt; where the study had appeared, highlighting “methodological limitations” in the research, namely that the paper may have failed to properly root out any “contamination introduced during sampling, sample preparation or detection.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="61" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkd8jglu00073b7b3u3xqpac@published"&gt;That is: Did the proverbial plastic spoon come from the brain tissue itself, or did some of it come from other sources, like labware or even the air? We just can’t tell. At any rate, as one of the scientists critical of the study put it to the Guardian &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/jan/13/microplastics-human-body-doubt"&gt;in a report published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;: “The brain microplastic paper is a joke.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkd8jgnl00083b7b9kurcs7y@published"&gt;“There’s a lot of plastic in your body” has become a not-uncommon refrain in headlines ever since the material was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/24/microplastics-found-in-human-blood-for-first-time"&gt;detected in human blood in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. But just &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; much plastic is in your body is up for debate. The issue isn’t even with just that one spoon paper. The 2022 blood-plastic paper also &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412022003270"&gt;received criticism&lt;/a&gt; shortly after it was published, and more recently, a study led by researchers at the University of Queensland &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.4c12599"&gt;assessed the methodology&lt;/a&gt; commonly used to detect microplastics in these investigations and found that it was prone to false positives (namely, mistaking fats for plastics).&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkd8jgst00093b7bck60eswz@published"&gt;None of this is to say that there affirmatively isn’t any&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;microplastic in your brain, blood, etc.—but how much is unclear, and when it comes to toxicity, the dose still makes the poison, even when we’re talking brain plastic. As Damian Carrington, an environment editor for the Guardian, writes: “The race to publish results, in some cases by groups with limited analytical expertise, has led to rushed results and routine scientific checks sometimes being overlooked.”*&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="160" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkd8jgv3000a3b7bo5nt8e7q@published"&gt;So too with the race to publicize them. In fall 2024, many of us were ridding our kitchens of a very common utensil, thanks to a piece in the Atlantic that instructed us to “&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/10/black-plastic-spatula-flame-retardants/680452/?utm_source=threads&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the-atlantic&amp;amp;utm_content=edit-promo"&gt;Throw Out Your Black Plastic Spatula&lt;/a&gt;.” The claim was that the implement contained chemicals from recycled computer parts—I’m typing, for example, on black computer keys—which were, as we slid that black plastic spatula across hot cooking surfaces, leaching into our food at frightening rates. I needed a second opinion before tossing mine, so I asked Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz, a regular Slate contributor and epidemiologist, for his take. He looked at the research underlying the Atlantic piece but &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2024/11/black-plastic-spatula-chemicals-flame-retardants.html"&gt;found no reason for alarm&lt;/a&gt;: You’d have to boil your spatula in oil, then drink that oil, to be exposed to a meaningful level of those iffy computer chemicals. And even then, you might be fine. Further, one of the spatula papers turned out to have &lt;a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/black-plastic"&gt;contained a math error&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkd8jgwo000b3b7bmd8hm83q@published"&gt;The real problem, I think, isn’t necessarily the sloppy studies themselves. There will always be sloppy studies, because the people who do science are human beings. There’s no evidence, as the Guardian points out, of fraud in the microplastics research. Scientists fight all the time about results, methodology—it’s part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="168" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkd8jgye000c3b7bfd0ho76t@published"&gt;The issue, rather, is our rush to make meaning out of such small scraps—shards? microparticles?, if you will—of science. Just this summer, &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/articles/orlando-bloom-spends-over-10-004000668.html"&gt;Orlando Bloom revealed&lt;/a&gt; that in order to purge the microplastics from his blood, he had had a $10,000 procedure, an operation that itself &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/orlando-bloom-tried-to-clean-his-blood-to-get-rid-of-microplastics-heres-what-the-science-says-261203"&gt;relies on plastic components&lt;/a&gt; (that could potentially contaminate the blood). This kind of “cleanse” outpaces any science that might suggest it is a meaningfully good use of funds or even simply one’s time. Bryan Johnson, the sallow billionaire who claims he wishes to “never die,” is selling $150 kits that allow you to draw your own blood at home, then send it to be evaluated for microplastics; having edited a piece &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/05/microplastics-test-blood-brain-spoon-bryan-johnson.html"&gt;in which a writer tries out the kit&lt;/a&gt;, I think you might as well consult a tarot deck. Plastic is everywhere, and it’s bad for the environment—we know this. It is also virtually impossible to escape, and it’s not clear whether trying to avoid the substance mitigates any kind of health concern.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkd8jh0l000d3b7bxam0l56o@published"&gt;The other issue—the fear, really—is that squabbles in science &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/opinion-whats-worrisome-about-white-house-focus-on-gold-standard-science/"&gt;can be weaponized&lt;/a&gt;, used as an excuse to curtail funding or to throw out commonsense policies that curb plastic use. The truth is that we don’t know what the future of microplastics research holds. We will have to keep doing it to find &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The pooch poses, pouts, and flops with total commitment, like he knows he is being watched. Set to Daryl Hall &amp;amp; John Oates’ “You Make My Dreams (Come True),” quick cuts make each habit funnier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Owner proves Golden Retriever is a ‘weird pup sometimes’ in video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The reel was shared by @aguyandagoldenn, a digital creator based in Greenville, South Carolina. Teddy is the star of the account, which boasts over 5.5 million followers. The latest post featuring the Golden Retriever went up one day ago with the caption, “He’s a weird pup sometimes…” It had 326.7K likes and 4.4K comments at the time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Teddy’s video opens with the on-screen line, “Weird things I’ve caught my dog doing…” First comes “Staring at me like this…,” as the dog drops low and locks eyes. Next is “Holding his toy like a human…,” and the segment shows the pooch on a bench with paws up. He grips a plush like a trophy, and in a weird comic timing, the toy slips and falls like a normal human moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Then the edit jumps to “Sleeping in the bathtub…,” with Teddy curled into the tub like it is his bed. After that, “Stealing my socks…,” catches him carrying a sock, eyes wide. “Having a mirror stare off…” follows, as Teddy squares up to his own reflection. The final beat reads, “Whatever this is…,” while he rolls outside, legs in the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fans replied fast in the comments.

"What I have is terminal but it's not terminal right now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chances cancer patients like Schlossman will live longer after diagnosis are better than ever before, according to &lt;a class="nd-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.cancer.org/research/cancer-facts-statistics/all-cancer-facts-figures/2026-cancer-facts-figures.html"&gt;a new report&lt;/a&gt; released Tuesday from the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 70% of people diagnosed with cancer in the United States now survive for five years or more, a milestone experts said is due to improvements in treatments and screening. In the 1970s, about 50% of people diagnosed with cancer survived five years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="img Image_img__VNXHO landscape lazy"&gt;&lt;img alt="Jane Schlossman, of Massapequa, was diagnosed with a type of..." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AMWVmNzI5YjMtNDVkYS00%3AM2Y2NmMxYzItMTIyYy00%2Fcopy-of-licancer260114.jpg%3Ff%3DLandscape%2B16%253A9%26w%3D768%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=828&amp;amp;q=80 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AMWVmNzI5YjMtNDVkYS00%3AM2Y2NmMxYzItMTIyYy00%2Fcopy-of-licancer260114.jpg%3Ff%3DLandscape%2B16%253A9%26w%3D768%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=1920&amp;amp;q=80 2x" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AMWVmNzI5YjMtNDVkYS00%3AM2Y2NmMxYzItMTIyYy00%2Fcopy-of-licancer260114.jpg%3Ff%3DLandscape%2B16%253A9%26w%3D768%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=1920&amp;amp;q=80"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jane Schlossman, of Massapequa, was diagnosed with a type of lung cancer less than a year ago. Credit: Courtesy Jane Schlossman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts said steady funding for research and clinical trials — which have faced federal cuts in recent months — are key to continued progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the more striking findings, doctors said, were among people with high-risk cancers. For example, in the 1990s, people diagnosed with liver cancer had a 7% chance of living five years. Now it's 22%. For people diagnosed with myeloma, that survival rate almost doubled from 32% to 62%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Cancer Society’s annual &lt;a class="nd-link" target="_blank" href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.70043"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; focuses on the survival rate among people with all cancers diagnosed between 2015 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Siegel, lead author of the report and the senior scientific director of surveillance research at the American Cancer Society, said in a statement the "stunning victory" is the result of "decades of cancer research that provided clinicians with the tools to treat the disease more effectively, turning many cancers from a death sentence into a chronic disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Richard Barakat, physician in chief and executive director of the Lake Success-based Northwell Health Cancer Institute, said the gains highlight the importance of innovative therapies for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nowadays, you select appropriate treatments for cancer patients by profiling their tumors to determine if a particular genetic mutation is driving the growth of their cancer," said Barakat, who was not involved with the American Cancer Society report. "Once you determine which mutations are driving their cancer, you can select a drug that targets that mutation and potentially reverses its effect. That's what's known as precision medicine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barakat also credited a "flood of immunotherapies" &lt;b&gt;—&lt;/b&gt; treatments that&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;help use the body’s own immune system to fight cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted the five-year survival rate for regional lung cancer nearly doubled, from 20% in the 1990s to 37%. Regional lung cancer includes cancer in the lungs, lymph nodes and other nearby parts of the body as opposed to distant or metastatic cancer, where the disease has spread far beyond the primary cancer site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ryan Sugarman, a gastrointestinal medical oncologist and medical site director for Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Nassau in Uniondale, said reduction in smoking and access to health care also helped drive up the survival rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Several of the cancers with [the] highest death rate have modifiable risk factors, and individuals can lower their risk by avoiding tobacco, minimizing alcohol, maintaining a healthy [weight] and receiving HPV vaccination, if age appropriate," he said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five-year survival rate for people with localized cancer increased from 54% to 69%. For people with metastatic cancer, where the disease has spread to other parts of their body, the survival rate increased from 17% to 35%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors emphasized the five-year survival rate does not mean the individual is cured of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Cancer Society estimates there will be 2.1 million new cancer diagnoses in the United States this year and more than 626,000 people will die from the disease. In New York, those estimates are 125,860 new cases of cancer and more than 31,140 deaths in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancers with the highest mortality rates are lung, colorectal and pancreatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugarman pointed to several concerning trends such as the rise in incidence of colorectal cancer in people younger than 50 and disparities such as Black men having more than twice the risk of prostate cancer death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Continued progress is dependent on support for cancer research, as well as public awareness of risk factors for developing cancer," Sugarman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;span class="author-image Byline_author-image__kHthS"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lisa L.

                Wildfire smoke towered over burned houses from the Palisades Fire on Jan. 10, 2025. The fires burned for days, blanketing the region in toxic smoke. The health effects are just beginning to become clear.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Last January, fires were raging across Los Angeles, smothering some 20 million people across the region in toxic smoke and ash.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;LA residents worried that the air was toxic, the soil contaminated, and the water poisoned. Questions swirled about the health risks created by the burns — and there were few answers at hand from city, state or federal leaders.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scientists from Los Angeles and around the country quickly scrambled into action as fires burned through the Pacific Palisades and Altadena. The priority, says UCLA physician and disaster researcher David Eisenman, was keeping people safe in the short term. But the fires also presented a moment to learn crucial missing information about the health effects of wildfires to help those affected and to better protect people's health from the inevitable next ones.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"This won't be the last wildfire that Los Angeles sees," says Eisenman. "Part of the community recovery process is to learn from what we experienced."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers fanned out across the city to collect what data and samples they could. Doctors started thinking of ways to collect patient data to better understand the immediate and long-term health impact. They soon joined together to form &lt;a href="https://lafirehealth.org/" target="_blank"&gt;a consortium that tied together 10 research institutions&lt;/a&gt;, developing a phalanx of research studies to explore some of the most pressing questions brought up by affected community members.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some questions were simple but frustratingly hard to find answers to, like: What was in the smoke? Other questions, like those exploring the long-term health impacts, will take years to untangle. But answers are beginning to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra-dangerous smoke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Wildfire smoke is dangerous under any conditions. Exposure to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5544451/wildfire-smoke-death-increases" target="_blank"&gt;high smoke levels&lt;/a&gt; is linked to respiratory problems such as&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/04/nx-s1-5492448/health-michigan-canada-smoke-minnesota-air-quality-wildfire" target="_blank"&gt;asthma and COPD&lt;/a&gt;, cardiovascular issues and even &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/26/nx-s1-5205298/exposure-to-wildfire-smoke-increases-the-risk-of-developing-dementia-study-says" target="_blank"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But from the first moment the Palisades and Eaton fires took hold last January, UCLA air pollution expert Yifang Zhu knew they were different. Because it wasn't just trees and plants burning: There was plastic from people's houses, and car batteries and asbestos tiles — a "toxic soup" of air pollutants, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;What was in that soup, and how dangerous it might be to human health — that wasn't clear. Official air quality monitors in downtown Los Angeles, miles away from the heart of the fires in Altadena and Pacific Palisades, &lt;a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2025-02/Final-LAFireAQWebinar-Presentation.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;recorded high levels of lead and arsenic&lt;/a&gt; in the air during the burns. Researchers from Caltech and the Georgia Institute of Technology&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;later measured lead concentrations in air samples both near and far from the fires. Lead levels, they found, were elevated, even miles away, signaling that smoke and ash from the burns spread the dangerous heavy metal widely.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But many scientists suspected the smoke and ash spread other toxic particles and gases widely, too — chemicals that standard EPA and state monitors didn't test.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We need to test more than just what the EPA calls for. And the EPA has limited resources," says Kari Nadeau, an environmental health scientist at Harvard University and one of the leads for the new research consortium. "But as academics, we can test for hundreds of things all at once, which helps the community. Because what you don't know, you don't know, but it can still hurt you."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Before the fires, Zhu and her team had been getting ready to sample the air at Aliso Canyon, where a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/02/18/467230988/leaking-natural-gas-well-in-california-is-permanently-sealed" target="_blank"&gt;natural gas leak&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 had caused major health problems for nearby residents. When the fires broke out, the team pivoted, taking their sampling equipment as close to the fires as they could. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That opportunity was special. Researchers are rarely ready to deploy at a moment's notice to capture samples during disasters such as the LA fires. The special circumstances let Zhu's team "set the stage about what's going on during this active fire burning all week," Zhu says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-105373" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Dust and ash from the Palisades and Eaton fires spread across the Los Angeles region. Scientists are still learning about the contaminants and toxic components in the debris left behind after the fires and the health consequences of being exposed to it.

    &lt;span class="credit" aria-label="Image credit"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Zhu's team set up air filters to capture the ash, and they captured air samples inside and outside homes in the Palisades and Eaton fire regions. In the air samples, they looked for more than 20 different volatile organic compounds — gases, many of which harm human health, and are likely to be produced by the fires. And while the fires were still burning, they &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.5c00919" target="_blank"&gt;measured high levels of benzene&lt;/a&gt;, a carcinogen, at their outdoor sites.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lingering risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The high benzene levels dissipated after the burning stopped, Zhu found. But other dangerous gases actually increased later on, especially indoors. A few health-harming gases, including toluene and carbon tetrachloride, became &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;concentrated inside people's homes a few weeks after the fire.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The message was clear. "The fire impact doesn't really disappear with the active flame," Zhu says. Homes themselves can absorb dangerous gases in the drywall, furniture and other soft materials, releasing them for days and weeks after the smoke has dissipated. People need to know that their homes might be contaminated long after the fire is out, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That wasn't the only lingering risk. Another research team started to look for a contaminant called hexavalent chromium, which c&lt;a href="https://www.osha.gov/hexavalent-chromium/health-effects#:~:text=Adverse%20health%20effects%20associated%20with,pitted%20ulcer%20covered%20with%20fluid." target="_blank"&gt;an cause cancer&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes known as the "Erin Brockovich" contaminant, made famous by the movie of the same name. It can be produced when fires burn through certain types of soil or rock, as well as during industrial processes like welding. It's not often searched for after wildfires, but the researchers &lt;a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-7401328/v1" target="_blank"&gt;found it lingering in the air&lt;/a&gt; around cleanup sites long after the fires were out.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's actually one of those things that … makes you pay attention differently," says Joe Allen, an exposure scientist at Harvard University, who has been conducting ongoing research on building safety after the fires. And the contaminant was found in tiny particles so small that they can penetrate deep into people's lungs, bodies, and even directly to their brains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We've seen hexavalent chromium in soils after fires. I don't think anybody expected to see it in air. I don't think anybody expected to see it exclusively in the nanoparticle size range," Allen says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ash also contaminated people's homes, as well as soil and water across the region. The water impacts seemed to clear quickly, though longer-term effects are still being tracked. But &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41370-025-00796-w" target="_blank"&gt;levels of lead&lt;/a&gt; and other heavy metals inside people's homes and in the soil around them often remained high, even after cleanup was supposedly done.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"That is an ongoing question," says Allen. "Do we have enough funds to remediate all these properties, or are we just putting some people back into properties that are not properly cleared?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Zhu was impressed by how much she and others learned about the dangerous smoke and ash. But she also worries they probably only scratched the surface. "We are only detecting things that our method allows us to detect. So even though we learn a lot from that, you know, I wonder what we missed," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this all mean for people's health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scientists have known that in the short term, wildfire smoke exposure leads to more respiratory issues, such as asthma and COPD; increases the risk of developing dementia; and affects&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03777-6" target="_blank"&gt; people's immune responses&lt;/a&gt;. But the full array of impacts, and the long-term costs of exposure, are still muddy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We know a lot about the health effects of wildfire smoke," says Allen. But "we don't know all that much about urban wildfire smoke. We certainly don't know what happens when you expose a population of 20 million people in the greater Los Angeles area to smoke like this, enriched in these toxic metals and other pollutants. "&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The research is beginning to uncover some of the health impacts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cheng and colleagues collected data from the emergency room at Cedars-Sinai, one of the busiest in the region, and particularly close to the Palisades fire. In the 90 days following the fires, they saw a 24% increase in respiratory issues — and a &lt;a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.10.079" target="_blank"&gt;47% jump in heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was "very striking," she says. "This actually surpassed heart attack rates during January of all prior years, even during the worst years of COVID."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-105374" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                Homes and businesses in parts of Los Angeles were reduced to rubble and ash. The fires caused a spike in visits to some emergency rooms for issues such as respiratory problems and heart attacks. And many people's blood showed signs of health disruptions. Scientists are tracking many local residents to understand the long-term health impacts of the fires.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Abnormal blood tests also spiked, increasing by more than 100% over previous levels. That included unexpected blood sugar readings, signs of a disrupted immune system, and changes to people's metabolic profiles — signals, Cheng says, of bodywide stresses that could be precursors to many different health problems down the line.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"For a very large number of people who lived through these January wildfires, the wildfire exposures led to some kind of a biochemical or metabolic stress in the body that likely affected not just one, but many organ systems," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team is now tracking some of those patients, trying to understand what health issues their unusual bloodwork might have signaled coming.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The ER data is likely just skimming the surface, says Eisenman. Longer-term health problems, from heart issues to mental health stresses, are likely to linger or develop in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ongoing research will explore the different health outcomes for people who experienced different levels of smoke and toxin exposure. A UCLA-led study has enrolled over 4,000 people from across the city to follow their health changes long-term. Another study will focus on the specific health outcomes for those who stayed behind at their homes to fight the fires, giving them extraordinarily high smoke doses. The &lt;a href="http://lafirehealth.org" target="_blank"&gt;LA Fire Health study consortium&lt;/a&gt; is also tracking the long-term health impacts on firefighters and first responders.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Much of the emerging research is being supported by private philanthropy, says Eisenman. The wildfires happened just before the Trump administration began its campaign to tighten budgets for many of the science agencies that have historically funded post-disaster research, like the National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That gap was really filled in by the research community, who did ongoing and extensive and really thoughtful testing of air, of water, of soil, of debris for toxins, and really rapidly communicated those results back to the community," he says. But how to financially support the long-term future of some key studies, he says, is still uncertain, because many major federal research funding resources — like NSF and the National Institute of Health — have shifted priorities under the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to protect yourself and your family&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The biggest questions for the ongoing research, many of the researchers say, are about how best to protect yourself from similar fires in the future.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Allen says there are some clear lessons. Overall, the less smoke one inhales, the better. So while outside, he says it's crucial to wear an N95 mask, or even a respirator that can protect you from the fire's gases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Indoors, keeping clean air is crucial, says Zhu. Using air filters, ideally HEPA-rated, can lower indoor pollution significantly. Carbon filters are particularly effective at removing the gases, Allen says. People can also install HEPA filters in a car's air-handling system to keep the air clean while they drive.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You want to control what you can control," says Allen. So inside your space, clean up dust and ash thoroughly. Filter the air. And consider a low-cost air monitor to keep track of the air quality inside.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For people most impacted by the fires, Allen stresses that adequate &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41370-025-00796-w" target="_blank"&gt;cleanup of soil and buildings is critical&lt;/a&gt;. "It was a bit of the Wild West out there" after the fires, he says. A lack of standardized testing protocols and a hodgepodge of policies from different insurers "really harmed the survivor community."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That lack of guidance left many unsure whether their homes were safe to live in again, and many others were forced to go back to homes that were &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/12/29/us/insurers-smoke-damaged-homes-toxins.html" target="_blank"&gt;demonstrably still unsafe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We need more coordinated recommendations and rules to help people know whether their homes are safe," Allen says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It will take years to get a full picture of the health impacts of the LA fires, many of the researchers say. But it's critical to learn from the tragedy, says Nadeau, the Harvard environmental health scientist — to "be able to say, OK, in the future, here's what to do to protect your children or protect your elderly community against stroke," or lung cancer, or the myriad other risks from the wildfires that will, inevitably, come again.&lt;/p&gt;

You can be standing right in front of them, speaking clearly, and still receive no response. Yet, the faintest sound from the kitchen can instantly grab their full attention. It’s as though dogs operate with two completely different listening modes. One Golden Retriever’s owner proves that the “selective hearing” theory in a video that many viewers are relating to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Golden Retriever has two very different types of hearing in cute video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The account @hudsonbegood posted &lt;span&gt;a video f&lt;/span&gt;eaturing Hudson, a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt;, whose selective hearing is on full display. On-screen text explains that Golden Retrievers have “two types of hearing,” and the clip quickly proves the point with a side-by-side comparison of Hudson’s reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the first example, Hudson is stretched out on the floor, looking completely relaxed and uninterested in his surroundings. His owner calls his name and asks if he wants to go outside for a walk. Despite the familiar words, Hudson doesn’t move a muscle. He remains sprawled on the floor, appearing content to ignore the suggestion entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That indifference disappears almost instantly in the next moment. As soon as the sound of a peanut butter jar opening echoes through the kitchen, Hudson springs into action. The dog, who was lounging just seconds earlier, quickly gets up and heads straight toward his owner. His posture and focus make it clear that this is a sound worth responding to. His owner then presents the peanut butter jar, confirming exactly what caught his attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the caption, Hudson’s owner adds that this special type of hearing isn’t limited to peanut butter alone. She notes that Hudson can also detect the sound of banana peels, suggesting his ears are finely tuned to anything remotely related to snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Viewers found the video extremely relatable and filled the comments with stories of their own dogs’ selective listening habits. One person joked that those food-related sounds are “like music to their ears.” Meanwhile, another said Hudson clearly knows what he wants and when to respond. Others shared similar experiences, including dogs who appear instantly at the sound of a cheese drawer opening or an ice dispenser running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/202418-video-owner-reveals-golden-retrievers-two-types-hearing" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Video: Owner Reveals Golden Retriever’s Two Types of Hearing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Video: Owner Reveals Golden Retriever’s Two Types of Hearing&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 09:26:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxNQjlDSnZRdDl0b3FyMENYUWRnb2tzMWpLWkl4YTRKZXhhYzktb1FkMjZMUVlvRXhWemtvcXpXWEJHUm1nVG5nS2dhRXo5NFVaLVVzV3lmQU5xaWpkLVF4Sng5eVkwNEFpZjdGaURta2V0VFJfaWg0UXU2ZE5LTEhuZjhEV1pnaElBaVJJakprQTV4dDdGd3Rv</guid></item><item><title>视频：金毛猎犬让陌生人快乐并获得粉丝-雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/video-golden-retriever-makes-strangers-085744152.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Walking through Belfast, you might run into the city’s most popular local celebrity. Maddie, the friendly face at @maddiethebad.e, is essentially a one-dog welcoming committee for her neighborhood. A recent video shows her holding court in her yard with her favorite plushie, Tiger. She’s just a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; doing what she does best: existing warmly, wagging happily, and pulling people into her orbit while her mom watches nearby, probably used to this by now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Golden Retriever’s friendly nature makes strangers’ days more delightful&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The clip starts with a mailman stopping his route just to give Maddie some attention. She stands by the ledge, tail wagging, while receiving some top-tier neck scritches. She even places a paw on his arm to make sure he doesn’t leave too soon. When the man offers her a treat, she accepts it after briefly dropping her Tiger. Even with a bag full of parcels, he can’t seem to resist her charm. He truly looks like he’d stay all day if he could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Things get even busier when a second worker joins the huddle. Suddenly, Maddie is being fussed over by two people at once, and she is loving every second. She leans into the pets, soaking up the attention. Soon, a group of four strangers walking by spots the love fest. They can’t help but cross the lane to see what all the excitement is about. Maddie’s owner joked that Maddie and Tiger weren’t sure how to handle the sudden fame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Before long, the crowd grows to four new fans. Maddie handles the “paparazzi” with total grace, accepting head scratches from everyone. She eventually flops over for some high-quality belly rubs on the grass. It’s the kind of interaction that probably made everyone’s afternoon significantly better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With over 7,400 likes, it’s clear Maddie has a global fanbase now, too. Commenters are joking that the Belfast Tourist Board needs to put her on the payroll. Some people say that if they were there, they would never leave. We’re not sure we would either!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/202441-video-golden-retriever-makes-strangers-happy-gains-fans" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Video: Golden Retriever Makes Strangers Happy &amp;amp; Gains Fans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Video: Golden Retriever Makes Strangers Happy &amp;amp; Gains Fans&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 08:57:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOTlEwTjVsdnRyLVNidHZqY1AxdnZpamNremZZT0hMOTB3SHo3elFGVUFMTkoyampCejUxWGx1c1ZNTGN6SWxmYUdmcEZIOWpFcUdJVm94NlEtMF8wdEo5WjBremxsczdMTGtNUy1xTkhwNk00ZDA0dmpoandFakpjQVA3d3lSMU5HcFcwTkxoaVFNSUdMWDE5VjZB</guid></item><item><title>你的大脑什么时候才是真正的“成人” ？ ：短波- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2026/01/14/nx-s1-5668450/science-brain-development-aging</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;For some neuroscientists, the question of when the brain "stops" developing is headache-inducing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was kind of this unfathomable question," &lt;a href="https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/duncan.astle/" target="_blank"&gt;Duncan Astle, a researcher&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Cambridge says. "It's this question neuroscientists hate to be asked."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's this in pop culture that something happens in the human brain at 25 years-old. Suddenly, we're developed. We can finally make rational decisions. We might even regret some of our past…indiscretions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But a recent paper in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-65974-8" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the journal &lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;from Astle's lab suggests that may not be the case.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team found four distinct turning points in brain development across people's lifespan. Specifically, they found that the brain may be in its "adolescent" phase until the age of 32.&lt;/p&gt;

For stress and mental health, evidence-based interventions like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness meditation, and regular physical activity are highly effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;Prioritising quality sleep through consistent sleep schedules, limiting screens before bed, and treating sleep apnea is also essential. Building social connections, whether through community groups, friendships, or therapy, reduces isolation and supports emotional resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;For individuals with autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, timely medical treatment and anti-inflammatory diets (such as the Mediterranean diet) help lower cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;Reducing exposure to environmental pollutants, such as through the use of air purifiers and avoiding high-traffic areas during exercise, is also beneficial. Emotional well-being plays a vital role in heart health. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Activities that bring meaning or connection, such as walking with a friend or focusing on purpose in daily life, can lower stress and support healthier behaviors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;Caring for your emotional health isn't separate from caring for your heart; both are deeply interconnected. Taking medications as directed is another key factor in preventing heart attacks or stroke. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;If you have been prescribed treatment for high blood pressure, high cholesterol or other risk factors, following your clinician's guidance and monitoring your numbers ensures those risks stay under control.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Well, Comet doesn’t just beg; she puts on a full-blown production. This Michigan pup, known on Instagram as @peachycomet22, is a total character. When she’s not busy &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/video-toilet-paper-chase-between-112437074.html" data-ylk="slk:stealing toilet paper;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;stealing toilet paper&lt;/a&gt; (her usual hobby), she’s 100% focused on her one true love: peanut butter. You have to see the way she works for it in this video. It’s not just a look, though; she has a whole “prayer ritual” involving her hind legs and the air that makes it impossible to say no to this &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; in need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Golden Retriever’s refill request to owner in cute video melts hearts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The clip starts with Comet walking up to her mom, carrying an empty peanut butter jar in her mouth. When she gets asked why she brought the jar over, she launches her signature move. She hops up on her back legs and waves her front paws toward the sky, like she’s summoning the peanut butter gods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It is not every day that you see such a level of dedication to getting what you want. Even when her mom points out the obvious fact that the jar is empty, Comet just stares back with those massive, pleading eyes as if to say, “Yeah, that’s exactly why we’re having this meeting, Mom.”&lt;br&gt;The negotiation continues with Comet sitting as sweetly as possible, clutching the jar in her mouth while her mom asks if it’s her job to provide a refill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This kicks off another round of the “pleading dance,” where Comet starts bouncing up and down in this hilarious, full-body “yes!” motion. Just in case anyone was still confused, she lets out this sharp little bark to officially seal the deal.

					&lt;p&gt;Israeli scientists have developed an innovative method to track the human body’s circadian rhythms, finding in a new peer-reviewed study that female sex hormones have a dramatic effect on the setting of these internal circadian clocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every human body has a central circadian clock in the brain that helps control its daily rhythms — but there are also circadian clocks within almost every cell in the body that follow their own tick-tocking beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers mapped circadian clocks across many cells using their method, called CircaSCOPE, to find that these female sex hormones — especially progesterone — along with the stress hormone cortisol, have a dramatic effect on the setting of these internal timers.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p id="gpt-passback"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;When these clocks are not coordinated, people can experience serious health problems, including sleep disorders, diabetes and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body “needs to synchronize millions of clocks because they are present in every cell in our body,” said Prof. Gad Asher of the Weizmann Institute of Science’s Asher lab, recently speaking to The Times of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="timesofisrael" data-from="New study shows that female sex hormones can impact the body’s inner clocks"&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p class="newsletter-error newsletter-article-error"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
		
&lt;p&gt;“Sex hormones are very important in shifting the clock,” Asher said. “Female hormones have a much more prominent effect compared to male hormones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that the researchers still “don’t know how this influences men.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asher noted that the experiments were done in cell cultures and have not yet been tested in animals or humans.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;However, he said, “We now know how these clocks communicate, so maybe we can explain their involvement in various disorders and pathologies, and help patients whose internal timing is disrupted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research could also shed light on disruptions to circadian clocks during menstruation, pregnancy and menopause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, led by Dr. Gal Manella, Dr. Saar Ezagouri, and Nityanand Bolshette, was published in the scientific journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67349-5"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Our internal clocks sometimes beat to different times&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, Asher said, “people thought that there is only one main clock in the brain which responds to light and dark and coordinates our daily physiology, metabolism, and behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, about 25 years ago, scientists discovered that there are “clocks in every cell, in every tissue” in the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circadian clocks are affected not only by external signals such as sunlight but also by signals carried through the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;When the body’s internal time is not aligned with the environment, it could lead to many pathologies, Asher said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The best example is jet lag or shift workers, in which the person’s internal time is not in accordance with the environmental time,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The brain receives information from the eyes about light and darkness,” Asher said. “Light and dark are the main time signals for the brain. But now, in the past year, it’s becoming more and more evident that illnesses might be related to the fact that clocks in different organs are not synchronized with each other.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, he said, “The clock in the liver should be synchronized, or should show a similar time as the clock in the kidney or the clock in the brain, but this is not always the case.”&lt;/p&gt;

(Courtesy/Asher Lab)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Low oxygen levels impact circadian rhythms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a series of studies on animal models, researchers in Asher’s lab showed that oxygen acts like a signal helping internal clocks know what time it is. When oxygen levels change, cells use that information to adjust internal clocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Asher joined an expedition to La Rinconada, Peru, the highest inhabited settlement in the world, located 5,300 meters (17,388 feet) above sea level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this high altitude, Asher said the lower levels of oxygen altered the daily rhythm of many genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings might be of relevance to the fact that many low oxygen-related pathologies, such as heart disease and asthma exacerbation, show daytime occurrence, in particular during the early morning hours,” Asher said.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A wall of clocks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other signals carried through the blood that might serve as time tellers for internal clocks, Asher said, “yet their identity was only partially known.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Asher’s work, these blood-borne signals had not been fully mapped because researchers lacked a precise and efficient method for tracking the clock’s response to different signals over a full 24-hour cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Weizmann scientists’ &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26210-1"&gt;CircaSCOPE&lt;/a&gt; uses an array of human cells, each representing a different time of day, resembling a wall lined with clocks showing the current time in major cities around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asher’s lab was not damaged during the Iranian ballistic missile strike in June 2025, though he noted that some of the experiments used for the research paper were delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the researchers were able to monitor the clock in every cell in a petri dish in the culture. When they exposed the cell to a signal, they could “characterize if the clock was moving forward, backward, or not responding,” Asher said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, it would have taken the researchers months to do this work. He said that the novel method enables them to screen for dozens of compounds within a single week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we suspect that a certain compound affects the clock, we add it to the cells, and we can see exactly where their clocks are moving in each cell,” said Asher. “This is a very powerful approach which can generate a lot of information about how the clock is responsive to different signals.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The importance of the Cry2 protein&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to uncovering the influence of sex hormones, Asher’s study revealed that the clock component receiving these signals in the blood is the protein CRY2 (Cryptochrome 2), rather than PER2 (Period 2), as previously believed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It seems that the sex hormones, as well as many other signals, are acting through the CRY2 protein,” he said. “It probably transfers the information into the clock in the cell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“From an evolutionary angle, that’s intriguing,” said Prof. Yoav Gothilf of Tel Aviv University’s School of Biochemistry, Neurobiology and Biophysics, whose lab explores various aspects of the circadian clock and its significance in the life of the organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gothilf, who was not involved in the study, explained that in early, simple organisms, CRY2-like proteins responded directly to light, acting like a light sensor. As animals became more complex, CRY2 kept its job of synchronizing internal clocks, but the signal it listened to changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It seems the role of CRY2 in synchronizing clocks has been conserved, but the signal it responds to has changed, from light in early life forms to hormones in mammals,” Gothilf said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gothilf said that Asher’s study suggests that “daily, age-specific waves of hormones can shift the timing of our internal clocks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings offer a “compelling” biological explanation for “how a morning-loving child will turn into a night-owl teenager, and later drift back toward morningness as an adult.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asher said that his lab will continue to research the roles of these hormones in circadian clocks, perhaps testing the idea on lab animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can now identify compounds, and we identify that the sex hormones are important, changing throughout life,” he said. “Identifying molecules that are potent time signals for clocks has major importance in treatments in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
