&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Millions of Americans have high cholesterol, which can lead to heart disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A bedtime snack rich in fiber and plant protein may help lower cholesterol. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For a cholesterol-lowering late-night snack, our Chia Seed Pudding checks all the boxes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have high cholesterol, you’re not alone. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, millions of Americans have high cholesterol (aka hyperlipidemia).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This condition, defined as total blood &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/myths-about-high-cholesterol-to-stop-believing-8760519" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cholesterol levels higher than 200 mg/dL&lt;/a&gt;, is a leading risk factor for heart disease. However, that doesn’t mean you’re destined for heart troubles. “Keeping cholesterol levels in a healthy range helps reduce the risk of plaque buildup in the arteries, which can lead to heart disease over time,” says &lt;a href="https://www.topnutritioncoaching.com/registered-dietitians#kathleen-benson" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kathleen Benson, RDN, CSSD, CPT&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, healthy meals are the foundation of a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7836633/high-cholesterol-diet-plan-for-beginners/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cholesterol-lowering diet&lt;/a&gt;. But snacks can help, too—even the ones you eat before bed, like our ​​&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seed-pudding-8430793" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Chia Seed Pudding&lt;/a&gt;. It’s loaded with ingredients that can help reduce cholesterol. Yet, it’s light and satisfying enough that it won’t mess with your sleep. No wonder dietitians are huge fans. Here’s how it can help keep your heart healthy.

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s High in Fiber  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the myriad benefits of enjoying a high-fiber diet is that it can help lower cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “When I have a client trying to manage high cholesterol levels, we focus on getting more fiber and healthier fats in their diet,” says &lt;a href="https://bebalancednutritionrd.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Meggie Connelly, M.S., RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;. Filled with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seeds-benefits-11705262" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fiber-rich chia seeds&lt;/a&gt;, our Chia Seed Pudding delivers a hefty 11 grams of fiber per serving.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds contain a mix of both &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;soluble and insoluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But it’s their soluble fiber that’s behind chia’s cholesterol-lowering powers. The reason? Soluble fiber can absorb some of the cholesterol in your gut, removing it from the body before it can cause trouble. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Low in Saturated Fat &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Interestingly, research has shown that cholesterol from food doesn’t always affect your blood cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The real culprit is saturated fat, found mainly in full-fat dairy, red and processed meat, lard and ghee. Saturated fat tells your liver to rev up its cholesterol production, which provides far more cholesterol than the amount we absorb from food.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since this chia pudding is made with almond milk, it contains merely 1 gram of saturated fat per serving. If almond milk isn’t your thing, feel free to sub in another &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dietitians-favorite-plant-based-milk-11733338" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based milk&lt;/a&gt; like soy, cashew or oat milk or low-fat cow’s milk. Just steer clear of coconut milk and full-fat cow’s milk, which are both high in saturated fat. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Contains Plant Protein  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you have high cholesterol or not, choosing a late-night snack that contains some protein is the key to staying satiated all night long. “This will help you feel full during the night and help control blood sugar levels so you’re not starving by the morning,” says&lt;a href="https://www.brannoninbalancenutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Brannon Blount, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. Each serving of this chia pudding delivers 7 grams of protein. And not just any kind of protein. All of its protein is plant protein, which has been linked to better heart health. It’s so beneficial that the American Heart Association recommends getting most of our protein from plant sources like the chia seeds and nuts in this recipe.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-look-for-in-a-heart-healthy-bedtime-snack"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What to Look For in a Heart-Healthy Bedtime Snack &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A combination of fiber and protein.&lt;/strong&gt; Consider this the magic duo. “Fiber and protein combined, or paired together with an assortment of foods, can support steady blood sugar and satiety,” Benson says. That’s important because chronically high blood sugar levels can lead to diabetes, which increases heart disease risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients that are easy to digest.&lt;/strong&gt; When you’re trying to get some quality zzz’s, the last thing you need to eat is something that will upset your tummy or delay sleep even further. Choose something light, easy to digest and satisfying, yet low in fat and added sugars. In addition to chia pudding, oatmeal, popcorn and cereal with low-fat milk are all great options.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Something simple to assemble. &lt;/strong&gt;After a long day, it’s normal to experience some decision fatigue. But, instead of reaching for something with empty calories (we’re looking at you, bag of chips), choose something nutrient-dense that you can easily whip up. “Your late-night snack needs to be quick and easy to put together, like a banana and nut butter, or a peanut butter and sliced strawberry sandwich on whole-grain bread. Or make your chia pudding in advance,” says Connelly. “If you have to spend 30 minutes making your late-night snack, it’s not going to be something you do consistently.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Late-night snacking may get a bad rap, but if you didn’t eat enough during the day, a little nibble before bed might help you fall and stay asleep. That said, if you have high cholesterol, there are some considerations to keep in mind. If cholesterol is an issue, dietitians recommend choosing a snack that’s &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/heart-healthy-high-fiber-snack-recipes-8700225" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich in fiber, low in saturated fat&lt;/a&gt; and contains some protein. Our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seed-pudding-8430793" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Chia Seed Pudding&lt;/a&gt; checks all the boxes. So, whip some up today. You can double (or even quadruple) the recipe. And it will stay fresh in your fridge for up to three days for a hassle-free bedtime snack your heart will thank you for. &lt;br&gt;

Sometimes these mood swings can and should be examined as cause for concern, but a few TikTok creators explained how it's also good to take a step back and analyze our feelings before jumping to conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a video, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@anania00" rel="nofollow"&gt;TikTok content creator Anania&lt;/a&gt; told their followers that after eating, all of the depressive thoughts they were having before had simply gone away. Many people were quick to agree, while other content creators were able to put a name to that phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;There are four things we should ask ourselves using the HALT technique before beginning to spiral:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's consider, though, I'm not a [expletive] and I'm just hungry at this moment, you know what I mean?" &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@anania00/video/7248847178918169902" rel="nofollow"&gt;Anania began in their video&lt;/a&gt;. "Then we might be able to start our healing journey as a unit because I haven't thought about suicide in the past 20 minutes, and I just had a 3-piece from Popeye's. There's a correlation here, is all I'm saying."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Anania's initial video was meant to be humorous, it sparked a conversation about how many of our negative emotions are often tied to simple issues that can be solved — i.e., eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-06/things-ask-ourselves-using-halt-before-spiraling.png" alt="woman using the HALT technique to determine she's hungry and not spiraling" title="4 Things To Ask Yourself Using The HALT Technique Before Spiraling" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Photology1971 | Shutterstock &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/stop-obsessive-negative-thoughts-become-positive-person"&gt;5 Simple Ways To Combat Obsessive Negative Thoughts — And Become A More Positive Person&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Am I hungry?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@zairell777/video/7250268182869478699" rel="nofollow"&gt;video stitching Anania's original clip&lt;/a&gt;, another content creator, @zairell777, pointed out that there is a way we can look within ourselves to stop our emotions from spiraling. "This person is spot [expletive] on," she said of Anania's revelation that they felt better after having a meal. She explained that it's part of a DBT skill that she had learned and was called HALT, an acronym for Hunger, Anger, Lonely, and Tired.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're feeling anything negative, if you feel any negative emotions [or] you're having some negative thought patterns, run down the list and then act accordingly," she continued. "Were you suicidal or did you just need some chicken?" She acknowledged that while that's not the case all the time, for many occurrences, being in a negative headspace can easily be solved by eating. The phenomenon, also called being "hangry," isn't an irrational feeling to have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0269629" rel="nofollow"&gt;findings published in the peer-reviewed journal &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0269629" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/a&gt;, data showed that hunger was associated with 37% of changes in irritability, 34% in anger, and 38% in pleasure, suggesting that these emotions were caused by fluctuations in hunger. Researchers have even found that low blood glucose levels can trigger irritability, causing people to have a shorter fuse than usual when hungry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Am I angry?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anger isn't exactly a pleasant emotional state, but it is completely normal, and it's important to acknowledge that. Psychiatrist and addiction specialist David Streem, MD, is a proponent of using the HALT method and he explained, “Just because you feel angry doesn’t mean there’s something wrong with you,” he told the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/halt-hungry-angry-lonely-tired" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. “But chronic, persistent anger is unhealthy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to make that distinction. He went on to say, “Focus on who’s in the driver’s seat. When I’m upset and it’s time to move on to my next activity — to go home, to go to work — I should be able to turn that off and let it go in a real way, not just packing it down. That way, in my next activity, I can be present when I’m with my family or working with co-workers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/reason-you-cant-get-past-anger"&gt;turn that anger off&lt;/a&gt;, and essentially move on, as Dr. Streem described, then you have a good grasp on your emotions and don't have cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/signs-carrying-more-anger-realize"&gt;5 Signs You Might Be Carrying More Anger Than You Realize, According To Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Am I lonely?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loneliness and feeling isolated can open the door to intrusive thoughts, which is why experts agree it's important, when you're feeling vulnerable, to determine if what you really need is human connection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://cl.kp.org/natl/home/refcontainerpage.dam.nohf.public.html?damrefpath=/content/dam/clinicallibrary/scal/mem_ed/healthed/nutrition_month/chl035e-8.pdf&amp;amp;accessvia=scal_chl" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kaiser Permanente&lt;/a&gt; shared, once you have isolated loneliness as the cause for your negative emotions, you can take action by reaching out to loved ones. Additionally, you can make a plan to increase your community by joining local clubs or even trying out a new hobby. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-06/things-ask-ourselves-using-halt-before-spiraling-am-i-lonely.png" alt="4 Things To Ask Yourself Using HALT Technique Before Spiraling, Am I Lonely" title="4 Things To Ask Yourself Using The HALT Technique Before Spiraling" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Dmytro Sheremeta | Shutterstock &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lacyhartselle/video/7213437985717620014" rel="nofollow"&gt;In another video,&lt;/a&gt; TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lacyhartselle" rel="nofollow"&gt;creator Lacy&lt;/a&gt; expanded on how we can use HALT to check in with ourselves if we feel our emotions spiraling. "This is a good way to assess yourself when you're feeling overwhelmed or vulnerable and your thoughts are starting to spiral," Lacy said of the acronym. "Do I need to express some feelings here? Am I lonely? Do I need to phone a friend or at least journal to myself?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lacy explained that HALT can help us catch ourselves before we turn our negative emotions and thoughts onto another person. "Am I Hungry? Am I Angry? Am I Lonely? Am I Tired? Do I need to address these things?" She added, "After you take action to meet your own needs and to check in with yourself, you can function from a more clear-headed and balanced space." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Am I tired?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much like hunger, being tired is a physical state that can impact our emotions. As Dr. Streem stated, “Fatigue is like being hungry — it’s a condition that affects the brain.” It's as simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/habit-well-rested-people-use-fall-asleep-quickly"&gt;aren't getting enough sleep&lt;/a&gt; or you've even just had one bad bout of tossing and turning, acknowledging it allows you to make a simple action plan to help yourself. You can commit to a new sleep routine, cut out caffeine after noon, set a reasonable bedtime, or even indulge in some nice new bedding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;In the comments section, many people agreed with being able to use 'HALT' to assess their emotions.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For about a week, I was tracking my mood as part of a challenge from another app. Realized I started spiraling around 2:30 most days. Just needed food," one TikTok user pointed out. Another user added, "This has been such a powerful tool during my &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/things-therapist-recommends-start-feel-depressed"&gt;healing from depression and anxiety&lt;/a&gt;.

                    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. logged fewer than 20 measles cases this week, though Iowa announced the state’s first outbreak Thursday and Georgia confirmed its second Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been 1,214 confirmed measles cases this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. Health officials in Texas, where the nation’s biggest outbreak raged during the late winter and spring, confirmed six cases in the last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three other major outbreaks in North America. The longest, in Ontario, Canada, has resulted in &lt;a href="https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/Documents/M/24/measles-ontario-epi-summary.pdf?rev=3d8451977cd34084a8b494a6a11b4f1a&amp;amp;sc_lang=en&amp;amp;hash=48D1A6D0D037B39BD421AAF060204EE0"&gt;2,179 cases&lt;/a&gt; from mid-October through June 17. The province logged its first death June 5 in a baby who got congenital measles but also had other preexisting conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/diseases-know-no-borders-measles-spreads-with-outbreaks-in-canada-mexico-and-u-s"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; ‘Diseases know no borders’: Measles spreads with outbreaks in Canada, Mexico and U.S.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another outbreak in Alberta, Canada, has sickened &lt;a href="https://www.alberta.ca/measles"&gt;996 as of Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. And the Mexican state of Chihuahua had 2,335 measles cases and four deaths as of Friday, according to data from the state health ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other U.S. states with active outbreaks — which the CDC defines as three or more related cases — include Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, &lt;a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/aP4Au/?v=3"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota and Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., two elementary school-aged children in the epicenter in West Texas and an adult in New Mexico have died of measles this year. All were unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that’s airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through vaccines and has been considered eliminated from the U.S. since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many measles cases are there in Texas?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a total of 750 cases across &lt;a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/sxSwi/?v=7"&gt;35 counties, most of them in West Texas&lt;/a&gt;, state health officials said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the outbreak, 97 people have been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;State health officials estimated&lt;/a&gt; less than 1% of cases — fewer than 10 — are actively infectious. Fifty-five percent of Texas’ cases are in Gaines County, where the virus started spreading in a close-knit, undervaccinated Mennonite community. The county has had 413 cases since late January — just under 2% of its residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The April 3 death in Texas was an 8-year-old child, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Local health officials said the child did not have underlying health conditions and died of “what the child’s doctor described as measles pulmonary failure.” A unvaccinated child with no underlying conditions died of measles in Texas in late February; Kennedy said the child was 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many measles cases are there in New Mexico?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Mexico held steady Friday with a total of 81 cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven people have been hospitalized since the outbreak started. Most of the state’s cases are in Lea County. Sandoval County near Albuquerque has six cases, Eddy County has three, Doña Ana County has two. Chaves, Curry and San Juan counties have one each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unvaccinated adult died of measles-related illness March 6. The person did not seek medical care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Oklahoma?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oklahoma added one case Friday for a total of 17 confirmed and three probable cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state health department is not releasing which counties have cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Arizona?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arizona has four cases in Navajo County. They are linked to a single source, the county health department said June 9. All four were unvaccinated and had a history of recent international travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Colorado?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorado has seen a total of 16 measles cases in 2025, which includes one outbreak of 10 related cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak is linked to a Turkish Airlines flight that landed at Denver International Airport in mid-May. Four of the people were on the flight with the first case — an out-of-state traveler not included in the state count — while five got measles from exposure in the airport and one elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials are also tracking an unrelated case in a Boulder County resident. The person was fully vaccinated but had “recently traveled to Europe, where there are a large number of measles cases,” the state health department said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other counties that have seen measles this year include Archuleta and Pueblo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Georgia?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Georgia has an outbreak of three cases in metro Atlanta, with the most recent infection confirmed Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state has confirmed six total cases in 2025. The remaining three are part of an unrelated outbreak from January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Illinois?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illinois health officials confirmed a four-case outbreak on May 5 in the far southern part of the state. It grew to eight cases as of June 6, but no new cases were reported in the following weeks, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state’s other two cases so far this year were in Cook County, and are unrelated to the southern Illinois outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Iowa?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iowa has had six total measles cases in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four are part of an outbreak in eastern Johnson County, among members of the same household. County health officials said the people are isolating at home, so they don’t expect additional spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Kansas?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/aP4Au/?v=3"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; has a total of 79 cases across 11 counties in the southwestern part of the state, with three hospitalizations. All but three of the cases are connected, and most are in Gray County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Montana?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Montana had 22 measles cases as of Friday. Fourteen were in Gallatin County, which is where the first cases showed up — Montana’s first in 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flathead and Yellowstone counties had two cases each, and Hill County had four cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are outbreaks in neighboring North Dakota and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in North Dakota?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Dakota, which hadn’t seen measles since 2011, was up to 34 cases as of June 6, but has held steady since. Two of the people have been hospitalized. All of the people with confirmed cases were not vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 16 cases in Williams County in western North Dakota on the Montana border. On the eastern side of the state, there were 10 cases in Grand Forks County and seven cases in Cass County. Burke County, in northwest North Dakota on the border of Saskatchewan, Canada, had one case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;Where else is measles showing up in the U.S.?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles cases also have been reported this year in Alaska, Arkansas, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials declared earlier outbreaks in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania over after six weeks of no new cases. Tennessee’s outbreak also appears to be over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cases and outbreaks in the U.S. are frequently traced to someone who caught the disease abroad. The CDC said in May that more than twice as many measles have come from outside of the U.S. compared to May of last year. Most of those are in unvaccinated Americans returning home. In 2019, the U.S. saw 1,274 cases and almost lost its status of having eliminated measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;What do you need to know about the MMR vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid measles is to get the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html"&gt;measles, mumps and rubella&lt;/a&gt; vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting another MMR shot as an adult is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don’t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective vaccine made from “killed” virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who have documentation that they had measles are immune and those born before 1957 generally don’t need the shots because so many children got measles back then that they have “presumptive immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles has a harder time spreading through communities with high vaccination rates — above 95% — due to “herd immunity.” But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;What are the symptoms of measles?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;dangerous complications&lt;/a&gt; such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How can you treat measles?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;A dog in Raleigh is recovering after being bitten by a rabid
raccoon on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Animal Control was called to Windsor Trail in Raleigh on Thursday
after the dog had been bitten. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Wake County Public Health and Wake County Animal Control
confirmed on Friday the raccoon tested positive for rabies. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;According to county officials, the dog was up to date on its
rabies vaccination and received a booster after being bitten. It is expected to
be ok. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Rabies is a serious public health concern, and we’re
grateful that this pet was protected through vaccination,” said Wake County
Commissioner Tara Waters. “This incident is an important reminder of why it’s
so critical to keep your pets up to date on their rabies shots.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Anyone in the area who may have encountered a raccoon is asked to call the Wake County Communicable Disease line at 919-250-4462. If a person or their
pet may have been bitten or scratched, officials advise seeking medical
attention right away. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;County officials have provided a list of tips to help
minimize rabies risks:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/rabid-raccoon-bites-dog-raleigh-june-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/rabid-raccoon-bites-dog-raleigh-june-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not approach animals that you do not know. Exercise caution and maintain a safe distance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have been bitten or scratched by an animal of unknown vaccination history, wash the wound immediately and seek medical attention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make sure your pets have a current rabies vaccination. If your pet is allowed outside, a booster vaccine is strongly recommended. Keep outdoor pets indoors until they receive the booster vaccines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not feed stray or unknown animals, including cats and dogs. Avoid any interaction that may result in potential exposure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not leave trash or food outside unless it is in a trash can with a tight-fitting lid. Prevent attracting wild animals to your property.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a pet is fed outside, do not leave food out overnight to minimize the chances of attracting animals that may carry rabies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a pet comes in contact with an animal that might be rabid, contact a veterinarian immediately. Seek professional guidance to ensure the well-being of your pet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

By analyzing facial features during a foraging task in a virtual reality setup, researchers identified patterns linked to motivation, focus, and responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These patterns were consistent across species, suggesting a shared link between facial expression and cognition. If similar findings hold in humans, this method could revolutionize diagnostics in ADHD, autism, and dementia by objectively measuring attention and other mental states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-Species Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Facial expressions reflect similar internal cognitive states in both mice and macaques.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive Power:&lt;/strong&gt; Specific facial patterns can forecast how quickly and accurately animals complete tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may lead to new diagnostic tools for non-verbal conditions like autism, ADHD, or dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Max Planck Society&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whether you are solving a puzzle, navigating a shopping center or writing an email: How well you do will not only depend on the task at hand but also on your internal cognitive state.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Motivated, focused, restless, confident, or insecure?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, researchers at the Ernst Strüngmann Institute in Frankfurt have now shown that such cognitive states can be identified from facial expressions — and can even be used to accurately predict how quickly and successfully a task will be solved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111079"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc.jpg" alt="This shows a woman pulling different facial expressions." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The study thus also shows how facial expressions can be used as objective measures of internal states, allowing conclusions to be drawn about thought processes. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, this works across species – more specifically, macaques and mice. In both species, facial expressions not only express emotional states, but also latent cognitive processes in a measurable way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cognitive states are similar across species&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal behaviour, for example when searching for food, is largely influenced by internal cognitive states such as attention or motivation to find food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of the study was therefore to better describe functional aspects of cognitive processes and to analyze whether latent cognitive states are similar across species. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To this end, the researchers had macaques and mice perform a naturalistic foraging task in a specially developed virtual reality environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wide range of facial expressions were recorded, which were then used in a statistical model and further computer simulations to identify a series of latent states that accurately predict when the animals will respond to the stimuli shown and how well they will solve the search task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relationship between the identified states and task performance is comparable between species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Each cognitive state corresponds to a characteristic pattern of facial features that also overlaps between species,” said postdoctoral researcher Alejandro Tlaie Boria, first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;”This means that facial expressions can be considered a reliable manifestation of internal cognitive states even across species boundaries.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Facial expressions provide insight into thought processes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study thus also shows how facial expressions can be used as objective measures of internal states, allowing conclusions to be drawn about thought processes. This is already directly relevant for research on animal models and could represent a breakthrough for comparative neuroscience and behavioral research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Chances for ADHD, autism, and dementia research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether the results can be transferred to human facial expressions remains to be investigated. However, if they are confirmed for humans, the findings could become relevant for applications in psychiatry and in autism and dementia research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approaches could be used to recognize latent cognitive states in non-verbal individuals, such as in cases of autism or locked-in syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The objective measurement of attention states also offers significant potential for improvement in ADHD diagnostics, for example to quantify severity or to identify specific cognitive patterns that can be assigned to ADHD subtypes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this facial expression and cognitive state research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Andrea Knierriem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Max Planck Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Andrea Knierriem – Max Planck Society&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-60296-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Inferring internal states across mice and monkeys using facial features&lt;/a&gt;” by Alejandro Tlaie Boria et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inferring internal states across mice and monkeys using facial features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal behaviour is shaped to a large degree by internal cognitive states, but it is unknown whether these states are similar across species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this question, here we develop a virtual reality setup in which male mice and macaques engage in the same naturalistic visual foraging task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We exploit the richness of a wide range of facial features extracted from video recordings during the task, to train a Markov-Switching Linear Regression (MSLR).

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise releases a protein called CLCF1 that acts like an anti-aging molecule for muscles and bones&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;CLCF1 levels naturally decline with age, but resistance training and high-intensity exercise can restore them&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;When scientists blocked this protein in mice, exercise lost most of its muscle and bone strengthening benefits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DAEJEON, South Korea —&lt;/strong&gt; There may really be no better “fountain of youth” remedy than a good old-fashioned workout. Research out of South Korea reveals that when you exercise, your muscles release a powerful protein that acts like a biological time machine, potentially reversing age-related decline in both muscle and bone strength.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists have identified that the molecule &lt;em&gt;cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1&lt;/em&gt; (CLCF1) surges through the bloodstream during workouts, particularly resistance training. This protein appears to reverse some aspects of age-related decline. The discovery could explain why some 80-year-olds can outperform sedentary 40-year-olds, and it might lead to new treatments for age-related &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/muscle-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscle loss&lt;/a&gt; and osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59959-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, shows that CLCF1 levels naturally decline as we age, but exercise can restore them to youthful levels. When researchers gave this protein to elderly mice, the animals regained muscle strength and bone density that rivaled much younger mice. Even more striking: when scientists blocked the protein’s activity, exercise lost most of its &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/anti-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anti-aging benefits.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-your-muscles-talk-to-your-bones-during-exercise"&gt;How Your Muscles Talk to Your Bones During Exercise&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CLCF1 belongs to a family of proteins called &lt;em&gt;myokines&lt;/em&gt;, which are chemical messengers that muscles release during physical activity. Myokines act like your muscle’s way of sending text messages to the rest of your body about what’s happening during exercise. Some messages tell fat cells to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/morning-exercise-burning-calories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;burn more energy&lt;/a&gt;, others instruct bones to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/lifting-weights-vegans-bones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;get stronger&lt;/a&gt;, and some even reach your brain to improve mood and memory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CLCF1 appears especially important because it targets both muscle and bone simultaneously. As we age, both tissues typically weaken together, a process that can lead to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/frailty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;frailty&lt;/a&gt;, falls, and fractures. One molecule addressing both problems makes it particularly intriguing from a treatment standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by scientists in South Korea, first discovered CLCF1’s importance by analyzing gene activity in muscle samples from people of different ages before and after exercise training. They found that while young people naturally produced plenty of CLCF1 during workouts, older adults made much less of it. Declining CLCF1 levels might be a key reason why exercise becomes less effective at maintaining muscle and bone health as we age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-laboratory-studies-show-dramatic-results"&gt;Laboratory Studies Show Dramatic Results&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To test their theory, researchers conducted experiments with both cells in laboratory dishes and live mice. They treated muscle cells with CLCF1 and found that the protein supercharged the cells’ energy production, particularly their ability to burn glucose for fuel. Aging muscles often struggle to efficiently use energy, contributing to weakness and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the team gave CLCF1 injections to 20-month-old mice (roughly equivalent to 80-year-old humans), the results were dramatic. After just two weeks of treatment, the elderly mice showed significant improvements in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/grip-strength/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;grip strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/2d4d-ring-finger-length-endurance-running/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;running endurance&lt;/a&gt;. Their muscle fibers grew larger, and their bones became denser and stronger.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Muscle analysis revealed that CLCF1 activated several important cellular pathways involved in muscle growth and energy production. The protein particularly boosted glycolysis, which is the process cells use to quickly generate energy from sugar. This helps explain why CLCF1 might be especially important during high-intensity exercise, when muscles need rapid bursts of energy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CLCF1 also proved to be a powerful &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/prunes-keeps-bone-disease-away/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bone medicine&lt;/a&gt;. The protein worked by suppressing osteoclasts (cells that break down old bone tissue) while promoting osteoblasts, the cells that build new bone. This dual action led to increased bone volume and thickness in the treated mice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-engineered-mice-reveal-exercise-s-secret"&gt;Engineered Mice Reveal Exercise’s Secret&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other experiments, researchers created mice that overproduced CLCF1 throughout their lives. These mice showed enhanced muscle function and stronger bones even without extra exercise. They had better grip strength, could hang from grids longer, and ran farther on treadmills compared to normal mice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers also conducted the opposite experiment: they blocked CLCF1 activity in mice during exercise training. When they gave mice a protein called &lt;em&gt;eCNTFR&lt;/em&gt; that neutralizes CLCF1, exercise lost most of its beneficial effects on both muscle and bone. The mice could still run on treadmills, but they didn’t gain the usual improvements in strength, endurance, or bone density.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Simply put, CLCF1 is actually doing much of the heavy lifting when it comes to exercise’s anti-aging benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mouse studies were impressive, but do these results apply to humans? The researchers examined blood samples from people of various ages and exercise habits to find out. They discovered that circulating CLCF1 levels naturally decline with age in humans, just as they do in mice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, exercise could reverse this decline. When young adults performed resistance training or &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/hiit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;high-intensity interval workouts&lt;/a&gt;, their blood CLCF1 levels increased significantly. Older adults who participated in 12-16 week resistance training programs also saw their CLCF1 levels rise, though the response was somewhat reduced compared to younger people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Different types of exercise produced different responses. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/resistance-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Resistance training&lt;/a&gt; and high-intensity intervals boosted CLCF1 levels, but moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (like casual treadmill walking) did not. CLCF1 release might require a certain threshold of exercise intensity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While these results are exciting, several important limitations should be noted. The human studies involved relatively small groups of participants, and the researchers acknowledge that their human data should be considered “exploratory” and require further investigation. Most of the dramatic &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/anti-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anti-aging effects&lt;/a&gt; were demonstrated in mice, not humans. While mice are excellent models for studying basic biological processes, findings don’t always translate perfectly to humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While we’re still years away from CLCF1-based therapies, these results reinforce the profound importance of staying physically active throughout life. They suggest that resistance training and high-intensity exercise might be particularly powerful tools &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;for healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;. For now, the best way to boost your CLCF1 levels is the old-fashioned way: hit the weights, push your limits, and let your muscles work their molecular magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed gene expression data from human muscle samples before and after exercise to identify age-related changes in myokine production. They then conducted laboratory experiments with mouse muscle cells and performed multiple studies with young (3-month-old) and aged (18-24-month-old) mice. Some mice received CLCF1 injections, others had the protein’s activity blocked, and some were genetically modified to overproduce CLCF1. The team measured muscle strength through grip tests and treadmill running, analyzed muscle fiber size through microscopic examination, and assessed bone density using micro-CT scanning. They also collected blood samples from human participants of various ages before and after different exercise programs to measure circulating CLCF1 levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CLCF1 levels naturally decline with age in both humans and mice, but exercise training can restore them. In aged mice, CLCF1 treatment improved grip strength, running endurance, muscle fiber size, and bone density. The protein enhanced cellular energy production, particularly glucose metabolism, and activated pathways involved in muscle growth. For bones, CLCF1 suppressed bone-destroying cells while promoting bone-building cells. Mice genetically engineered to overproduce CLCF1 showed enhanced physical performance, while blocking CLCF1 activity eliminated most of exercise’s beneficial effects. In humans, resistance training and high-intensity exercise increased blood CLCF1 levels, but moderate aerobic exercise did not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The human studies involved relatively small sample sizes and should be considered exploratory. Most dramatic anti-aging effects were demonstrated in mice, and findings may not fully translate to humans. The research focused primarily on resistance and high-intensity exercise, leaving questions about other forms of physical activity. Some human cohort baseline CLCF1 levels varied significantly between groups, particularly in elite athletes, which may have influenced results. The muscle-specific knockout experiments showed less pronounced effects than expected, suggesting other cell types may also contribute to CLCF1 production during exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

(WHAM) — &lt;a href="https://townandcountrysolutions.com/" target="_blank" title="https://townandcountrysolutions.com/" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Town &amp;amp; Country Pest Solutions&lt;/a&gt; has been helping people locally and across the state get rid of pests for the last 40 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rats in general are horrible all over Rochester," said Caleb Fabry, the company's president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fabry said Town &amp;amp; Country's phones have been ringing nonstop for the last six months, with some of the worst infestations he's ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ten years ago, we would get calls, but it was here and there," he said. "(Now) we're seeing them every day. We're seeing some of the worst infestations we've ever seen in the Rochester area. I would say that it's aligning with what you would expect in a bigger city like New York City and things like that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, the pest control company went out to a home in Gates whose owner had to be removed due to the condition of her home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a really sad situation," Fabry said. "She was living there last week, and her mattress is on the floor. She's an elderly lady."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fabry said the home was littered with urine and feces from pests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We go in there to evaluate how we can stop it, and there's rats everywhere," Fabry continued. "I'm telling you, she was just sleeping in this house a prior week. Rats everywhere. There was a chicken running around in the house. That story is, I want to say it's unusual, but we're seeing more like that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fabry said not only do rodents cause damage to property, but they can also carry diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've recently heard some famous people down in New Mexico died of hantavirus, and it is from rats and mice, and it's the viruses that they spread, and these things are real and that’s what pest control does," he said. "We're in charge of public health, and in so many ways, but you have to take it serious and just us coming in and trapping and giving you all the good ideas doesn't solve it. You have to do something, too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>13wham.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 21:05:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi6wFBVV95cUxNSzU0Rm9CRDFZb1NsS1RZVWxjdDFZMmdRWGFSSksyM3phQUtPcENyUU04ZDktYWttRW5DS0EyOG01NkNSS1hZeEw4eVI0dHVpMHZCX3BPY1JpbmxrdUE2SlFodEtvVl8zUGFkTW5OVF9URUwxbzZ6QlYySkRpaHVHNmxWZ184ZWFGRHlQNDFsOVhyWDk4OEZGTVZSaGFnbEFZMlpwWkY2WUdPRVBBSVFGNW1xQnNUZkxIcjJYMkFhYTdtZUZYWVZxUS1wSk5qYVlPZ3k0Ml8yT1VCS2JULTNmeERpZF90YWlqdU1V</guid></item><item><title>患有自闭症的两个儿子的妈妈在患有食肉病后截肢： “我无法照顾我的孩子” - AOL.com | Mom of 2 Sons with Autism Has Limbs Amputated After Flesh-Eating Disease: 'I Can't Take Care of My Children’ - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiakFVX3lxTE4xNnBNRWE4eVVWdHNMMU12UXF1VUxlUE1SYmNiMm1oQldtem0zNlM3d3Y1eElXSGltNS11U0lOX0ZMaVlHdE9yUDZLZFZVNHNTRXk2ZnJJWEkzemh4ajhTNVFidE5RdFl0SlE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;gofundme&lt;/p&gt; Arisbeth Muñoz is raising money for prosthetics after having three limbs and part of her hand amputated.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NEED TO KNOW&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arisbeth Muñoz, 39, was diagnosed in December with the flu and strep A, which triggered a life-threatening infection that lasted months&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Muñoz developed necrotizing fasciitis, doctors amputated her legs below the knees, her right arm, and part of her left hand to stop the spread of the infection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mom of two boys who have autism is raising money for prosthetics so she can support her sons at their school meetings, and says “I’m grateful because I’m alive and I can stay with my kids"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 39-year-old mom of two is raising money for prosthetics after having her legs, right arm, and part of her left hand &lt;a href="https://people.com/hiker-burn-camping-skillet-sepsis-double-amputation-exclusive-8779198" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:amputated;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;amputated&lt;/a&gt;, the result of a deadly infection triggered by the flu and strep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arisbeth Muñoz, who lives in San Diego, went to the emergency room last December 28 when she began vomiting and experienced pain in her side. There, tests confirmed she had the &lt;a href="https://people.com/flu-complications-girl-4-goes-into-cardiac-arrest-11689798" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:flu;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://people.com/woman-raises-awareness-for-invasive-strep-a-after-losing-her-3-year-old-daughter-to-the-disease-8764263" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Group A;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Group A &lt;/a&gt;strep — common infections that can be treated with antibiotics and over-the-counter remedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But from that point, her condition rapidly deteriorated. Muñoz shared in a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-arisbeth-munoz-walk-again-fund-prosthetics" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoFundMe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt;: “Having been perfectly fine that morning, my body was now in a state of sepsis,” a life-threatening infection that can occur when the body improperly responds to an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;gofundme&lt;/p&gt; Arisbeth Muñoz is raising money for prosthetics after having three limbs and part of her hand amputated.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The doctors [said] that I will pass away that night,” she told &lt;a href="https://www.10news.com/news/local-news/logan-heights-mom-survives-flesh-eating-infection-faces-life-with-amputations" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ABC News 10;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ABC News 10&lt;/a&gt;, sharing that she was placed in a medically induced coma until February. Her condition continued to decline. Muñoz had a heart attack, struggled with an internal hemorrhage, and developed &lt;a href="https://people.com/flesh-eating-bacteria-survivor-finds-new-purpose-outdoors-8659463" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:necrotizing fasciitis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;necrotizing fasciitis&lt;/a&gt; — commonly called the flesh-eating bacteria — which resulted in the amputation of her legs under the knee, her right arm, and part of her left hand, to stop the infection’s spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I saw my arms and legs: darkness. I think it's a bad dream," Muñoz said. She spent months in the hospital and was finally discharged in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's difficult. It’s changed my life. I can't take care of my children 100%," Muñoz told ABC. As she shared in the GoFundMe, she now desperately needs prosthetics to properly look after “my two sons, Matthew and Enrique, who are autistic and who have relied heavily on me in terms of care, as well as to be present at their therapy, evaluation and medical appointments. Now, during this trying time, I desire nothing more than to continue to care for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, she's managing as best as she can, she told ABC: "I can eat [by] myself and brush my teeth by myself," Muñoz said. “I can push myself out of the bed on my side.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as she shared, “I’m grateful because I’m alive and I can stay with my kids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/mom-amputation-flesh-eating-disease-two-sons-autism-11758481" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 20:55:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE4xNnBNRWE4eVVWdHNMMU12UXF1VUxlUE1SYmNiMm1oQldtem0zNlM3d3Y1eElXSGltNS11U0lOX0ZMaVlHdE9yUDZLZFZVNHNTRXk2ZnJJWEkzemh4ajhTNVFidE5RdFl0SlE</guid></item><item><title>科学家表示，性药物伟哥具有令人惊讶的新健康益处，可以帮助300万英国老年人- the-sun.com | Sex drug Viagra has surprising new health benefit and could help 3 million ageing Brits, say scientists - the-sun.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxPRlEzbENPUE5Dc0NoS3NSV2pWVENmWXZ3SjZDZDlzRXFNVDBObzNRU1VpYkNaZnBuYmxBaHV2cjBtM0xtQXJmZWhuQmVoYU0tWW9TNEdxZ1c3dFRKLW1mUU9weW96YzFhTHc3WnFvMkZZc2ZaMnFWRGVQcmxaX1R0MA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEX aid pill Viagra helps stiffen your skeleton, a study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The little blue tablet was found to increase production of vital bone cells — so could one day prevent back pain and fractures in old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-container-placeholder lazyload" data-name="news" data-value="The US Sun" data-login-link="https://login.the-sun.com" data-isgeneric="true" data-widget-name="newsletter"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found sildenafil, which is branded as &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/health/11921920/record-amounts-viagra-prescribed-nhs/" rel=""&gt;Viagra&lt;/a&gt;, helped human stem cells transform into osteoblasts, the bone-building cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are vital as the human skeleton regenerates and is completely replaced roughly once every ten years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we age, we lose more bone than we build, increasing the risk of breaks or osteoporosis, which makes bones brittle and painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Peking University team’s follow-up tests on mice also suggested sildenafil would prevent bone loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Menglong Hu and Dr Likun Wu said: “Our findings offer new insights into the physiological effects of the medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sildenafil enhanced stem cell osteogenic differentiation and inhibited bone loss ­— it may usefully treat osteoporosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than three million Britons suffer &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/health/13791645/how-to-protect-bones-osteoporosis-fractures/" rel=""&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;.

In acute pain, neurons in the medullary dorsal horn reduce their activity through a natural “braking” system involving A-type potassium currents, helping limit pain signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in chronic pain, this mechanism fails, and the neurons become overactive, continuing to send pain messages. This discovery provides a clearer biological pathway for how pain becomes chronic and may guide future therapies aimed at restoring this internal regulation system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brainstem Relay Dysfunction:&lt;/strong&gt; In chronic pain, neurons in the medullary dorsal horn lose their ability to dampen pain signals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A-Type Potassium Current (IA):&lt;/strong&gt; This current acts as a brake in acute pain but fails to activate in chronic pain conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Implication:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting IA could be a novel strategy to prevent or treat chronic pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Hebrew University of Jerusalem&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does some pain go away while other types linger, turning into chronic suffering? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking study from scientists at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem may have uncovered part of the answer — deep inside the brainstem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111075"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In acute pain, IA increases — acting like a natural sedative for the pain pathways. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published this week in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, researchers led by Doctoral student Ben Title under the guidance of Prof. Alexander M. Binshtok from The Hebrew University-Hadassah School of Medicine and the Center for Brain Sciences (ELSC) at The Hebrew University, reveal that our bodies respond to acute (short-term) and chronic (long-lasting) pain in surprisingly different ways at the cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their discovery sheds new light on how pain becomes chronic — and opens the door to better-targeted treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Brain’s “Pain Relays” Behave Differently in Acute vs. Chronic Pain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The team studied a small but crucial region in the brainstem called the medullary dorsal horn, home to neurons that act as a relay station for pain signals. These projection neurons help send pain messages from the body to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that during acute inflammatory pain, these neurons actually dial down their own activity. This built-in “braking system” helps limit the amount of pain-related signals sent to the brain. Once the inflammation and pain subside, the neurons return to their normal state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in chronic pain, this braking system fails. The neurons don’t reduce their activity — in fact, they become more excitable and fire more signals, potentially contributing to the persistence of pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Key Player: A-Type Potassium Current&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a combination of electrophysiology and computer modeling, the researchers identified a key mechanism: a specific potassium current known as the A-type potassium current (IA). This current helps regulate the excitability of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In acute pain, IA increases — acting like a natural sedative for the pain pathways. But in chronic pain, this current doesn’t ramp up, and the neurons become hyperactive. The absence of this regulation may be one of the biological switches that turns temporary pain into a long-lasting condition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for Chronic Pain Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first time we’ve seen how the same neurons behave so differently in acute versus chronic pain,” said Prof. Binshtok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that this natural ‘calming’ mechanism is missing in chronic pain suggests a new target for therapy. If we can find a way to restore or mimic that braking system, we might be able to prevent pain from becoming chronic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Step Toward Smarter Pain Therapies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic pain affects over 50 million people in the U.S. alone, often with few effective treatment options. This new study adds an important piece to the puzzle by showing how the nervous system’s built-in pain controls are disrupted in long-term pain conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By understanding the brain’s own strategies for limiting pain — and why they sometimes fail — scientists are now one step closer to developing smarter, more precise therapies for those who suffer from chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this pain and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8eeaefe0efebe3edcefdeff8e7e1e0a0e6fbe4e7a0efeda0e7e2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Danae Marx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://huji.ac.il" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hebrew University of Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Danae Marx – Hebrew University of Jerusalem&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adr3467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Opposite regulation of medullary pain-related projection neuron excitability in acute and chronic pain&lt;/a&gt;” by Alexander M.

(WPBN/WGTU) -- A second confirmed case of measles was announced Friday, two days after the first case was confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Grand Traverse County Health Department (GTCHD) said the second case of measles is linked to the &lt;a href="https://upnorthlive.com/news/local/measles-case-confirmed-in-grand-traverse-county-first-since-2019-no-public-exposure-yet#" target="_blank" title="https://upnorthlive.com/news/local/measles-case-confirmed-in-grand-traverse-county-first-since-2019-no-public-exposure-yet#" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;first confirmed case&lt;/a&gt;, identified on June 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious virus that can remain infectious in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals who were present at the following locations may have been exposed and should monitor for symptoms for 21 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chelsea Park West Apartment Complex – Located off of Hartman Rd in Traverse City, MI, Wednesday, June 4th through Friday, June 13th&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Walmart Super Center – 2640 Crossing Cir., Traverse City, MI 49684, Saturday, June 14th from 12:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles usually begin 7-14 days after exposure, but can appear up to 21 days after exposure and may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever (may spike to over 104F).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tiny white spots on the inner cheeks, gums, and roof of the mouth (Koplik Spots) may appear two to three days after symptoms begin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rash that is red, raised, blotchy; usually starts on the face, spreads to trunk, arms, and legs three to five days after symptoms begin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone experiencing symptoms is urged to call their healthcare provider. If seeking in-person medical attention, call ahead to inform your doctor, urgent care, or emergency room of the potential measles exposure before arrival so facilities may take precautions to prevent exposure to other individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, if it has been less than six days since the potential exposure, you may be able to receive post-exposure treatment that could prevent illness. Contact your healthcare provider, pharmacy, or local health department for vaccination and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GTCHD has a measles hotline that can be reached during normal business hours, Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at 231-995-6800. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the line will be monitored from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Saturday, June 21st, and from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Sunday, June 22nd.  If outside of office hours, Grand Traverse County residents can also contact 2-1-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Disease investigations performed by our local health department are critical to ensuring we can limit the impact of diseases such as measles in our community,” said Mike Lahey, Health Officer at GTCHD. "It is important to consider staying up-to-date on all routine vaccinations, including the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, to prevent the spread of severe illness and disease."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WPBN</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 20:15:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxNRjk0N1BvLTNRekJxNHpWbE1BVkhVQkVEMVRjLWxyWl9VbklRLThqcVVqOGpNdmFMVW5FOTFtdnlKa1NCTTFuNWw2U05ac29UU0ljVnBqZ19GOTljc3YyREQ3Sm1UMVU1Vkpxekk2UGVOdHJ0bE9MdEFNQXNxcnRmNVhmakVCM1REX204SkV1WkpPdG1TLUxBcGFxbHFOZ0hvcExDMUF3TDVCaU1MUHNJMXFFb0lvUFFVVTl4cw</guid></item><item><title>犹他县多年来首例麻疹病例报告- KSL新闻 | Utah's first measles case in years reported in Utah County - KSL News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxOM2oxcTFXUjhJZnNLR2xrUFVZUWhjci1vZ3o3WVI4SWZ0d2ptdnJiSWtVeGF4T0ZGUmVaNGVmR0d6SVp4NFRnaENOUzhyZk5kZWdtMmRTVjVDZllEclFjN1VhQTBXYW55Zjk0Q2Q1LWZDY2pQeVhTejJRcWd2WVZoczMxVlhMT01mdzh4U0t2cmdwVllzUklZNUFB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY – Utah public health officials announced the first case of measles to originate in the state in at least two years, urging those who may have come in contact with the person to watch closely for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a release, the Utah Department of Health and Human Services said it has "identified an adult from Utah County who has been diagnosed with measles." On Friday, Dr. Leisha Nolen, state epidemiologist, said the person is between 20 and 40 years old, she but did not identify the individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department said the person was unvaccinated "and has no out-of-state exposures, which indicates the infection was transmitted within Utah." The release stated that the department had identified anyone else with measles as of Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ksl-article-content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department said during thier "infectious period but prior to diagnosis," the person visited "several" public places. This included the Timpanogos Regional Emergency Room on June 14 between 2:14 p.m. and 7:02 p.m., and the Parkway Health Center in Orem on June 13, though no specific time was immediately known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nolen said the individual visited healthcare providers due to measles symptoms and was advised to stay home to quarantine, which they reportedly did following their diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People who were at these sites at the same time or two hours after this person could have been exposed to measles," the department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials urged those who may have crossed paths with the infected Utah County resident, especially those who are unvaccinated, to watch for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do have to suspect there are additional measles cases in Utah," Nolen said, noting the affected individual had not traveled outside of the state, pointing to the disease originating from Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have not been able to identify how that happened, so certainly there is some person who was able to transmit the virus to this individual. So we do think there are additional cases," Nolen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Related:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Measles symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department said measles symptoms appear seven to 14 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People who have a high fever (higher than 102.2°F or 39°C) and a cough, runny nose or red eyes may have early stages of measles," the department said. "A rash will usually appear after four days of fever."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rash, usually showing up first at the hairline then spreading down a person's body, is described as one of the main identifying signs of measles, Nolen said in a press conference Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department noted that a person with measles can spread the disease before symptoms occur. Health officials urged those who develop symptoms to steer clear of others and call their health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Call first before you go to a clinic or hospital to prevent other people from exposure," the department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the department, over "90% of Utahns have been vaccinated against measles and are highly protected against infection." The department noted that infants under 1 year old cannot get the vaccine, meaning they are not protected from measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nolen recommended people speak with their clinicians to track down what vaccines they've had and learn more about an option to get an antibody test that will show if antibodies are present. Nolen noted there is no danger in having additional doses of the vaccination. It is recommended that people get two doses of the vaccine to make sure they are fully protected, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Public health in Utah wants to reassure the community that immediate action is being taken to contain the situation," the department said. "We encourage those who are not vaccinated to talk to their doctor about receiving the vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nolen said in the press conference that the last case of measles in Utah occurred two years ago, "in an international traveler."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on measles, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story may be updated&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL News</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 20:12:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOM2oxcTFXUjhJZnNLR2xrUFVZUWhjci1vZ3o3WVI4SWZ0d2ptdnJiSWtVeGF4T0ZGUmVaNGVmR0d6SVp4NFRnaENOUzhyZk5kZWdtMmRTVjVDZllEclFjN1VhQTBXYW55Zjk0Q2Q1LWZDY2pQeVhTejJRcWd2WVZoczMxVlhMT01mdzh4U0t2cmdwVllzUklZNUFB</guid></item><item><title>高胆固醇药物作为“靶向痴呆症”的突破- Surrey Live | High cholesterol drug breakthrough as 'targets dementia' - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxQU1hyMldwal9OSUZfUUdHd3BNdVRsOXozd2tTODhRRi1rMnI1Q00wWUZkZ0dqbXVBQkhfWWdCMkNWNXFqRVd2akZ1S3JmWlZlckx4Z1o0cmhZdmtjRER4emJuYUZKT0VQRlZSSE9qZF9FWk40R0g5SU9JYVFYcThBc1RtT29LazNXQUp5eTdjZTV6QUxuOFE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol-lowering drugs have been associated with a decreased risk of dementia, according to a recent study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Statins, one of the most frequently prescribed medications in the UK, are taken by approximately seven to eight million people to reduce their likelihood of heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New research now suggests they may offer additional benefits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study found that individuals with low levels of "bad" cholesterol in their blood have a lower risk of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the use of statins was found to provide "additional protective effects".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Statins are a group of drugs that can help decrease the amount of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Often referred to as "bad cholesterol", LDL cholesterol (LDL- C) can lead to plaque build-up in arteries, resulting in cardiovascular disease, which increases the risk of strokes, heart attacks and death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;South Korean researchers stated that their findings "underscore the crucial role of managing LDL- C in lowering dementia risk".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study analysed health data from over 570,000 individuals in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; recommends aiming for bad cholesterol levels in the blood to be below 4mmol/L (millimoles per litre).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers discovered that individuals with LDL cholesterol levels below 1.8 mmol/L had a 26% lower risk of dementia and a 28% reduced risk of Alzheimer's compared to those with LDL cholesterol levels above 3.4 mmol/L.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Statin use appeared to offer additional protection against dementia when LDL cholesterol levels were low.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among individuals with LDL cholesterol levels below 1.8 mmol/L, statin use was associated with a 13% reduction in dementia risk and a 12% decrease in the risk of Alzheimer's disease compared to non-users.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"These findings emphasise the importance of targeted LDL- C management as part of dementia prevention strategies, with potential integration into clinical guidelines," the authors penned in the Journal of Neurology Neurosurgery and Psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The results support the use of statin therapy within specific LDL- C ranges for both cardiovascular and cognitive health benefits."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They added: "This insightful understanding of how statin use interacts with LDL- C levels emphasises the need for personalised statin prescriptions, focusing on achieving LDL- C levels that offer the maximum cognitive benefits."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Commenting on the study, Dr Julia Dudley, head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: "This large study looked at patient records for levels of LDL cholesterol and the risk of dementia, it also examined those patients who were on statins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"It found that those people with lower LDL levels had a reduced risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The use of statins seemed to offer a protective effect – even in those who already had cholesterol levels within a lower range.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"However, dementia risk is complex and influenced by many factors. Without a detailed picture of what's going on in the brain we do not know if there is a direct link between lower cholesterol and reduced dementia risk. Clinical trials will be key to understand what effects statins might be having on disease processes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"In the meantime, keeping our hearts healthy remains one of the most effective ways we can protect our brain health. If you have any concerns about your cholesterol levels, you should speak to your GP."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Richard Oakley from the Alzheimer's Society added: "Dementia risk is complicated and determined by several factors including genetics, lifestyle, and the environment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"This study adds to our understanding by showing the strong connection between heart and brain health. Simply put, what is good for the heart is good for the head."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He further stated: "This is an ever-evolving topic, and more targeted research and trials are needed to understand whether statins can help protect the brain. However, it is crucial to talk to your GP before making any changes to your medication".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 19:55:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxQU1hyMldwal9OSUZfUUdHd3BNdVRsOXozd2tTODhRRi1rMnI1Q00wWUZkZ0dqbXVBQkhfWWdCMkNWNXFqRVd2akZ1S3JmWlZlckx4Z1o0cmhZdmtjRER4emJuYUZKT0VQRlZSSE9qZF9FWk40R0g5SU9JYVFYcThBc1RtT29LazNXQUp5eTdjZTV6QUxuOFE</guid></item><item><title>犹他州报告了首例麻疹病例。以下是您需要了解的信息。-《盐湖论坛报》 | Utah reports its first measles case.

The person, who was not further identified, is unvaccinated and had no out-of-state exposures, indicating the infection was transmitted within Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-element"&gt;&lt;div class="image-rootCenter"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1ez1ofp"&gt;&lt;span class=" lazy-load-image-background "&gt;&lt;span class="image-img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="caption-credit"&gt;(Francisco Kjolseth  | The Salt Lake Tribune) Public health officials warn of the first verified case of measles in Utah as Dr. Leisha Nolen, state epidemiologist, gives an update on a adult from Utah County diagnosed with the highly contagious disease on Friday, June 20, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;At a press conference Friday, state epidemiologist Dr. Leisha Nolen said officials have not yet identified the source of the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“We do think there are additional cases,” Nolen said. “At this time, we have not identified others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Nolen said the infected person is isolating at home with minimal contact. The Utah County Health Department has been working closely with the person and their family, she said, advising exposed relatives to monitor symptoms and stay home to prevent further spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Before their diagnosis, the Utah County resident visited several public places during their infectious period, health officials said. People who were at those sites during or two hours after that person may have been exposed to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Two of those locations were:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt; • &lt;b&gt;The Parkway Health Center&lt;/b&gt;, 145 W. 1300 South, Orem, sometime on June 13. Health officials are trying to confirm a specific time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt; • &lt;b&gt;Timpanogos Regional ER&lt;/b&gt;, 750 W. 800 North, Orem, June 14, between 2:14 and 7:02 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;DHHS is urging people who were in those locations at those times to monitor themselves for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Measles symptoms typically appear seven to 14 days after exposure. They include a high fever — above 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit — and a cough, runny nose, or red eyes. A rash will usually appear within four days of a fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“The rash is really what hints to us that this is measles,” Nolen said, noting that it typically begins at the hairline and spreads down the body. “It can take up to three weeks from being exposed to actually start to have the symptoms, but usually it’s about 10 days.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;If you develop symptoms, stay away from other people and call your health care provider, health officials say. Call before going to a clinic or hospital, so staff there can prevent other people from exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;As of Thursday, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported&lt;/a&gt; a total of 1,214 confirmed measles cases in 34 states and the District of Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;In early June, &lt;a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/06/04/utah-officials-warn-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/06/04/utah-officials-warn-potential/"&gt;DHHS reported&lt;/a&gt; that an infected out-of-state person traveled through Utah’s Washington County, visiting family in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;According to DHHS, more than 90% of Utahns have been vaccinated against measles, and are well protected against infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, or MMR, Nolen said, “make you 97% sure that you will not get the infection. … And even if you do get the infection after that vaccine, it’s going to be much more mild than if you don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;There are exceptions, though: Infants younger than 1 year old, for example, are not eligible for the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Public health officials urge Utahns to check their immunization and medical records, or talk to a health care provider to see whether they were protected against measles. That’s especially true for people who are planning to travel outside the state or the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“It’s important to recognize that this is a controllable outbreak,” Nolen said, stressing the critical role of vaccination in reducing the risk of infection. “Unfortunately, measles does cause really severe disease, so one in 20 kids will go into the hospital, and that’s really significant. We also know kids can die of this. We’ve already had three deaths in the United States. We don’t want any more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Salt Lake Tribune</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 19:01:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE4tMlNCcVBwVzRJV0tIY3UxN3dIZDhFb0RBVnViUGd3THlzNnl2bkU2akJMLTRuX3V0cE1PdGoyUEFiVEloaTNTbEthaGhlSm9Td1RhWWNJZEtyWVU4WjVnSEx4RUJ4VUQ4SHNSN193RmpJMnFIdHlYdzhpbw</guid></item><item><title>在中国飙升的新型冠状病毒变种已抵达美国。以下是关于Nimbus的注意事项- AOL.com | The new coronavirus variant surging in China has arrived in the US.

Experts in Europe are &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/slow-increases-covid-19-observed-across-eueea-new-variant-emerges" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:predicting;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;predicting&lt;/a&gt; a possible increase in cases there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A summer wave also could occur in the United States. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, NB.1.8.1 already represents &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:about one-third;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;about one-third&lt;/a&gt; of new Covid-19 cases as of June 7. This is a significant increase from just a month before, when the new variant represented just 5% of new Covid-19 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could another summer wave really occur? Do current vaccines still work, and if so, who should consider getting another dose now? And what precautions should people take to reduce their risk of contracting Covid-19?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. Wen previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: What should people know about the new variant?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The SARS-CoV-2 virus is constantly mutating, and it’s entirely expected that there will be new variants. The more opportunities the virus is given to spread, the more opportunities it has to mutate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time a new variant arises that appears to be outcompeting previous strains, it’s important to ask three questions: Is it causing more severe disease, is it more contagious, and do existing vaccines still work against it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new variant, NB.1.8.1, also called Nimbus, is a descendant of the Omicron strain. The &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:World Health Organization;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; has deemed the new strain a “variant under monitoring.” However, WHO also reports that surveillance data do not show that it has increased severity compared with previously circulating variants. Given that this strain is outcompeting previous variants, it’s possible that it could be more contagious, but there is nothing to suggest that it is being spread differently compared with past variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for whether existing vaccines work against this variant, the answer is not known. WHO &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cites laboratory data;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cites laboratory data&lt;/a&gt; showing that it could have some immune escape, which means it may be less responsive to the immunity provided by vaccines or prior infection and suggesting a possible reduction in vaccine efficacy. At the same time, NB.1.8.1 is a close descendant of other strains against which the vaccines have efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I expect there will be more data available in the coming weeks, as federal health officials will soon decide the &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/fda-vaccine-advisers-recommend-sticking-jn1-strain-next-covid-vaccines" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:formulation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;formulation&lt;/a&gt; of this fall’s updated Covid-19 vaccine. Knowing that NB.1.8.1 constitutes a growing proportion of cases, they will most likely try to ensure that the formulation has efficacy again this variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: What are symptoms of N.B.1.8.1 infection?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The symptoms appear to be similar to infection with other variants. There is a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/signs-symptoms/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:large range of symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;large range of symptoms&lt;/a&gt; and severity. Some patients may have allergy-like symptoms, such as stuffy and runny nose. Others may have cold- or flulike symptoms, with fever, sore throat, fatigue, headache and muscle or body aches. Some people may develop cough and difficulty breathing. Some may have nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most people will recover, some could become severely ill and require hospitalization. Some individuals who contract Covid-19 may also develop the post-viral condition known as long Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: Could another summer wave really happen again?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. It could be triggered by a new variant that’s more contagious and that has some degree of immune escape. A wave also could occur simply because of declining population immunity. Some experts believe that the emergence of this new strain combined with less recent Covid-19 activity could start a wave in the next couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we have seen from several years of experience with Covid-19 is that infections tend to come in waves. A surge in cases leads to many people falling ill, then recovering and developing short-term immunity to infection. Infection rates decline for several months, then they begin to increase again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/16/health/summer-covid-rise-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Summer waves of Covid-19;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Summer waves of Covid-19&lt;/a&gt; have occurred over the past few years. It’s certainly possible that the pattern repeats this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: Who should consider getting the vaccine now instead of waiting for the fall formulation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a difficult question to answer because the landscape around Covid-19 vaccination has been changing. Just last month, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that Covid-19 shots &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/27/health/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-recommendation?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:are no longer recommended;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;are no longer recommended&lt;/a&gt; for healthy children and pregnant women. These shots appear to still be accessible for children; for instance, the CDC’s guidance &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/30/health/children-covid-vaccine-cdc?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:now reads;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;now reads&lt;/a&gt; that children can get the shots after consulting with their health care provider. However, there are already &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/12/health/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reports;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; of pregnant women having more difficulty obtaining these vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This and other guidance could soon change, as Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/11/health/kennedy-new-members-vaccine-advisory-panel?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reconstituted the panel;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reconstituted the panel&lt;/a&gt; of external experts who advise the CDC on vaccine recommendations, and this new panel could make different decisions during their upcoming meeting in late June. Another uncertainty is when a new round of vaccines will be made available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way to approach this decision is to consider your risk of severe outcomes if you were to contract Covid-19. Those who are 65 and over or who have chronic underlying medical conditions should consider getting another dose of the vaccine now, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:if they are eligible;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;if they are eligible&lt;/a&gt;. That way, they have additional protection in case there is a summer wave, since the existing vaccine probably retains some efficacy against the new variant. And they can still get another dose in the fall when the new formulation will presumably be released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for those who are younger and generally healthy, some who have not yet received the 2024-25 formulation also may consider getting the vaccine now before guidelines change and they may no longer be eligible. People should discuss their specific medical situations with their primary care physician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: What precautions should people consider to reduce their risk of contracting this variant?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The same precautions we’ve been discussing throughout the Covid-19 pandemic still apply. This is a respiratory virus that could be airborne, so be on guard, particularly in crowded indoor settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are especially vulnerable to severe disease should try to avoid these settings. If they need to go into, say, a crowded train station, they should consider wearing a well-fitting N95 or equivalent mask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those people visiting vulnerable individuals may wish to avoid higher-risk settings in the days before the visit to reduce the chance of spreading not only Covid-19 but also other respiratory illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 19:00:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxQa2JsSXVjRHNmUjNtWWRkYmFwODFGOHdwX1FKTVlzMmY0N2paN3o5N3hJbW80X2NKYVRRUGtRd0VWMHM1dXZTdy1MSDhFMFROTFh4cFBPUWxwWm0yeVpVZ1VtR21xX2ZOdVpuSlFBZDRRYXdMZUVHSURxZ3ZqbXBHYkpB</guid></item><item><title>美国宇航局代理局长珍妮特·佩特罗（ Janet Petro ） “拥抱挑战”更新2025年6月20日-美国宇航局观察 | Acting NASA Administrator Janet Petro ‘Embrace The Challenge’ Update June 20, 2025 - NASA Watch</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwgFBVV95cUxNOEN5SUNRUmxmUjRZLWJRSExETGJvODNZQUFZOGFNUGFlVG9HVHI3ZXBrcHBsekwxeFVRN0l1ZDVVcmV3VjhUazdsM0lMTXVYVHVzQkg3VTdkV2tJZU1vaVA2SkFFQTAxZ1I0NmstUUxtVV9KXzZFY2tmSF9DYVRkem5xQlV1ZUcwWFBwejFWMy1wTVl6MFJxZFg2dk5VUHpsbUE3R2hfY3RhM2lUNFV0OUR5MDRfajBsSnIwV1VlczRsUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wysiwyg"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keith’s note:&lt;/strong&gt; this weekly ‘Embrace The Challenge Update’ includes a link to a site where y ou can post questions for a 25 June agency wide town hall. It asks for name an email. So I used &lt;em&gt;Wehrner von Braun – &lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4e192b263c202b3c0e202f3d2f60292138"&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and I got in and posted &lt;em&gt;“So much for cybersecurity.”&lt;/em&gt; FYI the comment field says “&lt;em&gt;After submitting, your question will enter a moderation queue for approval&lt;/em&gt;” – In other words someone is going to filter the questions that Janet answers. Of course no one would ever think of censoring any of the questions that touch on certain topics. Just sayin’. &lt;strong&gt;Full memo below.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-19971"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt; As we move through summer, I know many of you are balancing mission demands, upcoming transitions, and well-earned time off. I want to thank you for everything you’re doing to keep us steady – whether you’re supporting a mission milestone, planning for what’s ahead, or helping maintain continuity at your center.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, we have an agencywide town hall scheduled for 1 p.m. EDT on Wednesday, June 25. You should have received a calendar invite, and &lt;a href="https://nasa.cnf.io/sessions/anq4/before?session_before_redirect=http%3A//nasa.cnf.io/sessions/anq4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here’s the link to submit questions online&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Vanessa, Casey, Brian, and I know this is a challenging time, and we’re committed to having an open and honest conversation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ahead of that, I want to acknowledge the very real challenges many organizations are facing as we work through the potential for a more focused budget. These impacts vary across mission directorates, centers, and support offices, but no part of the agency is untouched. Some have asked why we’re acting now, or whether we should wait to see how Congress acts. The reality is we must make responsible choices based on the funding we are projected to receive and begin shaping the workforce toward the missions we’ve been called to do. Using voluntary tools like the Deferred Resignation Program, Voluntary Early Retirement Authority, and Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment now gives us the best chance to prepare for the next Fiscal Year without resorting to other more disruptive actions. These are NASA’s decisions, made in service of our mission, and our people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://nasawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/unnamed.png" alt="" class="wp-image-19972" srcset="https://nasawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/unnamed.png 770w, https://nasawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/unnamed-300x186.png 300w, https://nasawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/unnamed-768x477.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, a lot continues to happen across the agency:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More than 260 stakeholders from government, industry, and academia joined our Advanced Modeling &amp;amp; Simulation Seminar to learn about the Launch, Ascent, and Vehicle Aerodynamics (LAVA) framework as the team gears up for its public release this fall. The framework is a computational fluid dynamics software system that can accurately simulate challenging problems central to our mission, from aircraft performance evaluation to launch environment characterization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I signed a new agreement this week at the Paris Air Show with our longtime partners at the German Aerospace Center – DLR – that will extend our collaboration in space medicine research. As part of this effort, DLR will provide radiation sensors to fly aboard Orion during Artemis II, helping us better understand the health risks of deep space exploration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This week, Expedition 73 aboard space station centered efforts on exercise research, spacesuit readiness, and science operations – including studying fluid behavior in microgravity using containerless liquid systems – while NASA teams on the ground continue to review the recent repair to the Zvezda module’s aft segment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our TRACERS mission has reached an important milestone this week. The twin spacecraft – designed to study how solar wind interacts with Earth’s magnetosphere – arrived at Vandenberg Space Force Base. They will soon be integrated with a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket ahead of a planned July launch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On June 13, years of space technology investments to expand commercial launch capabilities culminated in the successful maiden flight of UP Aerospace’s Spyder hypersonic rocket. The new launch system offers a low-cost vehicle to enable enhanced suborbital missions and planetary re-entry test environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’d like to congratulate Rich Burns at Goddard and John Blevins at Marshall on being named 2025 Service to America Medal honorees – better known as the Sammies. Rich led the OSIRIS-REx mission, which successfully returned samples from asteroid Bennu and is helping us better understand the origins of our solar system. John, as chief engineer for SLS (Space Launch System) rocket, played a key role in the Artemis I mission and is helping us prepare for Artemis II. These awards recognize the highest levels of public service, and Rich and John’s work reflects the dedication and excellence that define our NASA team.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Embrace the Challenge,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Janet&lt;/p&gt;

It has an average survival rate of 12 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man, who posted his story in an &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/1lbdcel/i_have_six_months_to_live_ama/"&gt;anonymous Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt;, has just six months left to live despite living 'a very healthy lifestyle' and having no family history of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'I never smoked, almost never drank, ate clean and exercised daily. Sometimes biology lets you down.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pancreatic cancer affects roughly 67,000 Americans every year and kills about 52,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than half the time, the disease is first spotted after it has already reached stage three or four due to its vague symptoms. These include abdominal pain, weight loss, back pain, jaundice and floating or clay-colored stools. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This leads patients to assume their symptoms are from more benign causes like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was the case for Clair Honeywood, a 45-year-old from the UK who chocked her severe stomach pain up to IBS. She was diagnosed with inoperable pancreatic cancer and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14392951/deadly-pancreatic-cancer-warning-signs-stomach-pain-IBS.html"&gt;given a year to live&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Matthew Rosenblum of Michigan assumed his &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13301841/diagnosed-lethal-pancreatic-cancer-miracle-drug-combo.html"&gt;bone-white stools&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 were from Crohn's disease, but it was actually stage four pancreatic cancer at age 32. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear exactly what causes pancreatic cancer, but smoking, obesity and diabetes are thought to increase the risk by inducing harmful inflammation that causes cells to divide and become mutated more easily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man in the Reddit thread, however, blames his diagnosis on bad luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'Before this diagnosis, I was in perfect health. I thought I had another 50 years left. The first thought was “This is too soon.”'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The former engineer said he will soon move into hospice care and try psilocybin therapy for pain and the mental health effects that have come with his diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Psilocybin, the psychoactive ingredient in magic mushrooms, has been thought to reduce anxiety and depression in cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also has signed up for several clinical trials. It's unclear if he will be getting standard treatments like chemotherapy or radiation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Clair Honeywood (left), 45, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at stage three after mistaking her symptoms for IBS. Matthew Rosenblum, meanwhile, thought his bone-white stools were from Crohn's disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Early signs of pancreatic cancer include jaundice, stomach pain, back pain, weight loss, and floating stools&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For now, he is focusing on using up his savings on vacations, scuba diving, skydiving and other items on his bucket list. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His main regret is not taking enough risks like 'starting a business, moving to another place, trying something you were interested in but didn't know if you could do.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In the end, your failures are often not as consequential as you might think,' he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'I’m glad I’ve been able to experience life. In all the possible realities I could’ve existed in, this was a pretty good one. Even if it’s short. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I don’t have any grandiose aspirations for my legacy. A simple “that guy was alright” is good enough for me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The biggest piece of advice I would give is to not take the time you have for granted. I know that’s probably a worn out statement, but it rings incredibly true when you realize how finite your life really is.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 18:14:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxPYjFjZHUzOHNGbG00bU9CUFBvXzdZemFYaVdRWnE0NEhXSndyeXFZcG42ZjVrZnQxOGN6cWRWcXhnR0ZXdV9TVFFndTA1NTBmckVqVndWalQzUEx4Qi1oZm54NEx0V1lETE1oQmNTdXFUY3RabllvM0Q4UjFyWFRwbTV0WjI3U3BLeGc2WExFb3hnUVRzQkFkWG0zZ1laVXJpSUNFbmxhYWFqQ0VEbC0xTDZR0gG3AUFVX3lxTE43RGp2R1RzTkFpS1RGWjd0eV9CVTFLazlvVkN3dlhfQ2NuOEdFQk1WNm5heUJKRENCczNTekJfTUxVU3VUOGhTR0VaeVVvS18zdG1jaERfOG1MeDdsMkYwX0NtMThUc2dUcUNzRzNzMXI3SnM0ZWlBYzROenl1VThrZ1J4RFg0VlBNVWtWcXk5cHJ0UmlsQTBMTGZhajlPeEVHeDJsS3JOUHkxaUR2d2tMZlowZ3l4aw</guid></item><item><title>男性在获得捐赠肾脏后健康崩溃-它充斥着蠕虫- Ars Technica | Man’s health crashes after getting donated kidney—it was riddled with worms - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFBVV95cUxQVVdxSjBodGJCeThZSC1XTEpMLVh0Ny1rOExDam90WXhqVWgwbzd2VF9xY24zdzZBZWRoZHJIMWpLRFdVdHRpRkh3cGZkeWotc0V4WEVNTHhEQ0R4b2RXRHotU3F0alNBTkxOc1VhNy1tN2QyUWl6S3luRlZrc3lWSmVSczNfazA0TmlqX051MmdfRHFxWFVoYTFYeVNnUDVNa2J3aWlaeU9sbDNqWlpMYmdqOWw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;About two months after receiving a donated kidney, a 61-year-old man ended up back in the hospital. He was tired, nauseous, and vomiting. He was also excessively thirsty and producing too much urine. Over the next 10 days, things only got worse. The oxygen levels in his blood began to fall. His lungs filled with fluid. He kept vomiting. He couldn't eat. Doctors inserted a feeding tube. His oxygen levels and blood pressure kept falling. He was admitted to the intensive care unit and put on mechanical ventilation. Still, things kept getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, he was transferred to the ICU of Massachusetts General Hospital, where he had received the transplant. He was in acute respiratory failure and shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2412510"&gt;a case report in this week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, doctors at Mass General explained how they determined what was wrong with the man. Their first steps were collecting more information about the man's symptoms from his wife, reviewing his family medical history, and contacting the regional organ-procurement organization that provided the kidney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Process of elimination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man's condition and laboratory tests suggested he had some sort of infection. But as a transplant recipient who was on a variety of immunosuppressive drugs, the list of infectious possibilities was "extensive."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Camille Kotton, Clinical Director of the hospital's Transplant and Immunocompromised Host Infectious Diseases division, laid out her thinking. She started with a process of elimination. As an immunosuppressed transplant patient, he was also on several medications to proactively prevent infections. These would rule out herpesviruses and cytomegalovirus. He was also on a combination of antibiotics that would rule out many bacterial infections, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482370/"&gt;fungal infection &lt;em&gt;Pneumocystis jirovecii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that strikes the immunocompromised and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK563286/"&gt;the protozoan parasite &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One feature stood out: The man had developed elevated levels of eosinophils, white blood cells that can increase for various reasons—including parasitic infections. The man also had a reddish-purple rash over his abdomen. Coupled with the severity of his illness, Kotton suspected a widespread parasitic infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man's history was notable for contact with domestic cats and dogs—including a cat scratch in the time between having the transplant and falling critically ill. But common bacterial infections linked to cat scratches could be ruled out. And other parasitic infections that might come from domestic animals in the US, such as toxocariasis, don't typically lead to such critical illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

However, potassium is arguably just as important. In fact, research suggests that diets that are higher in potassium and lower in sodium can help lower blood pressure levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; We spoke with a medical doctor and two registered dietitians to understand why potassium is the #1 nutrient to help reduce blood pressure.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290730/signs-youre-not-getting-enough-potassium-and-what-to-do-about-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Potassium&lt;/a&gt; and sodium work together to maintain fluid balance in the body, which affects blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; When the body is properly hydrated and these nutrients are consumed in adequate amounts, fluid levels remain balanced. However, problems arise when there’s an imbalance of sodium and potassium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “When your body has more sodium than potassium, it increases your blood volume, causing more pressure on your blood vessels,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.thekidneydietitian.org/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Melanie Betz, MS, RD, CSR, FAND&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to &lt;a href="https://www.nymc.edu/som/faculty/naidu-srihari-s.php" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Srihari S. Naidu, MD, FACC, FSCAI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://entirelynourished.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Michelle Routhenstein, MS, RD, CDE, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, another way potassium helps lower blood pressure is by increasing the excretion of sodium by the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-and-worst-foods-for-kidneys-8411479" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;kidneys&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Not only is this important for lowering blood pressure, but it may also help reduce kidney damage. Over time, consistently high blood pressure can damage the blood vessels in and around the kidneys, making it harder for the kidneys to function properly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One of the functions impacted is the kidneys’ ability to remove excess sodium, making blood pressure more challenging to control.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potassium helps the smooth muscle cells in blood vessel walls relax, which eases tension and lowers resistance within the arteries. This relaxation allows blood to flow more freely, resulting in reduced blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Additionally, potassium helps keep blood vessels open by inhibiting angiotensin—a hormone produced in the liver and metabolized by the kidneys—that causes blood vessels to tighten.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Healthy adults are recommended to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069581/what-does-potassium-do/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;consume 3,400 mg per day of potassium&lt;/a&gt; for men and 2,600 mg per day for women. For folks with high blood pressure, the American Heart Association recommends bumping intake up to 3,500 mg to 5,00 mg per day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Despite the benefits of eating potassium, Naidu cautions that high potassium intake can be dangerous for certain folks, including some older adults, those with kidney disease and people on medications that can increase blood potassium levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;According to Naidu, high levels of potassium can also cause arrhythmias, where the heart's rhythm is out of sync. Before increasing your potassium intake, Naidu recommends talking with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290053/8-foods-with-more-potassium-than-a-banana/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;potassium-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;, bananas likely come to mind first. However, you may be surprised by just how many foods contain potassium. And this is good news as Betz and Routhenstein recommend meeting your potassium needs by eating a wide variety of foods. Here are a few examples of foods that are high or good sources of potassium:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating a potassium-rich diet is just one piece of the puzzle for better blood pressure Here are additional strategies to help lower your levels: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try the DASH diet: &lt;/strong&gt;Routhenstein recommends considering the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2054270/how-to-follow-the-dash-diet/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet&lt;/a&gt;—an eating plan specifically designed to help lower blood pressure by limiting sodium intake and encouraging foods containing potassium, magnesium and calcium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Active: &lt;/strong&gt;According to Naidu, regular physical activity can help lower blood pressure and support overall heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For optimal health, it’s recommended to aim for 150 minutes of cardiovascular exercise per week and at least two strength-training sessions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage Stress: &lt;/strong&gt;Stress hormones—like cortisol—can cause your blood pressure to rise, especially during times of prolonged or chronic stress.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To help &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8054352/6-fast-ways-to-lower-cortisol-levels/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lower cortisol levels&lt;/a&gt;—and blood pressure—find a few &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-relieve-stress-in-10-minutes-8739935" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;stress management techniques&lt;/a&gt; you can do regularly, such as journaling, yoga, meditation or going for a walk outside. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit Alcohol and Avoid Smoking: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-alcohol-does-to-your-body-8747903" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Alcohol&lt;/a&gt; can elevate the hormone renin, which causes blood vessels to constrict and blood pressure levels to rise.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you choose to drink, do so in moderation: no more than 1 drink per day for women or 2 drinks per day for men. Smoking is another major risk factor as it can cause your blood vessels to narrow and restrict blood flow.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Avoid smoking (if you haven’t started), or talk to your healthcare provider about ways to quit. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Often overlooked, potassium is essential for healthy blood pressure. It helps maintain fluid balance, supports kidney health and relaxes smooth muscle in blood vessel walls. High potassium intake isn’t safe for everyone—especially those with kidney disease. However, for most healthy adults, it’s recommended to enjoy a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/11369/healthy-recipes-for-potassium-rich-foods/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;variety of potassium-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;, such as plantains, lima beans and dark leafy greens. In addition to enjoying more high-potassium foods, making other lifestyle changes, including managing sodium intake, following the DASH diet, staying active, reducing stress, limiting alcohol and avoiding smoking, can go a long way in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-healthy-blood-pressure-meal-plan-for-beginners-8724322" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;supporting healthy blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.

She was given six months to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a decade later she is living a full and vibrant life - defying the odds in what doctors call a 'miracle' case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2015, she began experiencing headaches and seizures, prompting her to go to the hospital. Doctors found &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14408499/unusual-sign-cancer-decade-glioblastoma-brain-symptom.html"&gt;a tumor in her brainstem&lt;/a&gt;, called a glioma, a typically fatal &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-03d25b20-4df1-11f0-890e-2ff2c2bfa2b3"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; with minimal treatment options that are often unsuccessful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors said she had about six months to live until the cancer, which has a survival rate of about eight percent, killed her.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wethor said: ‘Because my tumor is so difficult to treat, I was able to leave the hospital and spend my "last six months" doing what I love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘During those first six months, when I thought they might be my last, I made it a mission to do something creative every single day.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She painted, taught herself how to play guitar, and made fashion a form of self-expression. She visited museums with her mother, which she said 'was crucial to keeping my mind off my diagnosis and current health circumstances.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While she never received treatment, her symptoms – &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14808807/brain-cancer-perimenopause-symptom-sign.html"&gt;headaches, fatigue, and seizures&lt;/a&gt; – became manageable with a healthy balance of mindfulness and physical health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Ten years ago, doctors discovered a tumor in her brainstem—a usually fatal cancer. Yet Wethor has beaten the odds, living a vibrant life full of adventure and creativity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s not always perfect, but I’ve found ways to work with my body rather than against it,’ she said. ‘Most days, I’m able to live a full and relatively normal life…I don’t assume I have time.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, an advocate for cancer research, Wethor undergoes MRI scans, fearing all the time that the cancer has grown. But she hasn't let that fear take over her life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A glioma of the brain stem is a tumor that develops in the area connecting the brain to the spinal cord and can come in different varieties based on the specific type of glial cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The brainstem is crucial in controlling vital functions such as breathing, heart rate, swallowing, and movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Damage to it can lead to a wide range of devastating effects that Wethor fears are lurking just around the corner, including difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brainstem gliomas are rare and more common in children than adults. Every year, there are roughly 300 cases in adults and 500 cases in children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is the same cancer President Joe Biden's son Beau had. He was diagnosed in 2013 and died two years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My doctors can’t explain why I have survived,’ she said. ‘I still have my tumor, but miraculously, it has not grown.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no treatment for this form of cancer, leaving her wondering when her regular MRI scan will show that the tumor has grown and pressure on her brain has worsened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors do not know what prompted the tumor to develop, how it might respond to treatment, what the best available treatments are, or whether it will come back if a patient reaches remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Grace Wethor in 2020. While not in treatment, her symptoms – headaches, fatigue, and seizures – are manageable with a healthy balance of mindfulness and physical health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;‘The hope is that one day a trial or new treatment will emerge that can help tumors in this area of the brain,’ she said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wethor’s expectation-exceeding survival is nothing short of miraculous, given the tiny chance of survival given to her as a teen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘Because of the complexity of the brain stem, doctors aren’t able to biopsy or do surgery on these tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This means that as soon as these tumors start growing, there isn’t much that can be done to help the patient - especially because chemotherapy and radiation also have a slim chance of working.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Radiation’s effect is often short-lived, chemotherapy often fails and there are no targeted therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When symptoms appear, such as double vision, slurred speech, and imbalance, the cancer has spread beyond help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The hope is that one day a trial or new treatment will emerge that can help tumors in this area of the brain,’ she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There have been some advancements but we still have a long way to go.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Grace Wethor with her mother in 2023. Now she approaches each day as an adventure, knowing no one is guaranteed tomorrow, brain tumor or not. This experience had made that truth impossible to ignore&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From the outside, she said, nobody would know she has a brain tumor. And while she still gets headaches and other symptoms, she has been able to find creative outlets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cancer could worsen at any moment, but Wethor doesn’t fear death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Social workers would ask her if she was afraid of dying, but she realized it was the wrong question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Really what I should have been asked was if I was afraid of living – living with this reality and wondering how long I and others could live under that stress and unknown,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I try to live every day as an adventure, because no one is guaranteed any amount of time, brain tumor or no brain tumor, and this experience has made that impossible to ignore.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 16:27:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>新研究表明，您的握力可以预测您的寿命- AOL.com | Your Grip Might Predict How Long You’ll Live, New Study Suggests - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE9kTHdnYjExMnJBWURxeTN2WWl0NGlxOENpMVZGRVZQMlcwaDhVcURCNjZ6RHY1R3EyTFJkWWYxZjJ6SGg0NTNRN28zVHhBdUZXdHFhdFNQajcyQmFjX1JUMWRkeUM2QlZtbkN2N3FB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;This Simple Test May Indicate Longevity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;andreswd - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many tests claim to be able to tell how long you’ll live. But research suggests that a simple measure you can do at home is highly predictive of longevity. It’s known as your grip strength, and it measures the force or pressure your hand exerts when squeezing or holding an object. Grip strength can be measured in a doctor’s office, or you can pick up a device called a hand grip dynamometer (like this &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Handeful-Dynamometer-Measurement-Electronic-Strengthener/dp/B08X4JQDJZ/ref=sr_1_5?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.65125207%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;) to check it at home on your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://mdmercy.com/find-a-doctor/clayton-alexander-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clayton Alexander, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clayton Alexander, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, orthopedic surgeon and hand specialist at Mercy Medical Center; &lt;a href="https://rwjms.rutgers.edu/people/alfred-tallia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alfred F.

But doctors say there is something to grip strength and indicating a healthy, long life. Here’s what the study found, plus what doctors want you to keep in mind when using this as a measurement of your health status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38595265/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, analyzed data from more than 12,000 adults aged 50 and older for 12 years. The researchers used handgrip dynamometry measurements to track grip strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that people with weaker grip strengths had a 45% higher risk of dying during the study period than those with stronger grips. The researchers concluded that grip strength provides a “robust prediction of time to mortality” and suggests that healthcare providers encourage people to do strength training as they get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Muscle health is part of overall health, and longevity is a significant health outcome,” says &lt;a href="https://www.ndsu.edu/hnes/faculty_and_staff/ryan_mcgrath/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ryan McGrath., Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ryan McGrath., Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, lead study author and associate professor in the department of Health, Nutrition, and Exercise Sciences at North Dakota State University. “Understanding how aspects of muscle health, such as strength, may connect with health outcomes is important for informing relevant programs and lifespan health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How might grip strength be linked to longevity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a new concept, and, in fact, doctors usually test grip strength during check-ups as people get older or if they’re getting ready for surgery. “It’s part of the measure of frailty,” says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/199050-david-m-cutler" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:David Cutler, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;David Cutler, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. “We use frailty as a measurement all the time to assess someone’s risk for surgery and health status.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grip strength has emerged as an indicator of total body muscle mass and strength, explains &lt;a href="https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=ns1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nikhil Satchidanand, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nikhil Satchidanand, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, exercise physiologist and assistant professor in the University at Buffalo Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Division of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine. “It is not just a measure of muscle power but also helps us understand the general health of our skeletal muscles,” he says. “In clinical and research settings, grip strength is used as a non-invasive, easy, and cost-effective way to gather information about an individual’s overall health and function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good grip strength is also crucial for survival, points out &lt;a href="https://rwjms.rutgers.edu/people/alfred-tallia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alfred F. Tallia, M.D., M.P.H.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alfred F. Tallia, M.D., M.P.H.&lt;/a&gt;, professor and chair of family medicine and community health at the Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. “The ability to grasp things is an essential part of our daily lives that touches our success at all activities of daily living—feeding, bathing, clothing ourselves, ambulating, and movement,” he says. “So it is not at all surprising that a decline in grip strength is correlated with prediction of impending death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tips for improving grip strength&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite all of that, grip strength isn’t the end-all, be-all for longevity. In fact, Dr. Cutler points out that it’s “just one of several measures” doctors use to look at a person’s health status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know that it’s the grip strength that leads to a longer life, and we don’t know if it will improve their longevity, but we can use measurements that include both grip strength and other standard frailty measurements,” Dr. Cutler says. (Those include things like whether someone has multiple underlying health conditions and if they’ve lost significant weight lately with no explanation, he says.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you want to improve your grip strength, there are things you can do. “You can improve grip strength by using a grip strength trainer, but just because you do so does not mean you can reduce mortality,” Dr. Alexander says. (It just may mean that you’ll be better at opening jars or grasping weights.) You can also try repeatedly squeezing a ball, McGrath says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But experts stress that your grip strength can only tell so much about how long you’ll live. “Grip strength loss is just a marker of frailty—it is not the cause of mortality,” Dr. Alexander says. If you’re concerned that your grip isn’t strong, McGrath says you can work on it. But you’re worried about your overall health, he recommends focusing on physical activity and eating a healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 16:18:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE9kTHdnYjExMnJBWURxeTN2WWl0NGlxOENpMVZGRVZQMlcwaDhVcURCNjZ6RHY1R3EyTFJkWWYxZjJ6SGg0NTNRN28zVHhBdUZXdHFhdFNQajcyQmFjX1JUMWRkeUM2QlZtbkN2N3FB</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，排名第一的低估食物可以增加您的镁摄入量- EatingWell | The #1 Underrated Food to Increase Your Magnesium Intake, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxNcnhiRE16VFBFbm45ZjhwLWZXY252SW55Q2tmRmNIb1VyU0xTMnRxTFJGZFJPTGE1c1JRcS1LbkFYdm1MM21Mb09pbEZfS1hvRmItVUpTWHQyX0IwbEhKd0hJOFFBcHJoQXh6MWE1bVpFazlwVGRfTGFZYU1QVkNiMWV2eDVUWEctTUQyZDJnZVhlVVBqR0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adequate magnesium intake supports a healthy heart, better sleep and good digestion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chia seeds are an excellent source of magnesium. They also offer fiber, protein and omega-3 fatty acids. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can enjoy chia seeds in so many ways, including overnight oats, chia pudding and jam.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium doesn’t receive as much airtime as other nutrients (like protein), yet it’s so important for maintaining our whole-body health. The mineral helps with heart and nerve function, blood pressure, blood sugar regulation, strong bones and energy production. “Magnesium is a mineral your body needs to help over 300 little ‘helper’ proteins (called enzymes) do their jobs,” says &lt;a href="https://inutritioncenter.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Vanessa Imus, RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When magnesium levels are low, your first symptoms may include muscle cramps, fatigue or poor sleep, says Imus.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you’re not eating enough &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-metabolic-syndrome-11736662" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;, such as leafy greens, nuts, seeds and whole grains, you’re probably low in this mineral. Let’s zero in on seeds as a source of magnesium: Dietitians say &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dangers-of-chia-seeds-11717491" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;chia seeds&lt;/a&gt;, specifically, are a simple, underrated way to add more magnesium to your day.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One ounce (about 2 tablespoons) of chia seeds offers 95 milligrams of magnesium, which provides 23% of your Daily Value.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That same 1-ounce serving has &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7959854/ways-to-add-5-grams-of-fiber-to-your-meals/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;10 grams of fiber&lt;/a&gt; (!), 5 grams of the omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid and 5 grams of protein. Chia seeds also offer B vitamins and are a source of a number of antioxidants, including chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, kaempferol and quercetin.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds provide magnesium and fiber, both of which are essential for maintaining a healthy digestive system. For starters, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-benefits-8656021" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium may help promote&lt;/a&gt; the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut.  These bacteria work to improve the gut barrier’s function and balance the microbiome, Imus says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Not only that, but magnesium may also help regulate bowel movements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Two tablespoons of chia seeds pack an impressive 35% of your fiber needs. Eating more fiber helps with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-before-in-the-morning-to-help-you-poop-11718405" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;digestion regularity&lt;/a&gt; so that you’re going to the bathroom consistently (and easily)—just make sure to drink plenty of water.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The ample amount of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/signs-youre-not-getting-enough-magnesium-11740104" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, fiber and omega-3 fats found in chia seeds also supports a healthy heart. Chia seeds may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lower-triglycerides-mistakes-11742759" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lowering triglyceride and LDL cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;, while also raising HDL cholesterol.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds, especially ground chia seeds, can increase levels of omega-3 fatty acids in the blood, which can help fight heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In turn, low magnesium levels have been linked to issues like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7906963/sneaky-reasons-blood-pressure-is-high-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and irregular heartbeat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re not sleeping well, it could be a sign your body needs more magnesium, says &lt;a href="https://sproutoutloud.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ali McGowan, M.S., RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;: “Chia seeds are a small, easy step to help fill that gap.” Observational studies have found that low magnesium intake may be linked to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8076313/magnesium-for-sleep/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;sleep problems&lt;/a&gt; like snoring, short sleep duration and daytime sleepiness.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, emerging research has found that omega-3 fatty acids may also improve how well you sleep. A clinical trial found that EPA and DHA &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/exercise-sleep-insomnia-risk-new-study-8628457" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;improved sleep quantity and quality&lt;/a&gt; compared to a placebo.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds have a slight earthy taste, but otherwise, they don’t have much flavor. This means chia seeds can easily be added to many dishes and recipes to add thickness while also boosting the nutritional offerings. “I love adding chia seeds to overnight oats, blending them into smoothies for extra thickness, or making a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cinnamon-roll-oatmeal-8690614" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;quick pudding with milk, cinnamon and vanilla&lt;/a&gt;,” says McGowan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add to oats: &lt;/strong&gt;Add fun texture and thickness to your overnight oats recipe. You can add chia seeds ground or whole, just make sure to add more liquid for the seeds to soak up, or else your breakfast may be dry. The &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-high-protein-high-fiber-meal-plan-for-weight-loss-11736989" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber and protein combo&lt;/a&gt; from chia seeds will give you more staying power (i.e., you’ll feel fuller longer) throughout the morning.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make chia pudding: &lt;/strong&gt;Chia pudding couldn’t be easier to pull together. Just combine chia seeds with your choice of liquid (milk and plant-based milks work well) and voilà, chia pudding. Adding flavors like vanilla, ground cinnamon, honey or maple syrup will take your pudding up a notch. Or try our go-to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seed-pudding-8430793" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Chia Seed Pudding&lt;/a&gt; recipe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create your own jam: &lt;/strong&gt;Store-bought jam can be high in added sugar and low in nutrients, so consider making your own with chia seeds. It’s as simple as combining a fruit of your choice—frozen berries work well—with chia seeds.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Imus also reminds us not to overdo it. ​​“Chia seeds absorb a lot of water, and too much may lead to constipation or bloating.” Starting with 1 to 2 tablespoons is a reasonable amount.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds make for a great way to up your intake of magnesium. Two tablespoons of chia seeds provide about a quarter of our daily needs, which helps support a healthy heart, better sleep and good digestion. Try adding the seeds to overnight oats, smoothies, yogurt or toast for a boost in not only magnesium, but also omega-3 fatty acids, fiber and protein.

&lt;p&gt;Some oral bacteria and related virulence factors, such as molecules that help bacteria colonize the body — many of which can trigger a potent inflammatory response — were significantly enriched in the guts of Parkinson’s patients with cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that promoting a healthy microbiome through consistent oral care, a balanced diet, and potentially targeted probiotic interventions could support improved disease management in Parkinson’s,” Saeed Shoaie, PhD, the study’s lead at King’s College London in the U.K., said in a &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/mouth-and-gut-bacteria-linked-to-brain-changes-in-parkinsons-disease"&gt;university news story&lt;/a&gt;. The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2025.2506843#abstract"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Microbiome signatures of virulence in the oral-gut-brain axis influence Parkinson’s disease and cognitive decline pathophysiology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Gut Microbes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with Parkinson’s can have a range of &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/non-motor/"&gt;nonmotor symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, including gastrointestinal problems such as constipation or nausea, in the years before &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/motor/"&gt;motor symptoms&lt;/a&gt; appear. Changes in the gut may play a role in Parkinson’s development via the communication system between the gut and the brain, called the gut-brain axis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the oral health of Parkinson’s patients also impacts the course of their disease, the contribution of mouth bacteria has been largely overlooked. In fact, &lt;em&gt;Porphyromonas gingivalis&lt;/em&gt;, a well-studied oral bacterium, has been found in the brain of people with &lt;a href="https://alzheimersnewstoday.com/approved-treatments-for-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, and active gum disease, or periodontitis, has been reported to impact cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The human gut and oral bacterial communities are increasingly linked to neurodegenerative diseases,” Shoaie said. “Disruptions in the gut-brain axis could trigger inflammation and immune responses that contribute to neuronal damage.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Gut, oral microbiome effect on cognition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined gut and mouth bacteria collected from the stool and saliva samples of Parkinson’s patients with mild cognitive decline and dementia to explore the role of gut and oral microbiomes on cognitive impairment. A group of healthy people served as controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s patients with dementia had significantly less gut microbiome diversity than those with mild cognitive impairment. There was also a decrease in microbial diversity and the metagenomic species richness, or the total number of different species within a microbial community, in the oral microbiome of those with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a species analysis, there was a limited number of overlapping bacterial species across all three groups, meaning many species were uniquely enriched or depleted in patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. This suggests “these microbial changes are likely associated with [cognitive impairment],” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a predictive assessment, the changes in microbial species were sensitive enough to differentiate between Parkinson’s patients with varying clinical features, and adding data like age and sex significantly improved the predictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We don’t yet know if the bacteria are causing the cognitive decline or if changes in the body due to Parkinson’s allow these bacteria to grow,” said Frederick Clasen, PhD, the study’s first author and research associate at King’s College London. “But our findings suggest they may play an active role in worsening symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;When oral bacteria move to the gut&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers then investigated so-called oral-gut translocation, wherein oral bacteria move into the gut, where they don’t usually live. Data showed the guts of patients with dementia were significantly enriched with mouth bacteria. Moreover, those with cognitive impairment or dementia had significantly higher levels of oral-specific virulence factors in the gut, that is, molecules that help the bacterium colonize the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The identified virulence factors had various functions, including stress, immune modulation, adherence, biofilm formation, invasion, and metabolism. Some are important for bacteria to infect cells that line the blood vessels in the brain. At the same time, several other factors related to immune modulation were involved in producing LPS, a molecule on bacterial surfaces that triggers inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These toxins could be used as biological markers to identify patients at higher risk of dementia in Parkinson’s,” Clasen said. “In the future, they might also be targets for new treatments that protect the brain by changing the gut environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers also saw a drop in several types of bacteria in the mouth of patients with dementia or cognitive impairment compared with healthy people, which could suggest a loss of healthy bacterial balance, making it easier for harmful bacteria to take over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our study provides compelling evidence that the interplay between oral and gut microbiomes significantly influences [Parkinson’s] and [cognitive impairment],” the researcher wrote. “The translocation of oral microbial species to the gut, along with their associated [virulence factors], highlights new avenues for understanding disease mechanisms and developing potential biomarkers and therapeutic avenues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shoaie said the “emerging evidence underscores the potential importance of maintaining oral and gut health in mitigating or slowing neurodegenerative processes. As people with Parkinson’s become increasingly reliant on carers, routine practices such as oral hygiene and nutritional intake may be neglected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Parkinson's News Today</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 15:38:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxQVVlpYWVoX2dUdmJrSFJlcF9kRlB4MU1reHNELUw0ZDZXMEVzblVBTnp1LWhmM1diaUJXMzBvSDZQRjZfSjRfZ3V0eEJZd241b0hUdE9yRlFZMnRCNjU5YlRiZ25yblBydlVUNmxOX0FaWjhYQlRhWXhaYVpnRmZWYWh5SnZGSEZ0bXZKeDRXV1FPNVR0T290ZW1zcGZ1Y3Z0TXc</guid></item><item><title>首次显示的慢性疲劳综合征如何影响患者血液的量表- Medical Xpress | Scale of how chronic fatigue syndrome affects patients' blood shown for first time - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxQb0FZZjFqNjJ6UVJkeGpHRkR4VUZka1hrVEgwRzIyMTJpY09CWndfa2YtRW5VcGlxeFY1cWtsOVVPV1FnYjBPYWtSR1JoZXVzRGlpaGxCTUpITjlxQi1TLWZuZ1NDaEIySEc4Y1Z4Z0J4OXZ5ZEhZMkVPdVZoTzJ4VDRoZUZxZnpPSkE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with ME/CFS (myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome) have significant differences in their blood compared with healthy individuals, a new study reveals, suggesting a path toward more reliable diagnosis of the long-term debilitating illness. The paper is &lt;a href="https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/s44321-025-00258-8" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;EMBO Molecular Medicine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The largest ever biological study of ME/CFS has identified consistent blood differences associated with chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, and liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significantly, the results were mostly unaffected by patients' activity levels, as low activity levels can sometimes hide the biological signs of illness, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volume and consistency of the blood differences support the long-term goal of developing a blood test to help diagnose ME/CFS, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ME/CFS' key feature, called post-exertional malaise, is a delayed dramatic worsening of symptoms following minor physical effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other symptoms include pain, brain fog and extreme energy limitation that does not improve with rest. Causes are unknown and there is currently no diagnostic test or cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists from the University of Edinburgh's Institute of Genetics and Cancer worked with researchers from the Schools of Mathematics and Informatics to better understand the biology that underpins the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They used data from the UK Biobank—a health database of over half a million people—to compare 1,455 ME/CFS patients with 131,000 healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They examined more than 3,000 blood-based biomarkers and used advanced models to account for differences associated with age, sex, and activity levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results, which were replicated afterwards using data from the US, showed that hundreds of biomarkers differed between ME/CFS patients and healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Some 116 significant differences were found in both men and women, a key finding as ME/CFS can affect sexes differently. The consistent results across both groups strengthens the reliability of the biomarkers, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strongest biomarker differences were found in people who reported symptoms consistent with post-exertional malaise, highlighting its central role in the illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe these &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/biomarker/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;biomarker&lt;/a&gt; changes are more likely a result of ME/CFS, rather than the initial trigger of the illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Chris Ponting, of the MRC Human Genetics Unit at the University of Edinburgh's Institute of Genetics and Cancer, said, "For so long, people with ME/CFS have been told it's all in their head. It's not: we see people's ME/CFS in their blood. Evidence that there is a large number of replicated and diverse blood biomarkers that differentiate between ME/CFS cases and controls should now dispel any lingering perception that ME/CFS is caused by deconditioning and exercise intolerance."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sjoerd Beentjes, of the School of Mathematics, said, "Blood differences are sometimes attributed to reduced activity levels, rather than ME/CFS directly. By applying very recent advances in the statistical and causal inference literature, our study provides strong evidence that ME/CFS affects blood traits through paths other than activity."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ava Khamseh, of the School of Informatics, said, "This work has been an exciting cross-disciplinary and collaborative effort to integrate mathematical statistics, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/machine+learning/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;machine learning&lt;/a&gt; and biomedical expertise from across the University to answer a challenged-led question for ME/CFS research."&lt;/p&gt;

The energy they produce is critical in the brain as this organ consumes roughly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8364152/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;20 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the body’s resting energy budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, no one had measured how these organelles are arranged across the brain in three dimensions, which left a gap between the knowledge of cellular biology and the understanding of mental feats that rise or fall with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-energy-from-brain-mitochondria-matters"&gt;Why energy from brain mitochondria matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The biology of the brain, we know now, is deeply intertwined with the energetics of the brain,” said &lt;a href="https://www.columbia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; psychobiologist &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.columbia.edu/profile/martin-picard-phd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Martin Picard&lt;/a&gt;, a co‑author of the new work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picard and an international team built the &lt;a href="http://humanmitobrainmap.bcblab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MitoBrainMap&lt;/a&gt; from 703 match‑head‑sized samples taken from the donated brain of a 54‑year‑old man who died of a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists profiled &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553192/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;oxidative phosphorylation&lt;/a&gt; capacity, mitochondrial DNA copies, and organelle volume in every cube, then trained a model that predicts energy traits for the rest of the brain with MRI‑level resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cutting-the-brain-into-cubes"&gt;Cutting the brain into cubes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each 0.12‑inch (3 millimeter) cube matched the smallest unit a hospital scanner can currently resolve, thereby bridging lab assays with clinical images. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Handling nearly seven hundred samples demanded robotic slicing, automated biochemistry, and hefty computing power, yet the approach preserved regional context that test‑tube studies lose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once trained, the model reconstructed a whole‑&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-brains-use-storage-trick-to-keep-your-memories-in-sequential-order/"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; atlas that can overlay standard neuroimages, letting clinicians see where energy shortfalls align with symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-old-brain-regions-had-fewest-mitochondria"&gt;Old brain regions had fewest mitochondria &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evolutionarily ancient areas such as the brainstem and basal ganglia showed the sparsest mitochondrial coverage, indicating the lowest production of energy for brain cells. More recently evolved cortical folds, in comparison, brimmed with high‑output organelles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;German neuroscientist &lt;a href="https://valentinriedl.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Valentin Riedl&lt;/a&gt;, who was not involved in the project, called the feat “technically impressive and conceptually groundbreaking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gradient matches behavioral observations: functions like balance and breathing endure late into life, whereas problem‑solving and working memory (tasks seated in newer cortical regions) fade first when energy falters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-evolutionary-changes-in-brain-mitochondria-functions"&gt;Evolutionary changes in brain mitochondria functions &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings align with evolutionary &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7617105/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;theories&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that more recently developed brain regions evolved to support complex tasks like language, planning, and abstract thinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/your-brain-is-constantly-making-predictions-about-the-world-and-your-place-in-reality/"&gt;functions &lt;/a&gt;require more energy, which explains why newer cortical areas are packed with higher-density and more efficient mitochondria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, older brain structures responsible for survival functions like breathing or heart rate regulation operate on lower energy demands. This evolutionary layering may help explain why certain cognitive abilities are more vulnerable to aging and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lessons-from-gray-and-white-matter"&gt;Lessons from gray and white matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553239/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gray matter&lt;/a&gt; in the brain packed about fifty percent more mitochondria than &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abf3736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;white matter&lt;/a&gt;, and those mitochondria also generated energy with greater efficiency. That finding echoes earlier &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11024075/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; showing that the density of mitochondrial complex I correlates with IQ and processing speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because gray matter handles local computation while white matter relays long‑range signals, the split hints that thinking depends not just on how many mitochondria exist but also on how well they convert fuel into &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31985968/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ATP&lt;/a&gt;, the cell’s energy currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-linking-energy-to-mental-performance"&gt;Linking energy to mental performance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10526226/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that mitochondrial health strongly influences learning, attention, and emotional regulation. These traits rely on fast, flexible neural circuits that are especially sensitive to energy shortfalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regions like the prefrontal cortex, essential for decision-making and working memory, demand high levels of ATP to function properly. When mitochondria falter in these areas, even minor deficits can ripple outward into daily thinking and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-signals-for-aging-brains"&gt;Signals for aging brains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dysfunction of brain mitochondria is increasingly viewed as a driver of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39877373/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;neurodegenerative disorders&lt;/a&gt;; recent reviews tie impaired organelle dynamics to amyloid and tau build‑up in Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2317673121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; from Picard’s lab links psychosocial stress to shifts in the biology of brain mitochondria, suggesting lifestyle and environment may tweak the energetic landscape long before plaques appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By pinpointing where energy production runs thin, the new map could steer drug and behavioral trials toward the regions most likely to benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-toward-personalized-energy-profiles"&gt;Toward personalized energy profiles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early data hint that individual lifestyles (diet, sleep patterns, exercise) may leave distinct marks on each person’s brain energy map. Tracking those differences could guide tailored interventions long before clinical symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining the MitoBrainMap with wearable health trackers may reveal how daily habits shift brain mitochondrial performance in real time. That fusion of lab-grade &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-mapping-research-mouse-neurons-revolutionary-advance/"&gt;precision&lt;/a&gt; and personal monitoring opens the door to truly preventive brain care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team has already begun cataloging nine key regions in 500 additional brains to gauge variation across sex, ancestry, and disease history. If the patterns hold, future MRI scans may include an energy overlay that predicts who is at risk for memory lapses, years before they first arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08740-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 15:07:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPTFV3aVRaUTJxcTFjY3lsS01tdlY3UERBak05X0J0NUhiRnVWNHF3Tk1LQTc5ZG9ESGpOeE90VUVhYUlzenF6ZFdINVhBTFRhM011cjBFaVhyOVFRZnViUDVQRVVFdV95Ym1JWUd5ZmcwMmg1VE91LXNuRmpTN1Rnenp3RzdzdV9taW4waXF0cFJ3N2dnZUhOMUd3</guid></item><item><title>医生如何为RFK Jr.的疫苗政策转变做准备-第19期新闻 | How doctors are preparing for RFK Jr.’s shifts on vaccine policy - The 19th News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE1jbjI5V0NDZldwOTlJQVlraEhaLUxMU3hMU050Z2M5cVdxZ2FGTDhDeERJdEo1ZE8tcG1rNlp2RnpvTmpmYUIwcXM2ZWl5cVI2c2xQeWliTDE1cWlnUnR4c3ZVZ1VmcFpPZ3c0Qjk0NlphRkhzSUY4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenberg article-body-width js-hang-punc"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

        
                  
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to vaccines, there are two kinds of parents coming into Dr. Megan Prior’s office in Washington, D.C., these days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One set are parents who pepper the pediatrician with increasingly panicked questions about the future availability of vaccines and whether their children can get any shots early. Then there are the parents who feel vindicated in their decision not to vaccinate their kids, &lt;a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Weighing-the-Risks-and-Benefits.aspx"&gt;despite vaccines’ overall safety and record of disease prevention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s almost like I have these two groups of diverging patients, where some are really, really worried about their access and want to get things done as soon as possible,” she said. “And then others are sort of in this vaccine hesitant category.”&lt;/p&gt;

  

  
      
  




&lt;p&gt;Both groups have been spurred by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s HHS shakeups could have huge implications for vaccine policy in America. Earlier this month, he fired all 17 members of a key vaccine panel and replaced them with a smaller group of people who in some cases &lt;a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/06/rfk-jr-fires-vaccine-panel-replacements/"&gt;lack relevant experience and who, like him, have been skeptical of vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. He &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/rfk-jr-hhs-moves-to-restore-public-trust-in-vaccines-45495112"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; the vaccine panel firings were aimed at addressing members’ conflicts of interest, even though they worked under &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/ACIP-conflicts-interest-policy.pdf"&gt;a comprehensive policy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Physicians who treat both children and families say they’re frustrated with Kennedy’s unprecedented firing of the panel known as the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) — and they’re concerned about what it might mean for the future availability of safe and effective vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, doctors are figuring out as a medical community how they can keep their patients healthy with evidence-based guidelines. They’re turning to each other — through membership in trusted organizations that are taking joint actions — and figuring out how to give patients reliable information amid uncertainty about the government’s next steps.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ACIP’s review of vaccines and subsequent guidance, under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, helps insurance companies determine vaccine coverage. A change to ACIP recommendations could have the ripple effect of making a vaccine more expensive to obtain, or more difficult to access through doctors’ offices and pharmacies. The new panel has not taken any actions yet, but its members are scheduled to next week. Vaccine experts say they’re watching closely to see what policy changes, if any, might emerge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If I were a mom, and I’m thinking, ‘What do I do for my kid right now?’ I want to be confident that my primary care physician, my family doctor or my pediatrician was making recommendations based on what we know from science and not based on what the insurance company will or will not pay for, or what politics is saying,” said Dr. Jen Brull, a longtime family physician who is now president of &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/home.html"&gt;the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)&lt;/a&gt;. “I think it’s very safe to say that you can look to your primary care physician for that kind of recommendation, and that’s what you should be looking for.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prior, who has long used ACIP and CDC guidance on vaccines to answer questions from parents, said she recently downloaded a version of the current children’s vaccination schedule that includes recommendations made by the fired vaccine panel, “just in case there are any changes, so I can remember exactly how wording looked.” She is creating a list of trusted sources, including &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKC2kT9HsmA"&gt;the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)&lt;/a&gt; and AAFP, so she can monitor how they mirror or pivot from future government actions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other vaccine experts have announced their &lt;a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/cidrap-launches-vaccine-integrity-project"&gt;own initiative&lt;/a&gt; to protect the integrity of vaccine policy, information and access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Clearly, there’s a lot of us who are super interested in evidence-based science that will ensure that physicians and families have access to the right recommendations, no matter how politicized things get,” Prior said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Around the same time that news about Kennedy’s ACIP firings broke, hundreds of doctors were gathered in Chicago for a key meeting of &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/"&gt;the American Medical Association (AMA)&lt;/a&gt;, the largest association of physicians, representing more than 190 state and specialty medical societies. Within hours after the firings were public, Brull and representatives from several major medical groups drafted an &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/a25-emergency-1001.pdf"&gt;emergency resolution&lt;/a&gt; that called on Kennedy to reverse his actions on the vaccine panel and also requested a Senate investigation into the firings. The resolution passed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The emotion in the room was that everyone who was there cared about this — but we wanted to make sure that the AMA, that our individual organizations, were speaking truth,” Brull said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. David Higgins, a pediatrician and spokesperson for AAP, said the recent dismantling of expertise on ACIP threatens a clarity that has developed over decades within the medical community when it comes to vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AAP has been issuing vaccine guidance since 1935, nearly three decades before ACIP was created. To help reduce confusion, both entities officially began publishing harmonized guidance on vaccines in 1995. The consistency helped streamline care for families and reduced discrepancies as combination vaccines became more widely available, according to Higgins.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AAP still maintains its own expert review process for its vaccine schedule, and Higgins said the organization plans to keep issuing recommendations that are “grounded in science and committed to child health.” He worries about potentially conflicting recommendations in the future, and how that might raise public confusion and distrust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Parents we talk with are understandably anxious and unsure,” he said in an email. “Our parents and families have a lot of questions, and as pediatricians, we welcome those questions. Pediatricians want to partner with parents and meet them where they are with compassion, clarity, and credible information.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brull also wanted to emphasize that point from the lens of family physicians, who sometimes see generations of one family and can be a key source of evidence-based medical information, especially in rural areas with more limited health coverage options.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My foundational advice to parents and kids who are old enough to have these conversations on their own is that the best thing most people can do is reach out and talk to their primary care doctor — whether that’s their pediatrician or their family physician, and have a conversation,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prior, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/ittybittyrevolution/reels/"&gt;who shares her views on health policy news on social media&lt;/a&gt;, does not want to minimize the implications of ACIP’s new membership and what it could mean if they pull a safe vaccine from the immunization schedules for adults or children. She still distinctly remembers her constant worry about whether her young child could access a COVID-19 vaccine, and the transition to in-person schooling and re-entering more public spaces.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If we live in a world where &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-us-map/"&gt;measles is incredibly common&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/national-international/whooping-cough-pertussis-post-pandemic-pediatrician-vaccination/3759327/"&gt;whooping cough is incredibly common&lt;/a&gt;, where these really infectious diseases are just part of our lives again, parents will have to go through those decisions again,” she said. “I think that piece of it makes me so frustrated. I know how frustrating it was to be a parent in COVID, and I do not wish that stress on anyone.

              &lt;p&gt;Vaping might be safer than cigarette smoking, but they carry their own health risks. A New Jersey man’s electronic cigarette habit likely contributed to his fast-spreading, fatal lung cancer, his doctors say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors at the AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center in Atlantic City &lt;a href="https://amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/947911"&gt;detailed&lt;/a&gt; the tragic death this month in the American Journal of Case Reports. The 51-year-old former smoker and longtime vaper developed an aggressive lung cancer that killed him just months after diagnosis. Though a causative link isn’t confirmed, the authors say more studies are needed to figure out vaping’s cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the report, the man visited a local hospital sometime in 2020 after he started to cough up blood. During the prior month, he had also been experiencing symptoms of weight loss, chest discomfort, and shortness of breath. Tests soon revealed that he had a form of non-small cell lung carcinoma, specifically determined to be squamous cell carcinoma. The cancer had already started to spread and break off into pieces that reached the heart, making surgery unfeasible. He was discharged and quickly placed on chemotherapy, but to no avail. The man’s health continued to rapidly deteriorate and he died three months after his diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The man had a history of cigarette smoking, the equivalent of 10 pack-years (meaning he smoked roughly a pack a day for 10 years). But he told the doctors he quit in 2009 and switched exclusively to e-cigarettes for the next 11 years. He regularly received lung and heart check-ups, and his last chest X-ray two years earlier was normal, suggesting his cancer only recently emerged. Because of the aggressive and non-responsive nature of the cancer, his relatively young age (most cases are caught in people over 65) and the lack of recent cigarette use, the doctors suspect that vaping probably played a part in his death.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“While causality cannot be established, the case highlights a potential association between [vaping] and malignancy,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People have gotten seriously sick from vaping before, though usually under specific circumstances. In 2019, for instance, a mysterious lung disease that affected thousands of people in the U.S. was ultimately &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/what-ever-happened-to-the-vaping-lung-disease-1845750495"&gt;traced back&lt;/a&gt; to toxic additives primarily used in THC-containing vapes (while the initial outbreak did subside, these cases still &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/woman-hospitalized-with-covid-19-was-actually-suffering-1847362336"&gt;appear&lt;/a&gt; occasionally). Other chemicals used to flavor vapes have also &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/popcorn-lung-how-vaping-could-scar-your-lungs-for-life/"&gt;been tied&lt;/a&gt; to rare lung illnesses. But this appears to be one of the first case reports to explicitly link vaping and lung cancer. Other &lt;a href="https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/oral-carcinoma-associated-with-chronic-use-of-electronic-cigarettes-2161-119X-1000304.php?aid=88343"&gt;isolated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33926987/"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; have found a connection between vaping and mouth cancer. Some studies have also suggested that people who both vape and smoke (so-called dual users) have a &lt;a href="https://www.gavinpublishers.com/article/view/vaping-smoking-and-lung-cancer-risk"&gt;higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of lung cancer than people who only smoke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, the overall research to date doesn’t appear to &lt;a href="https://www.tobaccoinduceddiseases.org/Evidence-update-on-the-cancer-risk-of-vaping-e-cigarettes-A-systematic-review,192934,0,2.html#:~:text=No%20significant%20incident%20or%20prevalent%20risk%20of%20lung%20cancer%20or%20other%20types%20of%20cancer%20was%20found%20in%20the%20never%20smoker%20current%20vapers%20population."&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; a significant added risk of lung cancer among people who only vape and have never smoked. And studies have also long found that vaping is &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/better-health/quit-smoking/ready-to-quit-smoking/vaping-to-quit-smoking/vaping-myths-and-the-facts/#:~:text=Myth%201%3A%20Vaping%20is%20just%20as%20harmful%20as%20smoking&amp;amp;text=Nicotine%20vaping%20is%20not%20risk,of%20the%20risks%20of%20smoking%22."&gt;less harmful&lt;/a&gt; in general than smoking. Given that this case is only one anecdote, the doctors aren’t pushing for formal changes to screening guidelines just yet. But they are calling for further studies to untangle the unique dangers that vaping may pose.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

These symptoms, which can include exhaustion, difficulty concentrating, and muscle weakness, often begin within minutes to hours after orgasm and can persist for several days. Although the condition has been largely observed in men, there is growing, albeit limited, evidence that it may also affect women. A new scientific review published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12119-025-10372-x" target="_blank"&gt;Sexuality &amp;amp; Culture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; offers the most up-to-date summary of what is currently known about POIS, highlighting its symptoms, possible causes, and a wide range of treatment attempts—none of which has proven universally effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted the review because POIS remains an under-recognized condition with no established diagnostic criteria in medical manuals and no agreed-upon treatment approach. Since it was first described in 2002, only a handful of studies have attempted to systematically explore its causes and potential treatments. The review authors aimed to provide a clearer overview of the scientific literature to help both clinicians and patients better understand the condition and guide future research efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To carry out the review, the authors searched the PubMed database for articles with references to POIS in their titles, abstracts, or keywords. This initial search produced 429 results, which were then narrowed down to English-language studies published between 2020 and 2025. After removing irrelevant or duplicate entries, the authors were left with 29 articles that met their inclusion criteria. These papers formed the basis for their review of the latest knowledge surrounding POIS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors began by reviewing the symptoms and diagnostic criteria most commonly associated with POIS. Because the condition is not formally recognized by diagnostic systems like the International Classification of Diseases or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, researchers have had to rely on informal criteria. The most widely accepted standards were developed by Dutch psychiatrist Marcel Waldinger and his team, based on reports from 45 male patients. These criteria include flu-like symptoms such as fatigue, feverishness, and irritability; onset of symptoms shortly after ejaculation; recurrence in nearly every ejaculation; and a duration of symptoms typically lasting between two and seven days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later research has expanded upon these findings. In what remains the largest study of POIS to date, researcher Natale and colleagues in 2020 surveyed 302 men, 268 of whom met at least three of Waldinger’s diagnostic criteria. The most commonly reported symptoms were difficulty concentrating (reported by 84% of participants), extreme fatigue (83%), irritability (74%), and muscle weakness (70%). Many participants said they avoided sexual activity, masturbation, or even romantic relationships to prevent the debilitating symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While POIS has historically been viewed as a male-only condition, newer reports suggest it may also affect women. However, these cases are rare and under-documented, and more research is needed to understand how the condition manifests in female patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cause of POIS remains a subject of intense debate. Early studies proposed that it might be an allergic or autoimmune reaction to a person’s own semen. Waldinger’s research supported this hypothesis through allergy skin tests, which showed positive results in a large majority of POIS patients. A few case studies even documented successful treatment through desensitization therapy using diluted samples of the patient’s semen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet more recent studies have cast doubt on the allergic explanation. Some patients do not show typical allergy responses, and semen-specific antibodies are not always present. Other researchers have proposed alternative explanations, including the idea that POIS may stem from a chemical imbalance in the brain, a dysregulated immune or hormone response, or nervous system dysfunction. A particularly novel theory suggests that POIS results from minor nerve damage in the pelvic muscles responsible for ejaculation, similar to conditions that cause delayed muscle pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The varied and sometimes conflicting findings suggest that POIS may have multiple causes. Different patients may experience the condition due to different underlying mechanisms, making it difficult to define a one-size-fits-all explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to physical symptoms, POIS is frequently associated with mental health problems. Studies have reported high rates of depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder in those affected. One study found that 87.5% of POIS patients had at least one of these conditions. Another found a lower, but still significant, rate of 45%. Many individuals also experience premature ejaculation, likely due to low sexual activity or anxiety about triggering symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the exact cause of POIS remains unknown, treatment has been inconsistent and largely experimental. Doctors have tried a wide range of medications and therapies, targeting the suspected underlying causes. In the 2020 Natale study, some of the more commonly used medications included antihistamines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (commonly used to treat depression), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Of these, niacin and anti-inflammatory drugs appeared to be most effective for the highest number of participants, but still only helped a portion of those who tried them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other approaches have included hormone therapy, especially in men with low testosterone levels, and psychological interventions like relaxation techniques. A few cases have reported positive outcomes from desensitization therapy or immunotherapy. In one recent and unusual case, a man underwent surgery to block semen from interacting with immune cells in his body and reportedly saw his symptoms disappear. Another case reported improvement after undergoing a microbiota transplant to alter gut bacteria, though it’s unclear whether this treatment played a direct role in his recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the limited number of documented cases and the diversity in symptom expression and treatment outcomes, no official guidelines exist for treating POIS. Most medical professionals are unfamiliar with the condition, and some patients report difficulty discussing their symptoms due to embarrassment or stigma around sexual health. The authors of the review stress the need for personalized approaches to treatment and encourage clinicians to work closely with patients to identify potential triggers and helpful interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While earlier reviews on POIS exist, this new article includes a larger and more recent body of research. The authors recommend that POIS be considered for inclusion in formal disease classification systems like the ICD or DSM to promote awareness and improve clinical recognition. They also emphasize the importance of continuing to explore the condition in both men and women and testing treatment strategies in larger patient samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12119-025-10372-x" target="_blank"&gt;Postorgasmic Illness Syndrome: Insights from Recent Literature on a Rare but Fascinating Disorder&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Krystian Wdowiak, Agnieszka Maciocha, and Julia Wąż.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 14:05:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxNYl9zcllwS0JjV3hQc2xkR2ZwR2l4aWJHTHkxTXN2d0gzOEZDWTdGT0c0dEEyNUdObE1IZ0VMZEt6TEFHU2p6S1U4bVEwV1VmdVg5dmJfb1lJTHVGeTlXTHNhcXY5bnpyb0FNMjdhVlNqR09NMGZfZzlpNGtWZmxKdVFUa3NsekhNMDliY2FJeTFxR1RaZW1uamxDOVlQRXlKUFNESWhvcnI4RkdUdF92a3hrSXQ3MUk4WHBRRkc0OTQyVV9NVUFV</guid></item><item><title>肾脏健康和不安腿综合征解释：症状、原因和治愈方法-印度时报 | Kidney health and Restless Legs Syndrome explained: Symptoms, causes, and cure - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study has identified chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients—especially those undergoing dialysis—as a group at significantly higher risk of developing Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). The research highlights that RLS symptoms are highly prevalent in this population and are closely associated with iron deficiency, a condition frequently seen in CKD due to chronic inflammation, poor dietary intake, and blood loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2016 meta-analysis found that nearly one in four CKD patients experiences RLS, with higher rates among those on hemodialysis. Further, brain imaging and cerebrospinal fluid studies have shown lower iron concentrations in certain areas in RLS patients, suggesting that central, rather than peripheral, iron deficiency is more relevant to symptom development. In CKD, this imbalance is often worsened by dialysis-related blood loss and systemic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study further noted that CKD patients with RLS had lower levels of serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and serum iron, along with elevated TIBC, pointing to both absolute and functional iron deficiency. These findings underscore the importance of early detection and iron-targeted therapy in managing RLS symptoms and improving overall quality of life in CKD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What is Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restless Legs Syndrome—also called Willis-Ekbom Disease—is a neurological and sensory condition characterized by an uncontrollable urge to move the legs. It typically occurs during periods of rest or inactivity, especially in the evening or at night, making it a sleep-disrupting disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition tends to worsen in the evening and improves with movement. People often describe the sensations as aching, itching, throbbing, crawling, or pulling in the legs. Though it mostly affects the legs, it can occasionally impact the arms too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Signs and symptoms of RLS&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RLS symptoms can range from mild to severe and vary from person to person. Some of its key features include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discomfort after resting: Symptoms typically start when you're sitting or lying down for long periods, for example during a long drive, or while watching a move in a theatre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relief with movement: Stretching, pacing, or leg simple movement helps temporarily improve the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worse at night: Many experience trouble falling or staying asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Night time twitching: RLS may be associated with another, more common condition called periodic limb movement of sleep, wherein the legs twitch and kick during sleep, possibly throughout the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Impact on mood and focus: Chronic fatigue, depression, and difficulty concentrating are common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In severe cases, RLS symptoms occur more than twice a week and can interfere with work, social life, and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What causes RLS?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, there's no known cause for restless legs syndrome. However several contributing factors have been identified. Genetics appear to play a role, as RLS often runs in families. One of the most significant medical links is iron deficiency, especially low levels of iron in the brain, which interferes with dopamine production—an essential chemical for smooth muscle control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;RLS is also frequently seen in people with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, kidney disease, and peripheral neuropathy. Additionally, problems in the brain’s dopamine pathways, similar to those seen in Parkinson’s disease, have been associated with RLS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Managing RLS: What helps?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently there is no cure for RLS but its symptoms can often be managed with the right combination of treatment and lifestyle adjustments. The first step towards tackling the issue is to address and acknowledge underlying conditions like iron deficiency, diabetes, or sleep apnea. People with RLS are often advised to avoid or limit their intake of caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine, especially in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to reduce the nighttime symptoms, it has been observed that Creating a regular sleep routine and maintaining a calming bedtime environment has a positive effect on the body. Further, warm baths, leg massages, or the use of heating pads and ice packs also give relief. Some devices like vibration pads or specially designed foot wraps that apply gentle pressure have also proved to provide temporary relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 13:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>与其担心体重，不如专注于避免脆弱性- CNN | Instead of worrying about your weight, focus on avoiding fragility - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNWk4zUEtUWUlneWNCNXFQZ0V4SkFiQTdLS3FUSEdYdXA4M2djcjlxQS1ZdlROdkZlUWJHTzhzVjVES3lZOWtMSERrTDVqcW8zTnNXRW9aVU4yZUt5ZnZCQ0c5aDBHTHFSOXBGWGxLdjVwNWVfS0MzYjVTeXJLamZoQ3d0eUpuME5xaENN0gGQAUFVX3lxTE15LUhRdF95QjdlZTVGbUJ1VFNUSG1zeXBEeVFGcFNyZi1SbWZwcnMtbkhqZEtudE5rMzB4M1llNFY1dkkyOHppLTJfYmZ2cVZLaVVqT0c4TGxJMTV3SW5XR0tQZS02bnF4eUpKQ3pmSHQ3Yks3RXlrZlpVbVhEdWUwUXVjX2c2RmRrWlhoeXE0RA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Anti-aging aspirations have turned longevity products and services into a wellness-industry gold mine. But who wants to add on years only to spend them struggling to move, dependent on others and unable to enjoy basic activities?
    &lt;/p&gt;

            What’s the point of sticking around longer if you can’t actually live life? Building and maintaining strength and mobility helps preserve the independence you need to age with dignity — and the actions you take now make all the difference.

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the biggest misconception about bone and joint health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621000v3b6mvm03x13d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Jocelyn Wittstein: &lt;/strong&gt;Most people don’t realize that bone mineral density (BMD) peaks at around age 30. After that, your goal is to maintain your BMD and try to slow down bone loss. For women, bone density &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31021891/" target="_blank"&gt;decreases&lt;/a&gt; about 1% annually until menopause and then accelerates to 2% a year. Men experience a roughly 1% annual decline. The key is to build a strong foundation early and continue supporting your bone and joint health throughout your life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621000w3b6mzea656u8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another misconception is that cardiovascular exercise alone is enough to preserve mobility, but strength training and light impact exercises are critical, too. These activities can elevate the peak bone density of people in their teens and 20s, while people older than 30 need those same exercises to minimize loss.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc3y05ur00043b6mtieyy2a9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is important considering that &lt;a href="https://www.arthritis.org/advocate/federal/research-for-a-cure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;1 in 4 adults&lt;/a&gt; will get osteoarthritis, and anyone older than&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;age 50 has a heightened risk for both arthritis and osteoporosis, women in particular. A full 77% of postmenopausal women reported joint pain in a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23511705/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;randomized study&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621000x3b6mnr511tab@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Sydney Nitzkorski:&lt;/strong&gt; As a dietitian, I find that people don’t think enough about how much calcium they’re taking in, and most people are not getting enough. Your body can’t make the calcium it needs, not just for bones and teeth but also heart, muscle and nerve function. If you’re not consuming enough, your body will raid the reserves in your skeleton to meet its requirements.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621000y3b6ma9tbjh27@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is why everybody, at every age, needs to get enough calcium. If you have kids, make sure they’re consuming enough now, because this is when they’re building bone mass. But sufficient calcium is still important even if you’re 60 or beyond. Boosting your bone health is incredibly important at every age, and it’s never too late to start taking proactive steps.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621000z3b6mqid02vjl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Are calcium supplements necessary?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk62100103b6mo5oppd4l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Nitzkorski:&lt;/strong&gt; Whole foods are the best sources for calcium, with supplementation as a secondary option. I recommend that people track their intake for a typical week and then adjust accordingly. Adults need 1,000 to 1,200 milligrams of &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/calcium-supplements/art-20047097" target="_blank"&gt;calcium daily&lt;/a&gt;. Good sources include milk, fortified plant milks, broccoli and kale, as well as sardines and anchovies because you eat the bones.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk62100113b6mp5399103@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wittstein: &lt;/strong&gt;Plus bok choy, which I consider a superfood. It’s the green vegetable with the highest bioavailability of calcium. The calcium your body gets from a food depends on two factors: the total calcium the food contains and the bioavailability of that calcium, or how well the body absorbs and uses the mineral.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;A cup of milk has 300 milligrams of calcium that is 30% bioavailable, while a cup of bok choy has 160 milligrams that is 55% bioavailable. Yet, each one provides the body with an equivalent amount of calcium: about 87.5 milligrams. Along with bok choy’s excellent calcium bioavailability, it also provides fiber and vitamins A and C. I love to prepare this green vegetable superfood with garlic, ginger and olive oil, making it an excellent anti-inflammatory food for joints and overall health.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Pressing question: Can we count the calcium from milk in coffee?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk62100133b6mowr2wq1o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Nitzkorski:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes! In the book, Jocelyn and I share that we both nail our calcium targets by drinking a lot of milk with a little bit of coffee. It’s true that consuming more than 300 milligrams per day of caffeine lowers your body’s calcium absorption — but that’s a high bar when you consider an 8-ounce cup of coffee contains around 100 milligrams and a double shot of espresso contains about 140 milligrams.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wittstein: &lt;/strong&gt;Milk, whether it’s from cows or a plant-based type that’s been supplemented, is a good source of vitamin D, too. We know that consuming 2,000 IU of vitamin D a day can benefit bone health and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28797917/" target="_blank"&gt;may help decrease joint pain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. When it comes to coffee, people are often glad to learn that it is rich in anti-inflammatory antioxidants. It contains the polyphenol quercetin, which &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27710596/" target="_blank"&gt;may help alleviate pain a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;nd &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10384403/" target="_blank"&gt;has anti-inflammatory properties&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk62100153b6m39rigjvu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I like to add cinnamon to my coffee for added anti-inflammatory effect and glucose control. You can also add whey protein — which provides amino acids that your body uses to build muscle — and/or collagen supplements, which can improve both &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34520654/" target="_blank"&gt;bone density&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30368550/" target="_blank"&gt;joint pain&lt;/a&gt;, depending on the type.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What’s the connection between inflammation and joint health?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk62100173b6mq3hwilxd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wittstein: &lt;/strong&gt;Inflammation can break down cartilage and contribute to joint pain. Chronic inflammation accelerates joint deterioration. Anti-inflammatory nutrition taken in through diet and supplements like omega-3 fatty acids and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/11/health/turmeric-indigestion-wellness"&gt;curcumin&lt;/a&gt;, for example, can help ease symptoms like pain and swelling.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What does an anti-inflammatory diet look like?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk62100193b6mkllf1z57@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Nitzkorski:&lt;/strong&gt; What I love about recommending anti-inflammatory foods is that they provide so many other benefits, too, such as decreasing &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/02/health/anti-inflammatory-foods-heart-disease-wellness"&gt;heart attack risk&lt;/a&gt;, increasing longevity, improving digestion and giving you more energy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621001a3b6mcc7ukz1f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An anti-inflammatory diet is rich in lean proteins, which could be animal-based — such as non- or low-fat dairy, eggs, fish, chicken or turkey — or plant-based like beans, lentils and soy as well as pea proteins, which are found in a lot of protein powders. An anti-inflammatory diet also includes healthy fats, such as olive oil and foods containing omega-3 fatty acids like fish as well as walnuts and flax, chia and basil seeds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621001b3b6mkqgpii31@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Alliums — including garlic, onion, leeks and shallots — are flavorful plants that have multiple anti-inflammatory properties. And there’s a whole spectrum of spices including turmeric, cayenne, black pepper and ginger.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621001c3b6mjkk947um@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wittstein: &lt;/strong&gt;Also important is dietary fiber from fruits, vegetables, beans and whole grains that provides short-chain fatty acids, higher levels of which are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30971437/" target="_blank"&gt;associated&lt;/a&gt; with lower levels of inflammation. Fruits and vegetables also contain myriad anti-inflammatory phytochemicals — naturally occurring compounds that provide an array of health benefits.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621001d3b6mboej8kxm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Avoiding or limiting inflammatory ingredients like processed meats, red meat, fried foods, saturated fats and processed carbohydrates is also important.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621001e3b6mww719jk8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What types of exercise promote bone and joint health?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621001f3b6mlzouzx0j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wittstein: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s critical to incorporate resistance training and impact exercises. The goal is to work into your 150 minutes of weekly activity a combination of the following: three days of weight-bearing aerobic exercise, two days of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28975661/" target="_blank"&gt;resistance training&lt;/a&gt;, and two days of balance work and light-impact exercises.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621001g3b6m8dqc3aih@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That might sound like a lot, but these don’t have to be long, intense sessions, and several of these types of conditioning can be combined. Standing on one leg and doing an overhead press counts as resistance training as well as balance work, for example. There are multiple things we want you to do to stimulate your bones and your muscles in different ways, but some of these activities can count as two.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621001h3b6mpbufmv5c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Nitzkorski:&lt;/strong&gt; You can also integrate little exercises into your daily life. Just as we lose muscle and bone mass with age, we also lose our ability to balance. Practice intentionally throwing yourself off balance a little bit so your body must work to find its equilibrium again.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621001i3b6m5k0dq7am@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Stand on one foot while brushing your teeth. Instead of sitting while watching TV, stand on one leg. Pretend a paintbrush is strapped to your toe and try to write your name or the alphabet. Write A through M on your right leg, and then switch and do N through Z on your left. To work on muscular endurance, do little arm circles. These start out super easy, but if you do them for two or three minutes it becomes exhausting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621001j3b6m3ih4ihgn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What do you mean by light-impact exercises?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621001k3b6mnfjagdne@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wittstein: &lt;/strong&gt;These include small jumps, jumping jacks or jumping rope. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23948830/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; show that doing 10 to 50 jumps three times a week is enough to stimulate your bone density. I encourage people to weave them into their day. By doing a little bit of hopping while you’re waiting for the bus, you’re getting your heart rate up and getting in some light-impact conditioning.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621001l3b6mwvnp6kts@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Do you recommend jumping if it causes knee pain?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621001m3b6mk2g4uk05@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Nitzkorski:&lt;/strong&gt; No, people should listen to their joint pain! If jumping hurts your knees, focus on other kinds of conditioning like shallow squats, for example. You can also spread out your jumps over the course of the day or a week so you are not doing too many in a row. Or you can modify jumping exercises by using the back of a chair, or something else, for balance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621001n3b6mwbi707cz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wittstein: &lt;/strong&gt;Or try modifications like pool jumping, which adds resistance and partly reduces impact. Water-based exercises are not as effective as land-based jumping exercises, but they are definitely beneficial for bone mineral density.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621001o3b6mwvbmkqhl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the gains from some of these exercise-based interventions may seem small, they actually translate to big risk reductions. We know from &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30674078/" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; of pharmaceutical interventions that a 2% increase in lumbar-spine-bone density reduces spine fracture risk by 28%. A 4% improvement in hip-bone density decreases hip fracture risk by 32%. So even small improvements matter significantly.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Nitzkorski:&lt;/strong&gt; Absolutely not. While it’s ideal to start early, you can always benefit from improving your diet and exercise routine. Start small — even 10 minutes of activity is better than nothing. Over time, small dietary changes can become a habit that sticks. The goal is consistency and gradual improvement so you can enjoy the life you live for that much longer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Anti-aging aspirations have turned longevity products and services into a wellness-industry gold mine. But who wants to add on years only to spend them struggling to move, dependent on others and unable to enjoy basic activities?
    &lt;/p&gt;

            What’s the point of sticking around longer if you can’t actually live life? Building and maintaining strength and mobility helps preserve the independence you need to age with dignity — and the actions you take now make all the difference.

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the biggest misconception about bone and joint health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621000v3b6mvm03x13d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Jocelyn Wittstein: &lt;/strong&gt;Most people don’t realize that bone mineral density (BMD) peaks at around age 30. After that, your goal is to maintain your BMD and try to slow down bone loss. For women, bone density &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31021891/" target="_blank"&gt;decreases&lt;/a&gt; about 1% annually until menopause and then accelerates to 2% a year. Men experience a roughly 1% annual decline. The key is to build a strong foundation early and continue supporting your bone and joint health throughout your life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621000w3b6mzea656u8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another misconception is that cardiovascular exercise alone is enough to preserve mobility, but strength training and light impact exercises are critical, too. These activities can elevate the peak bone density of people in their teens and 20s, while people older than 30 need those same exercises to minimize loss.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc3y05ur00043b6mtieyy2a9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is important considering that &lt;a href="https://www.arthritis.org/advocate/federal/research-for-a-cure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;1 in 4 adults&lt;/a&gt; will get osteoarthritis, and anyone older than&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;age 50 has a heightened risk for both arthritis and osteoporosis, women in particular. A full 77% of postmenopausal women reported joint pain in a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23511705/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;randomized study&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621000x3b6mnr511tab@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Sydney Nitzkorski:&lt;/strong&gt; As a dietitian, I find that people don’t think enough about how much calcium they’re taking in, and most people are not getting enough. Your body can’t make the calcium it needs, not just for bones and teeth but also heart, muscle and nerve function. If you’re not consuming enough, your body will raid the reserves in your skeleton to meet its requirements.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621000y3b6ma9tbjh27@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is why everybody, at every age, needs to get enough calcium. If you have kids, make sure they’re consuming enough now, because this is when they’re building bone mass. But sufficient calcium is still important even if you’re 60 or beyond. Boosting your bone health is incredibly important at every age, and it’s never too late to start taking proactive steps.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621000z3b6mqid02vjl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Are calcium supplements necessary?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk62100103b6mo5oppd4l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Nitzkorski:&lt;/strong&gt; Whole foods are the best sources for calcium, with supplementation as a secondary option. I recommend that people track their intake for a typical week and then adjust accordingly. Adults need 1,000 to 1,200 milligrams of &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/calcium-supplements/art-20047097" target="_blank"&gt;calcium daily&lt;/a&gt;. Good sources include milk, fortified plant milks, broccoli and kale, as well as sardines and anchovies because you eat the bones.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk62100113b6mp5399103@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wittstein: &lt;/strong&gt;Plus bok choy, which I consider a superfood. It’s the green vegetable with the highest bioavailability of calcium. The calcium your body gets from a food depends on two factors: the total calcium the food contains and the bioavailability of that calcium, or how well the body absorbs and uses the mineral.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;A cup of milk has 300 milligrams of calcium that is 30% bioavailable, while a cup of bok choy has 160 milligrams that is 55% bioavailable. Yet, each one provides the body with an equivalent amount of calcium: about 87.5 milligrams. Along with bok choy’s excellent calcium bioavailability, it also provides fiber and vitamins A and C. I love to prepare this green vegetable superfood with garlic, ginger and olive oil, making it an excellent anti-inflammatory food for joints and overall health.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk62100123b6m5vt3rruz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Pressing question: Can we count the calcium from milk in coffee?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk62100133b6mowr2wq1o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Nitzkorski:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes! In the book, Jocelyn and I share that we both nail our calcium targets by drinking a lot of milk with a little bit of coffee. It’s true that consuming more than 300 milligrams per day of caffeine lowers your body’s calcium absorption — but that’s a high bar when you consider an 8-ounce cup of coffee contains around 100 milligrams and a double shot of espresso contains about 140 milligrams.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk62100143b6muyfolm8h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wittstein: &lt;/strong&gt;Milk, whether it’s from cows or a plant-based type that’s been supplemented, is a good source of vitamin D, too. We know that consuming 2,000 IU of vitamin D a day can benefit bone health and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28797917/" target="_blank"&gt;may help decrease joint pain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. When it comes to coffee, people are often glad to learn that it is rich in anti-inflammatory antioxidants. It contains the polyphenol quercetin, which &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27710596/" target="_blank"&gt;may help alleviate pain a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;nd &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10384403/" target="_blank"&gt;has anti-inflammatory properties&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk62100153b6m39rigjvu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I like to add cinnamon to my coffee for added anti-inflammatory effect and glucose control. You can also add whey protein — which provides amino acids that your body uses to build muscle — and/or collagen supplements, which can improve both &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34520654/" target="_blank"&gt;bone density&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30368550/" target="_blank"&gt;joint pain&lt;/a&gt;, depending on the type.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wittstein: &lt;/strong&gt;Inflammation can break down cartilage and contribute to joint pain. Chronic inflammation accelerates joint deterioration. Anti-inflammatory nutrition taken in through diet and supplements like omega-3 fatty acids and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/11/health/turmeric-indigestion-wellness"&gt;curcumin&lt;/a&gt;, for example, can help ease symptoms like pain and swelling.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk62100183b6mvtsvyihp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Nitzkorski:&lt;/strong&gt; What I love about recommending anti-inflammatory foods is that they provide so many other benefits, too, such as decreasing &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/02/health/anti-inflammatory-foods-heart-disease-wellness"&gt;heart attack risk&lt;/a&gt;, increasing longevity, improving digestion and giving you more energy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621001a3b6mcc7ukz1f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An anti-inflammatory diet is rich in lean proteins, which could be animal-based — such as non- or low-fat dairy, eggs, fish, chicken or turkey — or plant-based like beans, lentils and soy as well as pea proteins, which are found in a lot of protein powders. An anti-inflammatory diet also includes healthy fats, such as olive oil and foods containing omega-3 fatty acids like fish as well as walnuts and flax, chia and basil seeds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621001b3b6mkqgpii31@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Alliums — including garlic, onion, leeks and shallots — are flavorful plants that have multiple anti-inflammatory properties. And there’s a whole spectrum of spices including turmeric, cayenne, black pepper and ginger.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621001c3b6mjkk947um@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wittstein: &lt;/strong&gt;Also important is dietary fiber from fruits, vegetables, beans and whole grains that provides short-chain fatty acids, higher levels of which are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30971437/" target="_blank"&gt;associated&lt;/a&gt; with lower levels of inflammation. Fruits and vegetables also contain myriad anti-inflammatory phytochemicals — naturally occurring compounds that provide an array of health benefits.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621001d3b6mboej8kxm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Avoiding or limiting inflammatory ingredients like processed meats, red meat, fried foods, saturated fats and processed carbohydrates is also important.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wittstein: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s critical to incorporate resistance training and impact exercises. The goal is to work into your 150 minutes of weekly activity a combination of the following: three days of weight-bearing aerobic exercise, two days of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28975661/" target="_blank"&gt;resistance training&lt;/a&gt;, and two days of balance work and light-impact exercises.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621001g3b6m8dqc3aih@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That might sound like a lot, but these don’t have to be long, intense sessions, and several of these types of conditioning can be combined. Standing on one leg and doing an overhead press counts as resistance training as well as balance work, for example. There are multiple things we want you to do to stimulate your bones and your muscles in different ways, but some of these activities can count as two.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621001h3b6mpbufmv5c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Nitzkorski:&lt;/strong&gt; You can also integrate little exercises into your daily life. Just as we lose muscle and bone mass with age, we also lose our ability to balance. Practice intentionally throwing yourself off balance a little bit so your body must work to find its equilibrium again.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621001i3b6m5k0dq7am@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Stand on one foot while brushing your teeth. Instead of sitting while watching TV, stand on one leg. Pretend a paintbrush is strapped to your toe and try to write your name or the alphabet. Write A through M on your right leg, and then switch and do N through Z on your left. To work on muscular endurance, do little arm circles. These start out super easy, but if you do them for two or three minutes it becomes exhausting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What do you mean by light-impact exercises?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621001k3b6mnfjagdne@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wittstein: &lt;/strong&gt;These include small jumps, jumping jacks or jumping rope. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23948830/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; show that doing 10 to 50 jumps three times a week is enough to stimulate your bone density. I encourage people to weave them into their day. By doing a little bit of hopping while you’re waiting for the bus, you’re getting your heart rate up and getting in some light-impact conditioning.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Do you recommend jumping if it causes knee pain?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621001m3b6mk2g4uk05@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Nitzkorski:&lt;/strong&gt; No, people should listen to their joint pain! If jumping hurts your knees, focus on other kinds of conditioning like shallow squats, for example. You can also spread out your jumps over the course of the day or a week so you are not doing too many in a row. Or you can modify jumping exercises by using the back of a chair, or something else, for balance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621001n3b6mwbi707cz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wittstein: &lt;/strong&gt;Or try modifications like pool jumping, which adds resistance and partly reduces impact. Water-based exercises are not as effective as land-based jumping exercises, but they are definitely beneficial for bone mineral density.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc2hk621001o3b6mwvbmkqhl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the gains from some of these exercise-based interventions may seem small, they actually translate to big risk reductions. We know from &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30674078/" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; of pharmaceutical interventions that a 2% increase in lumbar-spine-bone density reduces spine fracture risk by 28%. A 4% improvement in hip-bone density decreases hip fracture risk by 32%. So even small improvements matter significantly.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Nitzkorski:&lt;/strong&gt; Absolutely not. While it’s ideal to start early, you can always benefit from improving your diet and exercise routine. Start small — even 10 minutes of activity is better than nothing. Over time, small dietary changes can become a habit that sticks. The goal is consistency and gradual improvement so you can enjoy the life you live for that much longer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

The disease can cause anxiety, confusion and short-term memory loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study focused on middle-aged adults who did not work night shifts and had no major health problems at the outset. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This helped to rule out other explanations for excessive daytime sleepiness and suggesting that the link with earlier death may not simply be due to existing illness or lifestyle factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants' sleep was assessed over a week-long period, using actigraphy—a method for monitoring a person's sleep-wake patterns using a small, watch-like device called an actigraph. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Daytime napping was defined as sleep between 9am and 7pm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On average, participants napped for around 24 minutes, with approximately a third of naps taken in the morning, between 9 and 11am. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During a follow-up period of 11 years, 5,189 of the participants died and overall, researchers noted that as people got older, they slept for longer later in the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After adjusting for potentially confounding lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol use and nighttime sleep duration, results showed that a less consistent napping routine was associated with a 14 per cent increased risk of mortality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists found the highest risk of death was seen in people who slept for the longest during the day, with people who nap between 11am and 1pm experiencing a seven per cent increased risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Around 900,000 Britons are currently thought to have the memory-robbing disorder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead researcher, Professor Chenlu Gao, from Harvard Medical School, said: 'Our study fills a gap in knowledge by showing that it's not just whether someone naps but how long, how variable, and when they nap may be meaningful indicators of future health risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While many studies have examined the links between sleep and mortality, they have largely focused on nighttime sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, napping is an important component of the 24-hour-sleep-wake cycle and may carry its own health implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our findings suggest that certain patterns of napping could serve as early indications of declining health.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers warned that further research is needed to better understand the biological pathways underlying these associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They noted that longer or more irregular naps could reflect underlying health problems such as heart disease, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14365571/Coffee-reduce-type-2-diabetes.html"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, depression and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other studies suggest the explanation may lie with the impact on our circadian rhythms—the natural sleep-wake cycles that determine a host of bodily functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts, from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, also argued that being asleep during the daytime could impact the brain's ability to clear waste that builds up during the day. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings come after a landmark study last year suggested almost half of all cases of Alzheimer's disease—the most common cause of dementia—could be prevented by tackling 14 lifestyle factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These included hearing loss, high cholesterol, vision loss and lack of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts claimed the study, published in the prestigious journal The Lancet, provided more hope than 'ever before' that the disorder that blights the lives of millions can be prevented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's Disease affects 982,000 people in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's Research UK analysis found 74,261 people died from dementia in 2022 compared with 69,178 a year earlier, making it the country's biggest killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 2019 estimate put the annual death toll at 70,000 people a year with the health issues caused costing the NHS £700million each year to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The WHO puts the annual global death toll from physical inactivity at around 2million per year, making it in the running to be among the top 10 leading causes of global death and disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Lots of people still take it, despite studies showing it can increase your mortality rate—this is any multivitamin supplement'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They [multivitamins] often have more than 100 per cent of the recommended daily allowances for all your vitamins and minerals which can be dangerous.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS says most people should get all the nutrients they need by having a varied and balanced diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average male adult needs around 700 micrograms (µg) of vitamin A a day, and women 600µg, according to the health service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But some multivitamins sold on the high street can &lt;span&gt;contain a much higher dose at 800µg per tablet. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unlike other supplements that are difficult to overdose on, as excess comes out in your urine, multivitamins containing higher levels of vitamin A and vitamin K could also remain in the body as they're fat soluble.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Ahmed &lt;/span&gt;said: 'For things like vitamin A and vitamin K which are fat soluble it can be quite dangerous and potentially in the long term can lead to liver failure, bone problems, and even bleeding and blood clot disorders.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fat soluble vitamins can accumulate in the body over time in the liver and fatty tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If consumed in excess, however, this can&lt;span&gt; weaken the bones, and damage the kidney and the heart.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The NHS says most people should get all the nutrients they need by having a varied and balanced diet &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Taking vitamin D at high doses for an extended period of time can also cause complications like hypercalcemia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is where excess calcium is deposited into the bloodstream, increasing the risk of heart and kidney disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ahmed advised people who are worried they are not getting enough essential vitamins and minerals to take one specific supplement for their needs—for example, vitamin D supplements too boost bone health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ahmed also said a healthy balanced diet that includes lots of oily fish, fortified foods and fibre is the best way to get all the essential vitamins the body needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'One thing that is fantastic that I take every day is a seed mixture,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I get the milled version, where they take out the hard shell, to help with digestion and some say it can also increase the nutrient absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is super high in fibre and protein and its got so many minerals and vitamins in it as well. It's a food not a supplement so this is probably the best way to make sure you get all the trace elements you need in your diet,' he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as the latest official figures show the number of Brits being hospitalised for malnutrition and nutritional deficiencies has almost tripled in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2022, there were more than 800,000 admissions in England and Wales with conditions linked to poor nutrition, including 'Victorian' illnesses scurvy and rickets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iron deficiency was the biggest problem, NHS data revealed, with admissions for the bone-weakening condition shooting up by 149 per cent since 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other research has, however, shown that multivitamins may serve no real health benefits.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2018, a major study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that the most popular supplements — multivitamins, vitamin D, calcium, and vitamin C — made no difference to the risk of heart disease, stroke or early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Folate — found in leafy greens and eggs — and other B-vitamins were seen to offer some reduced risk of heart disease, although the authors noted that the evidence for this was 'low to moderate quality'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 12:38:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Ashwagandha的5种潜在严重副作用- Verywell Health | 5 Potential Serious Side Effects of Ashwagandha - Verywell Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE1XSzlOVlBwNkFnTWpvU01BQTZ6eUpSbG1FTzdYUF82MTFCZG5RMTJDZE04Z2JCYldhcmdLakNLXzJUX3JaUFA2ZFk5bjk4TldIWE5VOUZmWmtVcTlhQ0dfeThiQjQyUnhybklZMmJ5VW5TUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="health-sc-page_1-0" class="comp health-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content article-content expert-content right-rail__offset lock-journey" data-sc-sticky-offset="60" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[400, 1400, 1400, 1700, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ashwagandha provides many benefits that affect both your physical and mental health, and it’s been used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine. While ashwagandha supplements are generally well-tolerated, there are some potentially serious side effects to know before taking them.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The most dangerous side effect of ashwagandha supplements you should be aware of is liver injury.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “There is increasing recognition of herb-induced liver injury associated with ashwagandha, particularly with prolonged use,” &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-abazia-5abab610/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Daniel T. Abazia, PharmD, BCPS, CPPS&lt;/a&gt;, clinical associate professor at the Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy at Rutgers Health, told Verywell.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “While most cases resolve after discontinuation, severe outcomes—including acute-on-chronic liver failure and death in patients with pre-existing liver disease—have been reported,” he added.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since the long-term safety of ashwagandha is unknown, it is recommended to supplement for no longer than three months, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samantha-dieras-dcn-rd-cdn-cdces-a6470068/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Samantha Dieras, DCN, RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, director of ambulatory nutrition services at Mount Sinai Health System, told Verywell.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This may not be surprising since ashwagandha has been linked to improved sleep quality, but somnolence, or a state of drowsiness or sleepiness, is a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/ashwagandha-benefits-for-women-8776598" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;common side effect of ashwagandha supplements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Though the effect is usually mild, it’s good to keep in mind that you may feel a little more fatigued than normal after starting the supplements, Abazia said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s rare, but ashwagandha supplements may cause vomiting for some people, according to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zumpano-julia-4757482a/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Julia Zumpano, RD&lt;/a&gt;, a dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your chances of getting sick may rise if you take more than the recommended amount of the supplements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ashwagandha supplements can also affect your bathroom habits. “Loose stool is among the most common mild and transient adverse effects” of ashwaganda supplements, Abazia said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ashwagandha supplements may cause direct irritation to the intestinal mucosa, which could lead to stomach upset in some people.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some people experience nausea when taking ashwagandha supplements, but most of the time it remains mild.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Nausea is one of the less common side effects associated with ashwagandha, Abazia said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ashwagandha supplements can be &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/these-supplements-can-interfere-with-your-medications-7501468" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dangerous to people who take certain medications&lt;/a&gt; or live with certain health conditions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Patients with pre-existing chronic liver disease are at highest risk for developing serious adverse effects, including herb-induced liver injury, with long-term or high-dose use of ashwagandha supplements,” Abazia said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before taking ashwagandha supplements, you should speak with a pharmacist about your other medications to ensure you won’t experience any dangerous reactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Ashwagandha is known to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/immunosuppressants-4846160" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;interact with immunosuppressants&lt;/a&gt;, sedative medications, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/thyroid-disease-medications-3231845" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;thyroid medications&lt;/a&gt;, and diabetes medications,” Dieras said. Pregnant women should also avoid ashwagandha, as should men with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, she added.

(Some others include wearing long sleeves, pants and hats; and trying to stay in the shade.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0deb5e" class="body-graf"&gt;There are a lot of &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/skin-beauty/types-of-sunscreen-rcna29080" target="_blank"&gt;types of sunscreen&lt;/a&gt; out there. You can even buy &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/shop/best-korean-sunscreens-rcna212417" target="_blank"&gt;sunscreens from other countries&lt;/a&gt; with different formulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f9f545" class="body-graf"&gt;The two main types of sunscreen, categorized by the mechanism they use to block UV rays, are physical and &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/skin-beauty/are-chemical-sunscreens-safe-rcna168630" target="_blank"&gt;chemical sunscreens&lt;/a&gt;. When buying one, you should prioritize anything with SPF 30 or higher — as well as one other attribute that many people forget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-15367b" class="body-heading"&gt;Dermatologist Tip of the Day: Look for Broad Spectrum, Not Just SPF, on Sunscreen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-feb287" class="body-graf"&gt;There are two types of UV rays emitted by the sun that humans on Earth exposed to — UVA and UVB, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/radiation-health/features/uv-radiation.html" target="_blank"&gt;per the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9cf3c8" class="body-graf"&gt;“Technically, SPF only really refers to UVB protection, but both UVB and UVA rays are dangerous,” Dr. Sandra Lee, board-certified dermatologist and cosmetic surgeon also known as Dr. Pimple Popper, &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/skin-beauty/summer-skin-care-tips-myths-dermatologist-rcna88360" target="_blank"&gt;said on TODAY.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5c80cb" class="body-graf"&gt;So, to know that your sunscreen is blocking UVA rays, too, "you really want to look at broad-spectrum protection, (which) means it is blocking UVB and UVA rays," Lee explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-33baca" class="body-heading"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-402d1a" class="body-graf"&gt;UVA and UVB have different effects on the skin. UVA more commonly causes tanning and aging signs, like wrinkles, whereas UVB mostly leads to sunburn, &lt;a href="https://www.skincancer.org/risk-factors/uv-radiation/" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Skin Cancer Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. However, UVA can also cause burns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9a742f" class="body-graf"&gt;UV radiation in general is a known carcinogen in humans, and the more exposure you get over time, the greater your risk of developing skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-51dd61" class="body-graf"&gt;So choose a sunscreen with the label "broad spectrum" to ensure you're protecting yourself against both UVA and UVB rays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-bb450b" class="body-heading"&gt;How to Get Started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bd8a34" class="body-graf"&gt;Here's what to look for when buying a sunscreen, experts previously told TODAY.com:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-b62a48" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;At least SPF 30&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Broad-spectrum protection&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Easy to apply every day&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not expired&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-46d5e8" class="body-graf"&gt;Then you can choose between chemical and mineral. Chemical ones absorb UV rays whereas physical sunscreens block them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5330db" class="body-graf"&gt;“Don’t let fears about chemicals outweigh the fear or risk of the UV rays, which remains the major risk factor for skin cancer,” board-certified dermatologist Dr. &lt;a href="https://avamd.com/our-dermatology-team/" target="_blank"&gt;Ava Shamban&lt;/a&gt; previously told TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-674685" class="body-graf"&gt;Also keep in mind that spray and stick sunscreens tend to provide patchy coverage and need to be used multiple times in a row and rubbed into the skin to get the necessary protection. But any sunscreen is better than none, so experts say it's fine to use these products when appropriate, especially to help you apply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-53f6d6" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/expert-tip-of-the-day" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TODAY’s Expert Tip of the Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;series is all about simple strategies to make life a little easier.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="article-content-area"&gt;&lt;p id="article-123"&gt;A general medical practitioner, Dr Julian Nii Ardey Ansah, has highlighted the benefits of the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine in the prevention of various types of cancers and genital warts. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
According to Dr Ansah, the HPV vaccine protects against infections caused by the types of HPV responsible for more than 90 percent of cervical cancers, as well as most cases of anal, vulvar, vaginal, penile, oropharyngeal (throat) cancers, as it prevents about 90 percent of genital warts.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Speaking in an interview with GhanaWeb on June 20, 2025, the medical expert described the vaccine as ‘highly effective’ and urged the public to prioritise early vaccination.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“The earlier we vaccinate, the better the chances of preventing these life-threatening diseases. Parents, schools, and health authorities must work together to ensure young people are protected at the right time," he emphasised.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He explained that the vaccine provides nearly 100 percent protection against cervical pre-cancers linked to HPV types 16 and 18 when administered before exposure. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“This is why it’s most effective when given to young people before they become sexually active,” he stated.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Dr Ansah also assured the public that the HPV vaccine is generally safe. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He listed common side effects as; pain, redness, or swelling at the injection area, as well as mild fever, headache, nausea, fatigue, dizziness, or fainting particularly among adolescents, stating that rare side effects may include allergic reactions or syncope (fainting).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
However, he noted that the vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy and advised women to wait until after childbirth before receiving it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
On the recommended age for vaccination, Dr Ansah said the ideal time for boys and girls to receive the vaccine is between the ages of 9 and 14, using a two-dose schedule at 0 and 6–12 months. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The recommended dose for children aged 15 to 26, is a three-dose catch-up schedule which can advisedly be administered at 0, 1–2, and 6 months. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Adults aged 27 to 45 may also be vaccinated following consultation with a healthcare provider, although the benefit is considered less effective due to possible prior exposure to HPV.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Dr Ansah concluded by encouraging parents and guardians to take proactive steps in safeguarding their children’s health by ensuring timely vaccination.&lt;br&gt;

Carbohydrates such as bread, pasta, fruit, and sweets are broken down to glucose in the digestive system, which then enters the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After eating, a hormone called insulin briefly rises in the body to help absorb glucose from the blood, so it can be used as energy. In healthy individuals, the body tightly regulates blood sugar levels, keeping them within a narrow range — about 4.0-4.5mmol/L when fasting, and no more than 7.8mmo/L two hours after a meal, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;British Heart Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, even healthy individuals experience after-meal spikes which sometimes reach levels similar to those seen in diabetics, and often go unnoticed. These sudden surges can trigger energy crashes, sugar cravings and mood swings in the short term.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over a longer period, frequent high blood sugar peaks can contribute to low-grade inflammation, impaired insulin sensitivity and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease — even in people without diagnosed diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The good news is you don't need to banish carbohydrates from your diet to keep blood sugar levels in check. Instead, health coach and parliamentary advisor Steve Bennett suggests a slow and steady approach, pairing carbs with foods that digest more slowly to help smooth out those peaks and troughs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31890044" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;span class="caption" itemprop="description"&gt;You don't need to say no to carbs, you just need to eat them correctly&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Steve says: "Big blood sugar spikes are primarily caused by ultra-processed carbohydrates, especially those stripped of fibre." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He added: "Incorporating fibre (vegetables, salads, and whole grains), protein (lean meats, legumes, or tofu) and healthy fats (avocado, nuts, and olive oil) at every meal slows the absorption of sugars and helps maintain steady blood glucose levels."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theweirdsciencedrop.substack.com/p/the-weird-science-drop-9-sunken-ships" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scientists have pinpointed the exact two years in your life when you age the fastest. Much more on this in our weekly newsletter here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;How to avoid blood sugar spikes&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over time, repeated big blood sugar spikes contribute to insulin resistance (where your body is less able to regulate its blood sugar levels), increasing the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and even accelerated ageing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Heart disease is the third-leading cause of death in England and Wales, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregistrationsummarytables/2023" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;ONS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.diabetes.org.uk/about-us/about-the-charity/our-strategy/statistics#:~:text=Our%20data%20shows%20that%20more,by%20167%2C822%20from%202021%2D22." target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Diabetes UK, which&lt;/a&gt; estimates diabetes levels are at an all-time high.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h5&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Check food packaging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31890081" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;meta itemprop="width" content="615"&gt;
&lt;meta itemprop="height" content="410"&gt;

&lt;figcaption class="publication-theme-indicator"&gt;
&lt;span class="caption" itemprop="description"&gt;A meal packed with protein, healthy fats and fibre is great for your blood sugar levels&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Steve says: “Hidden sugars in 'healthy' foods like granola bars, fruit juices, low-fat yoghurts, and smoothies often contain as much sugar as desserts and are big spikers. Unexpected culprits like rice cakes (higher glycemic index than sugar), dried fruit, sushi with white rice, and even sweet potato fries can trigger large glucose spikes.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He recommends checking labels for key indicators that food will spike your blood sugar:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 5g of sugar per 100g may cause moderate spikes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above 10g per 100g is likely to trigger significant glucose elevation (often marked red on food labels)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aim for products where fibre is at least half the sugar content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h5&gt;2. Eat fibre first&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;Data from the Food &amp;amp; Drink Federation reveals that only 9% of adults meet the recommended 30g of fibre per day. A new survey from &lt;a href="https://www.saga.co.uk/health-insurance" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Saga Health Insurance&lt;/a&gt; suggests this shortfall may be driving blood sugar crashes, cravings, brain fog, and potential long-term health issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eating high-fibre foods before a meal can significantly reduce glucose spikes. Instead of cutting out your favourite carb-heavy snacks, start with a salad, raw vegetables, or a handful of nuts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Combining high-carb foods with protein and healthy fats helps slow digestion and moderate glucose impact. For example, pair dark chocolate with almonds or have berries alongside a dessert.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5&gt;3. Make smart swaps&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;For Brits looking to swap a chocolate bar for a satisfying, balanced snack, Steve recommends Greek yoghurt with berries, chia seed pudding, hummus with vegetables, some nuts or a boiled egg.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Steve suggests replacing white rice with cauliflower rice for meals, using leafy greens instead of tortillas, and swapping tropical fruits for lower-glycemic berries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31890062" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;figcaption class="publication-theme-indicator"&gt;
&lt;span class="caption" itemprop="description"&gt;Energy crashes and sugar cravings are signs of high blood glucose spikes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h5&gt;4. Move after meals&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;You don't need to do intense exercise to be healthy. It turns out you can eat your favourite foods in moderation and resist sugar spikes by taking a 10-minute walk after eating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Steve notes that this can reduce glucose spikes by up to 30%. Gentle movement helps muscles use up excess sugar before it accumulates, he explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5&gt;5. Avoid nighttime snacks&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bodies become more insulin-resistant in the evening, meaning the same food eaten at night causes a higher glucose response than if it were eaten earlier in the day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The health coach explained: "Nighttime spikes disrupt sleep quality, impair overnight cellular repair, and contribute to morning brain fog. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"They also interfere with growth hormone release, which happens primarily during deep sleep and is essential for tissue repair and metabolic health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 11:39:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxPX2tlalZhb2xwWm5lajdMYXNyWDR6TFlucEEwSUxid05NVEFGUFdhS0xKUnpBYmVQbE5zQldHemFYTFdlN1g4bFY2UFl4LUR3cHp0S1ZBbGRYa0RMYzVhTnQ3ZmExVlJiU0lTdjgwRDNJOV9LbVI4TGRTQW1QaXlwNnJYVQ</guid></item><item><title>通过吃一种含有“关键”营养素的水果来帮助降低血压- Surrey Live | Help lower blood pressure by eating one fruit with 'crucial' nutrient - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPbUM1ZS1DZnpoQjVqejlnUXR2RnFMQkNkSXJrNjhwZDBMV09WcGExUlVRYjBLV3g3T2lKOW5MRm15aWlVMHlsNHBXN2NOMm5uT2JWU3VTS0NRMEFUdThGTURGeWZoX1V3cFpPeVkwSFFBMVUzTXg4SGVXNzRUQ09JZ1kyWGZVdm1H?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating a wide variety of fruit and vegetables &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/eat-30-plants-week-improve-30701080" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;is good for our health&lt;/a&gt; and the more different plants you can eat the more nutrients you will be getting into your system and the healthier &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/gut-health-score-93-out-30672961" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;your gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; will be. Some experts suggest &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/eat-30-plants-week-improve-30701080" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;30 plants a week&lt;/a&gt; is a good number to aim for. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most of us will have heard about the importance of vitamins to our bodies since we were children. But there are many other important nutrients that we hear a lot less about, despite their importance to our health. Among them is magnesium, which is involved in more than 300 reactions in the body, registered dietitian Patricia Bannan &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/fruits-with-high-magnesium-rcna202425" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;told Today&lt;/a&gt;. But "despite its importance, about half of US adults don’t get enough magnesium from food", she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are simple ways to increase your magnesium intake — and you can do it simply from eating the foods you come across easily in any supermarket, instead of having to spend a fortune on expensive food or supplements. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is magnesium and why is it important?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Magnesium is a mineral that helps several bodily functions, including:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;turning the food we eat into energy&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; making sure our cells, organs and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9820677/#:~:text=Magnesium%20(Mg)%20is%20involved%20in,of%20the%20blood%E2%80%93brain%20barrier" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;brains are functioning as they should&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;stabilising moods&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;maintaining our muscles&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;aiding vitamin D in travelling around the body&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;making sure the glands which aid bone health work normally.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;As well as the above, scientific research also shows it may play a role in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/9/5/429?ref=circle-magazine-health-wellness-genetics-blog" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;improving symptoms of anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28654669/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;mild depression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35184264/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;help improve sleep&lt;/a&gt;. There's also evidence that healthy magnesium levels help your heart health. And one review of evidence found that people with higher intakes of magnesium had an &lt;a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/glossary#meta-analysis" rel="nofollow"&gt;8% lower chance of developing high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; than those with the lowest intakes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theweirdsciencedrop.substack.com/p/the-weird-science-drop-9-sunken-ships" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scientists have pinpointed the exact two years in your life when you age the fastest.

&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What fruit is high in magnesium?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; You can get magnesium in several different fruits (and other foods) but one of the best is the &lt;b&gt;passion fruit&lt;/b&gt; , which contains 4-5 grams of magnesium per fruit. One &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.00617/full" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;study in the Frontiers in Pharmacology journal&lt;/a&gt; said that "more than 110 phytochemical constituents" have already been found in the plant which shows "a wide range of health effects and biological activities such as antioxidant, anti-hypertensive, anti-tumor, antidiabetic, hypolipidemic activities". &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It adds: "These outstanding results suggest that passion fruit may offer a range of health benefits, such as managing inflammatory and neurological disease, and also preventing some chronic diseases like hypertension and hyperlipidemia."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today.com notes that "the pulp of the aromatic fruit can be eaten raw, as a yogurt topping, or added to juices and drinks" and adds that it "also tops the list of fruits with the most protein".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What other foods are high in magnesium?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are lots of other good sources of magnesium, including:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;leafy green vegetables like spinach or chard, as well as green peas, sweetcorn and potatoes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;nuts and seeds like almonds, cashews, chia seeds, peanuts and pumpkin seeds&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;legumes like black beans and edamame beans&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;fruits like avocado, banana, papaya, blackberries, kiwis and figs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;dark chocolate&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rebecca McManamon, consultant dietitian and British Dietetic Association spokesperson, told the &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/bbc"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; that you are probably reaching the recommended daily amount of magnesium if you’re eating unsalted nuts or wholegrains daily, along with a variety of fruit, green vegetables and legumes. She added: "If these are not foods you eat regularly, you may be at a higher risk of not getting enough magnesium." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What about supplements?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many scientists adopt the "food first" approach to getting the nutrients we need. Professor Tim Spector, of Kings College London, says he generally believes supplements to be ineffective and that, unless people are dealing with specific health issues, most of us should be able to get the nutrients we need from food. And registered dietitian Anna Taylor told the Cleveland Clinic: "Food first is my mantra. If you take a dietary supplement for magnesium and take too much, you may experience uncomfortable side effects such as cramping, diarrhea and nausea."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How do I know if I'm eating enough magnesium?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Taylor told the Cleveland Clinic that eating the following would be a good way of getting the amount of magnesium your body needs:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Five servings of fruits and vegetables per day&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;At least three servings of whole grains per day&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;One ounce of nuts or seeds per day&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;One serving of legumes most days of the week.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;And it's important to note that if you eat those recommended amounts, you'll also be getting several other nutrients and health benefits that those food contains, including fibre. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 11:38:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPbUM1ZS1DZnpoQjVqejlnUXR2RnFMQkNkSXJrNjhwZDBMV09WcGExUlVRYjBLV3g3T2lKOW5MRm15aWlVMHlsNHBXN2NOMm5uT2JWU3VTS0NRMEFUdThGTURGeWZoX1V3cFpPeVkwSFFBMVUzTXg4SGVXNzRUQ09JZ1kyWGZVdm1H</guid></item><item><title>Ozempic时代正在迫使精英阶层改变健康休养地-《华盛顿邮报》 | The Ozempic era is forcing wellness retreats for the elite to change - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOU1psSHVlT3pITnV4QkVzUXg4clhvd2x4VllSRHk5TXh6VDd0RUtUYS1ILWtnY05rSnk3LS1iYlRVMXpZcUtySm91X2pCS1NjbGVsVWNSYVE5ZnhwQVQ5d0dCeHc5V2RrUUt0QS1DQ3dmZU84YVNwNWhXRnViMTJ5aVNWYUtUUFI1?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="53Z432Y3SRG5NAJUCFCJNQWYJM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It was 3 p.m., and already Mitra Mechanic had completed a yoga class and a four-hour guided hike. Peeling off her sweat-soaked clothes and devouring a snack — a few pieces of raw vegetables and a meager dollop of hummus — she steeled herself for the next workout on her packed schedule: strength training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ST2NW4WRUNCY3F6YDJ2HZH46KU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Mechanic, a 55-year-old tech industry worker from Austin, was attending &lt;a href="https://www.mountaintrek.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Mountain Trek&lt;/a&gt;, a wellness retreat in the mountains of British Columbia that promises to overhaul guests’ health in as little as a week. The cost of that week? $6,900 per person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EHLVSGXUFRDTBMWR7WACDUOHKE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;On paper, Mechanic was looking for a “reset” after a stressful period. But like many of her fellow attendees, she was also hoping to slim down on the rigorous program. She was prescribed the highest dose of the GLP-1 prescription weight loss medication Mounjaro for her Type 2 diabetes, but she hadn’t experienced the transformative weight loss many people report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BSFBHEC7JZCVTCZ4KO5IKYHBUA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I’m some sort of a unicorn case,” she sighed. She even hired a personal trainer, but that hadn’t meaningfully moved the scale in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MTFFOQQWEJBNZKVLIHVCAAWFWU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I had done all those other things,” Mechanic said, “so this was something completely new to try.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="22RL63JW5RF4JGNINZSNQJCCJA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When Mountain Trek launched its first wellness program in 2000, it attracted a steady stream of affluent guests looking to overhaul their health and drop pounds fast. Twenty-five years later, medications like Mounjaro and Ozempic can yield dramatic weight loss while requiring less money and effort than a luxury wellness retreat. In response, Mountain Trek and similar retreats are evolving to meet the needs of a new type of guest: medicated, motivated and seeking support. Some wish to supercharge their weight loss progress, while others need help mitigating unwanted side effects such as digestive discomfort and significant muscle loss. Then there are those who hope to taper off the drugs for good without regaining every pound lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RNPSI2MT7RHINEUOBSU7YRZK2Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“There are people that come, and they’ve been on it for three years, and they’re just so tired of feeling nauseous and constipated,” said Mountain Trek co-owner Kirkland Shave. “They have come to Mountain Trek to get off of it. To learn accumulated lifestyle habits, so that they don’t then gain all the weight back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3XGRAZ327BCXDFPWBR7B3KU2U4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In addition to Mountain Trek’s usual program — physical activity, nutritious yet low-calorie food, lectures on topics including sleep and willpower, massages, sauna and cold plunge circuits, and stress-reducing mindfulness techniques — guests on GLP-1s can book additional private sessions with a personal trainer or nutritionist and schedule follow-up coaching sessions after returning home to maintain momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="4FOHZBEJOVCUVJWW6IGGGCSXDM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="4FOHZBEJOVCUVJWW6IGGGCSXDM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;GLP-1s: Friend or foe?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="REO3MB5DPNCGTJMKO5TFZP7WHE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Like Shave, some retreat owners are finding opportunity in the imperfections and challenges associated with GLP-1s rather than seeing them as an existential threat to their business models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J3FWGEEKSZFYNHYWJ7QOY3T6FU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Alex Glasscock, CEO and co-founder of &lt;a href="https://www.theranchlife.com/" target="_blank"&gt;the Ranch&lt;/a&gt; — a luxury health retreat known for its celebrity clientele, strenuous morning hikes and trail snack of precisely six almonds dusted with “Ranch Caviar” (black salt) — says his team has been fielding requests from people who lost a significant amount of weight on GLP-1s and now feel inspired to address other aspects of their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="63TRFB5AGFEOVBC5RKLAUNMYOA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It gives people who have been struggling with excessive obesity the opportunity to get into a weight zone, or a body-type zone, that actually gives them the self-confidence, the self-esteem and the pattern interruption to empower them to eat healthier and exercise more,” Glasscock said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RETJSQ7TDRA5VBAWLI7YWMT3MM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Ranch responded to these requests by launching a private GLP-1 program. Starting at $12,200 for six nights, it enlists a nutritionist, hiking guide and personal trainer to help guests build muscle, improve overall fitness and learn about optimal nutrition. The offering has been “quite popular,” according to Glasscock, and the company expects interest to grow alongside the ubiquity of weight-loss medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KEPPWPQ4KJG2XGCCUP2447AVLY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pritikin.com/wellness-retreat" target="_blank"&gt;Pritikin Longevity Center&lt;/a&gt; in South Florida says about 10 percent of its guests are taking GLP-1s. A two-week stay at the center starts at $14,000 and includes a personalized program devised by physicians, nutritionists, trainers and psychologists. Each retreat typically begins with a medical consultation including blood panels, an exercise tolerance test and a DEXA body scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MI5GD3XH2ZEYPKCIVRMVM65EVY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“There’s a big percentage of the population that either has tried them already or that will use them, and we know this is not going anywhere,” said Pritikin’s medical director Marianela Areces, who says the center can make a partner with the drugs instead of an enemy. “Our program is actually helping guests that are on these medications to be able to tolerate them and stay on them and avoid the side effects, or mitigate some of the negative effects that these medications may have.” A new Pritikin meal plan called the GLP-1 Plate, for example, increases the serving of protein to prevent muscle loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AGKJG4UL4ZHFPFIFK3IDM3ZNTQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Occasionally, Pritikin’s on-site physicians will prescribe GLP-1s as part of a patient’s customized weight loss program. Last year in April, the center hosted a 30-year-old man for a month-long stay. His goal, Areces said, was to start taking Mounjaro under the supervision of the center’s doctors, which he did alongside a high-protein, low-fat diet and weight-resistance exercises. By the fall, adhering to Pritikin’s strategy had produced the desired result. During a subsequent week-long visit, a body composition test indicated he’d lost 80 pounds while preserving muscle mass, Areces said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UQIVZJBKPVCFXL3G3ZA5646XTY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That Pritikin guest declined to be interviewed, but according to Areces, the results of&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;his hard work in the gym and kitchen gave him the confidence to begin slowly reducing the medication under the guidance of Pritikin’s endocrinologist. “He was very motivated, and he wanted to come off. He’s like, ‘I can do this,’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="6XC4IK7UYFG3RFPLKSMJHK5C4Y" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="6XC4IK7UYFG3RFPLKSMJHK5C4Y" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What a magic shot doesn’t provide&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HY4UAW5MT5EYHHVMLV5VVNOCIM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;On the final morning of her Mountain Trek retreat, Mechanic reported to a private office behind the gym for her final weigh-in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3CXATFKG5NAIDNABNVLFIPLY7Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I lost six or seven pounds in the week, which I hadn’t [done] this entire time on Mounjaro,” she said. Back in Austin, Mechanic’s doctor also ran a blood test to see how a week of extreme wellness had affected her blood sugar levels. “He was stunned at how much of a significant drop it had,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="62KTP7BWIRFONKM3E4I5Z73J2Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Weight loss, lower blood sugar and better digestion are virtually guaranteed in a luxury health retreat’s structured, temptation-free world, but integrating the program’s teachings back home is challenging. Mechanic has regained some of the weight she lost at Mountain Trek, but she says other lessons from the experience have stuck, particularly the “de-stressing and relaxation piece.” Her menopausal sleep issues have improved, and she occasionally visits a local cold plunge studio for its reputed metabolism-boosting, inflammation-lowering benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7WJS4WDUMJE45DLL6Z44WR3G4M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Is a Mountain Trek retreat worth its high price tag? Mechanic says it is. She’s completed the program twice and hopes to return for a third time this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WGS5GCXGS5GZ7DCX3GELF5SERA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“That sense of accomplishment at the end of the week is really pretty invaluable,” she said, reflecting on a world where so much — including weight loss — is increasingly effortless. “When you finish the week of Mountain Trek, you look back at the lows, like when you’re on a mountain you’re ready to jump off because you’re so winded, and then the highs of sitting in the hot tub at the end of the day, chatting with the group, looking at the beautiful scenery. For me, it was like, &lt;i&gt;my body was able to do that. &lt;/i&gt;It’s much more than weight loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LQ3LX4OUQBAMPE4RYDF34KYEEE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Esme Benjamin is a freelance travel and wellness writer based in New York City.

The drug, an antiretroviral, works not by stimulating an immune response, but by blocking HIV from reproducing during its early stages—specifically, by disrupting the function of the virus’s capsid protein. This happens so long as the body receives injections every six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Lenacapavir has already been approved in some countries as a treatment for HIV in people with forms of the virus that are resistant to other treatments. However, prior to this week, its prophylactic use had not been approved anywhere, making the FDA’s decision a significant new development in the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The drug is not the first medicine that can be taken preemptively to protect against an HIV infection: pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pills were already available in many countries, including the United States. But these must be taken every day, and ensuring ongoing access to these medicines, and that people actually remember to take them, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/lenacapavir-usaid-hiv-aids-funding-cuts/"&gt;is a known challenge&lt;/a&gt;. It’s hoped the long-lasting effects of lenacapavir will make it easier for people to stay protected against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;According to its creator, Gilead Sciences, lenacapavir will be marketed under the trade name Yeztugo. The company has committed to manufacturing 10 million doses by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“This is a historic day in the decades-long fight against HIV. Yeztugo is one of the most important scientific breakthroughs of our time and offers a very real opportunity to help end the HIV epidemic,” Daniel O’Day, president and CEO of Gilead, said in a &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.gilead.com/news/news-details/2025/yeztugo-lenacapavir-is-now-the-first-and-only-fda-approved-hiv-prevention-option-offering-6-months-of-protection" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.gilead.com/news/news-details/2025/yeztugo-lenacapavir-is-now-the-first-and-only-fda-approved-hiv-prevention-option-offering-6-months-of-protection"}' href="https://www.gilead.com/news/news-details/2025/yeztugo-lenacapavir-is-now-the-first-and-only-fda-approved-hiv-prevention-option-offering-6-months-of-protection" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;However, lenacapavir’s price may be a barrier to access.

This kind of testing – monitoring the health of people who regularly work with H5N1-infected animals – is how the vast majority of cases (64 out of 70) have been found in this outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But then, several CDC officials overseeing the bird flu response were &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/trump-health-layoffs-include-staff-overseeing-bird-flu-response-source-says-2025-04-01/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; on 1 April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Since then, only about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;50 people&lt;/a&gt; in the US have been tested after exposure to sick animals – and no positive cases have been announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s also been difficult to understand the extent of the outbreak and how the virus spreads among animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We still just don’t have a good picture of the scope and scale of this outbreak – we never really have.

This funding was used to monitor, test, vaccinate and otherwise respond to public health issues at the state, local, territorial and tribal level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We’re seeing health departments scrambling,” Nuzzo said. “That infrastructure is just dramatically eroding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;International monitoring programs to address outbreaks before they expand across borders have also been cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We have taken for granted all of those protections, and I fear that we are poised to see the consequences,” Nuzzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Trump’s crackdown on immigration also poses a major challenge in detecting cases and treating patients during outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“A lot of the people who are most at risk are strongly disincentivized to report any cases, given that many of them are undocumented or are not US citizens,” Rasmussen said. “Nobody wants to go get tested if they’re going to end up in an Ice detention facility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When cases are not detected, that means patients are not able to access care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although it’s rare for people to become sick with H5N1, for instance – the virus is still primarily an avian, not a human, influenza – this variant of bird flu has a 52% mortality rate globally among people with known infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Allowing a deadly virus to spread and mutate under the radar has troubling implications for its ability to change into a human influenza without anyone knowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;And if such changes were detected, widening gaps in communication could be the next hurdle for preventing a pandemic, Nuzzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Communication is our most important public health intervention. People, in order to be able to know how to protect themselves, need to have access to facts, and they need to believe in the messengers. And the communication around the measles outbreaks are deeply eroding our standing with the American people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Even stockpiled vaccines and other protective measures, like personal protective equipment, take time to distribute, Nuzzo added. “And flu is a fast-moving disease that could cause a lot of damage in the months it would take to mount a vaccination campaign.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The US government’s cancellation of its $766m contract with Moderna to research and develop an H5N1 vaccine also signals a concerning strategy from health officials, Nuzzo and Rasmussen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Other restrictions on vaccine development, like a new plan to test all vaccines against saline placebos, is “going to make it extremely difficult to approve any new vaccine” and would “have a devastating impact on our ability to respond to a potential pandemic”, Rasmussen said – especially in a rapidly moving pandemic where speed matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“You don’t have time for that if this virus causes a human-to–human outbreak,” Rasmussen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;All of these policies mean the US is less prepared for a pandemic than it was in 2020, she said. And it also means there will be preventable suffering now, even before the next big one strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We are actively making people less safe, less healthy and more dead,” Rasmussen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPNF9rb2RSUDhTOEZ6ZmttenFjaHA0RWNJQ0hYbFNTRDVUaG94b3huM0Y1elRPU1U2ajNjUlNhQWhqOUY4ZTdpRjhxNTIyQ1JzV1RBWmZMMVBFLVBYb0xaS3VqN1ZVUXlOcGgzSDZvdWl5OVQwdlItRDdDNE0waFV2YlNnc1Z0YjVJMWRoUGVRSFg4dDVKS19heVpRV3VLQkgt</guid></item><item><title>Wegovy效应：一种新药重塑了肥胖青少年的生活-路透社 | The Wegovy effect: A new drug reshapes the lives of teens with obesity - Reuters</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE1RZmV5TnpwZkZjLXhCRGRIUW4tWTlaYmpPRVdsNUVZQzZLbVgtNHNzcFZCOERNR1NoRzBYSXM2X2dpYWI4N21FQ0szRHFac3JlR2pzYjlGMkFBQzNwY291cUdsSEF0LWJZX3VZcUt6VXk1Zk1rSnEtcjB4d2FLdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE1RZmV5TnpwZkZjLXhCRGRIUW4tWTlaYmpPRVdsNUVZQzZLbVgtNHNzcFZCOERNR1NoRzBYSXM2X2dpYWI4N21FQ0szRHFac3JlR2pzYjlGMkFBQzNwY291cUdsSEF0LWJZX3VZcUt6VXk1Zk1rSnEtcjB4d2FLdw</guid></item><item><title>感染多达30%美国人的常见脑寄生虫干扰神经元通信- IFLScience | Common Brain Parasite Infecting Up To 30 Percent Of Americans Disrupts Neuron Communication - IFLScience</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwgFBVV95cUxOeHFNQ2QxOXBqaXJnZ2NLbmFuQWpZZlo5Z3VaeVV1d2NPcWxBLUdzS3IxOTFZT0tadm8wek5POG1LLVh3R1ZXbE1QX3dJNjlEM05OUlcxM2w0YVByd0xrWlUwcXJLMEJGelUzYzZsUHdZUl9OdEEycDZoSkNkdW5GTHpwVEJDOXU4a1hselk4NDhrTEpwX3hyVk5SbkNnQzBlLVptclY5MTlLQXc5V2g3Sm5IMzB6eVpPd3JjSlc0TzRSQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii &lt;/em&gt;is an opportunistic bugger, capable of infecting pretty much any warm-blooded animal and has a particular preference for living in brain cells. Once someone or something is infected, the parasites form cysts in neurons that can last for life. Many people who are infected by the parasites (around 10 to 30 percent of the US) often don’t even know it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parasite is often contracted from undercooked meat or exposure to cat feces. In many cases, infected people are asymptomatic, but some people do develop flu-like symptoms like fever, muscle aches, headaches, and fatigue. They may also have swollen lymph nodes, particularly in the neck. None of these symptoms are peculiar to the parasite and are common to other infections. Individuals with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/toxoplasmosis/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;weakened immune systems&lt;/a&gt;, however, can experience more severe symptoms, including confusion, blurred vision, slurred speech, and are unsteady on their feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has even been claimed that getting the parasite can do wonders for your dating life, at least according to one study from &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/people-infected-by-brainaltering-cat-parasite-are-more-attractive-finds-study-63735" target="_blank"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most cases, a person’s immune system will keep the parasite in check, but it can stay dormant in their brains for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present, diagnostic tools can only detect whether a person has been exposed to &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt; by identifying antibodies. This, unfortunately, does not tell doctors whether the parasite is still present in the brain or how and to what extent it has impacted their brain function. But that may soon change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their new study, researchers at the University of California, Riverside, found that infected neurons release fewer extracellular vesicles (EVs), tiny packets surrounded by a membrane that are used by cells to exchange information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found this disruption in EV signaling can interfere with how neurons and glial cells, especially astrocytes, maintain a healthy brain environment,” Emma H. Wilson, a professor of biomedical sciences in the Riverside School of Medicine, who led the research, explained in a &lt;a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2025/06/18/how-common-brain-parasite-disrupts-neural-communication" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even a handful of infected neurons can shift the brain’s neurochemical balance. This suggests that communication between neurons and supporting glial cells is not only critical, but also vulnerable to hijacking by parasites.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings could represent a new way to use EVs as biomarkers that can be isolated in a person’s blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The existing research has focused on mouse models and human cells in a laboratory setting. In essence, in healthy mouse brains, astrocytes – a type of glial cell that makes up the majority of cells in the central nervous system – regulate neurotransmitters like glutamate. This ensures that neurons do not become overexcited (where a neuron fires signals too rapidly, not that it is looking forward to something). But when infected with &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;, the neurons stop sending the right EV signals, resulting in regulation stopping and higher levels of glutamate, which can lead to seizures, neural damage, or altered brain connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The parasite may play a larger role in neurological and behavioral conditions than we previously thought,” Wilson added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson and colleagues are now looking to analyze human blood samples for EVs linked to the parasite infection. They also hope to better understand how glial cells detect and respond to the parasite proteins, potentially offering new therapies or even vaccines in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our brains have built-in defenses that may recognize and respond to neurons infected by &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;,” Wilson explained. “If we can learn how to support or enhance that process, we may be able to better protect people, especially the most vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its impacts, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt; is often misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no need to avoid someone who is infected; most people live their entire lives without symptoms,” Wilson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pregnant individuals should be cautious as the parasite can cause serious birth defects if contracted for the first time during pregnancy. The most effective prevention is proper food handling and hygiene. Cook meat thoroughly, wash vegetables, and always wash your hands after handling cat litter, especially from young cats, which are more likely to shed the parasite.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper is published in &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1012733" target="_blank"&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 10:50:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxOeHFNQ2QxOXBqaXJnZ2NLbmFuQWpZZlo5Z3VaeVV1d2NPcWxBLUdzS3IxOTFZT0tadm8wek5POG1LLVh3R1ZXbE1QX3dJNjlEM05OUlcxM2w0YVByd0xrWlUwcXJLMEJGelUzYzZsUHdZUl9OdEEycDZoSkNkdW5GTHpwVEJDOXU4a1hselk4NDhrTEpwX3hyVk5SbkNnQzBlLVptclY5MTlLQXc5V2g3Sm5IMzB6eVpPd3JjSlc0TzRSQQ</guid></item><item><title>40岁的男子死于癌症后，医生告诉他胃痛是由于压力|热门-印度斯坦时报-印度斯坦时报 | 40-year-old man dies of cancer after doctors told him stomach ache was due to stress | Trending - Hindustan Times - Hindustan Times</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/trending/40yearold-man-dies-of-cancer-after-doctors-told-him-stomach-ache-was-due-to-stress-101750415730568.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A 40-year-old father of four in the UK died from bowel cancer just eight months after he began experiencing stomach pain, which he initially believed was due to stress, a &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/dad-40-dies-cancer-after-35417374" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="report"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by Mirror UK said.

With four children aged 12, nine, three and one, Kyle agreed to six rounds of chemotherapy and further treatments to give himself a chance to defeat the disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, it continued to spread and led to his death months later. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(Also read: &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/trending/man-goes-to-doctor-for-toothache-leaves-with-a-shocking-prostate-cancer-diagnosis-101736832713384.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Man goes to doctor for toothache, leaves with a shocking prostate cancer diagnosis"&gt;Man goes to doctor for toothache, leaves with a shocking prostate cancer diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Don't ignore these symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before passing, he urged others to be proactive about health issues and not dismiss conventional symptoms if they continue to affect one's health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The common symptoms of bowel cancer can include changes in your bowel movement, stomachache, feeling lumps in your abdomen, unusual bloating, unexplained weight loss and shortness of breath.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to experts, one should seek medical help if any of these symptoms continue for three weeks or more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(Also read: &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/trending/womans-itchy-legs-turn-out-to-be-rare-cancer-doctors-dismissed-symptoms-for-months-101746094193089.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Woman’s itchy legs turn out to be rare cancer, doctors dismissed symptoms for months"&gt;Woman’s itchy legs turn out to be rare cancer, doctors dismissed symptoms for months&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hindustan Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 10:48:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>常见的兴奋剂可能是预防婴儿猝死综合症的关键- SciTechDaily | A Common Stimulant Could Hold the Key to Preventing Sudden Infant Death Syndrome - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPWnBXXzZTUmVIZEtORG9MVC1mQXNYVk1aU2dzNUM0c19oeDI4ZXNGc0JzOXhOSjRCY3FYUktEdzdpODQwQ0pLTmxHaXBja0VOSGlZLUNPeFZ2eGlqQ1p5THVfSXZEMVRHaWVQNnRsVll2NE5Qd3BRRUM0VUVHXzZHS0w0U3RIOGxuZHJmbDRfNmNBajFMdHMwUDcyendyWmRCQjIydm40WnY5UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 09:40:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPWnBXXzZTUmVIZEtORG9MVC1mQXNYVk1aU2dzNUM0c19oeDI4ZXNGc0JzOXhOSjRCY3FYUktEdzdpODQwQ0pLTmxHaXBja0VOSGlZLUNPeFZ2eGlqQ1p5THVfSXZEMVRHaWVQNnRsVll2NE5Qd3BRRUM0VUVHXzZHS0w0U3RIOGxuZHJmbDRfNmNBajFMdHMwUDcyendyWmRCQjIydm40WnY5UQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
