			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A new study has found a link between 'bad' cholesterol and the risk of dementia. It suggests that common cholesterol-lowering medicines, like statins, can help protect brain health as we age, even in those with low cholesterol already.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The new findings from researchers in Korea contribute to a controversial line of research, mostly based on observational studies. In the past, scientific investigations of dementia risk and levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) have produced inconsistent results, and there is a need for rigorous, randomized controlled trials to clear up the confusion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The current study is also observational, but its "robust" and "diverse" data support the 2024 Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, which &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(24)01296-0"&gt;highlighted&lt;/a&gt; cholesterol as a possible risk factor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Led by neurophysiologist Minwoo Lee from Hallym University College of Medicine in Korea, the new study &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2024-334708"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; that LDL-C levels are "directly associated with reduced dementia incidence, supporting cholesterol management as fundamental in preventing dementia."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_157209" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-157209" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/USC_cholesterolinfographic-scaled-1-642x1076.jpg" alt="Cholesterol Good and Bad" class="size-medium wp-image-157209" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/USC_cholesterolinfographic-scaled-1-642x1076.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/USC_cholesterolinfographic-scaled-1-248x415.jpg 248w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/USC_cholesterolinfographic-scaled-1-768x1287.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/USC_cholesterolinfographic-scaled-1-917x1536.jpg 917w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/USC_cholesterolinfographic-scaled-1-600x1005.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/USC_cholesterolinfographic-scaled-1.jpg 996w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-157209" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Facts on 'good' and 'bad' cholesterol. (&lt;a href="https://www.keckmedicine.org/blog/what-is-the-difference-between-good-and-bad-cholesterol/"&gt;University of Southern California&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The research retrospectively analyzed health data from 11 university hospitals in Korea, encompassing more than half a million individuals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those with LDL-C levels below 70 mg/dL showed a 26 percent decreased risk of all-cause dementia and a 28 percent decreased risk of Alzheimer's disease, compared to those with LDL-C levels above 130mg/dL.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This was true regardless of whether participants were taking statins or not. But when researchers looked at those taking cholesterol-lowering meds specifically, they found an intriguing correlation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Statin use was associated with a 13 percent reduction in all-cause dementia and a 12 percent reduction in Alzheimer's risk compared to those who did not use the medicine. And this was true both for people who had high LDL-C levels and those who had low levels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This indicates "a complex relationship between lipid levels and statin therapy in cognitive health," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2024-334708"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the team of researchers, who hail from various clinics, hospitals, and universities in Korea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the study suggests cholesterol levels below 70 mg/dL may be protective to brain health, the use of statins may also improve dementia outcomes, even if a lower threshold of 'bad' cholesterol is not reached, or even if a person has low cholesterol already.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The results agree with some previous &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/eurjpc/zwab208"&gt;&lt;span&gt;analyses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; but stand in contrast to other observational studies, like one &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000207876"&gt;&lt;span&gt;published in 2023&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which found that both low and high levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were associated with elevated dementia risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In fact, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/63/supplement_2/2922"&gt;&lt;span&gt;some observational studies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; have even found that cholesterol-lowering statins may &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/62/supplement_1/102"&gt;&lt;span&gt;increase the risk of dementia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in those who already show cognitive decline.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The take-home message here is not clear-cut, and while the current research from Korea adds much-needed data to the conversation, the authors say we need specific, randomized controlled trials to dig further. Scientists also need to figure out how LDL cholesterol might be driving dementia in the brain at a molecular level.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important gene that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-figure-out-how-an-alzheimer-s-disease-risk-gene-actually-does-its-damage"&gt;drives the risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, also carries cholesterol to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Neurophysiologist Francesco Tamagnini is studying the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-cholesterol-could-speed-up-alzheimers"&gt;&lt;span&gt;idea that damage to the blood-brain barrier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; can lead to an accumulation of LDL cholesterol in the brain, possibly causing amyloid beta proteins to cluster into plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease. Tamagnini was not involved in the current research, but he &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-observational-study-of-ldl-cholesterol-statins-and-dementia/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; "there is clearly more to the story of Alzheimer's than we first thought."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The results give a convincing argument for researchers to consider LDL cholesterol in addition to the classic approaches," he &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-observational-study-of-ldl-cholesterol-statins-and-dementia/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;writes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in an independent review.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Julia Dudley is head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; she &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-observational-study-of-ldl-cholesterol-statins-and-dementia/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;notes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in another independent review that&lt;span&gt; "dementia risk is complex and influenced by many factors. Without a detailed picture of what's going on in the brain we do not know if there is a direct link between lower cholesterol and reduced dementia risk."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"In the meantime," she &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-observational-study-of-ldl-cholesterol-statins-and-dementia/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;adds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, "keeping our hearts healthy remains one of the most effective ways we can protect our brain health. If you have any concerns about your cholesterol levels, you should speak to your GP."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2024-334708"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp;amp; Psychiatry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Many of us turn to Sudoku, Wordle or brain-training apps to sharpen our minds. But research is increasingly showing one of the best ways to boost memory, focus and brain health is exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/03/06/bjsports-2024-108589"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; reviewed data from more than 250,000 participants across 2,700 studies. We found exercise helps boost brain function – whether it's walking, cycling, yoga, dancing, or even playing active video games such as Pokémon GO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving your body improves how we think, make decisions, remember things and stay focused – no matter your age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What the science says&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our review adds to a growing body of research that shows regular physical activity &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/03/06/bjsports-2024-108589"&gt;improves&lt;/a&gt; three key areas of brain function:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cognition, which is your overall ability to think clearly, learn and make decisions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;memory, especially short-term memory and the ability to remember personal experiences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;executive function, which includes focus, planning, problem-solving and managing emotions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted an umbrella review, which means we looked at the results of more than 130 high-quality research reviews that had already combined findings from many exercise studies. These studies usually involved people starting a new, structured exercise program, not just tracking the exercise they were already doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess the effects on cognition, memory and executive function, the original studies used a range of brain function tests. These included things like remembering word lists, solving puzzles, or quickly switching between tasks – simple activities designed to reliably measure how well the brain is working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The improvements were small to moderate. On average, exercise led to a noticeable boost in cognition, with slightly smaller but still meaningful gains in memory and executive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits showed up across all age groups, though children and teens saw major gains in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="157627" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;) showed greater improvements in executive function after physical activity than other population groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain started responding fairly quickly – many people experienced improvements after just 12 weeks of starting regular exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the greatest benefits were seen in those doing at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days of the week, aiming for a total of about 150 minutes per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's happening in the brain?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activities such as walking or cycling can &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1015950108"&gt;increase the size of the hippocampus&lt;/a&gt;, the part of the brain responsible for memory and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1015950108"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;, older adults who did aerobic exercise for a year grew their hippocampus by 2%, effectively reversing one to two years of age-related brain shrinkage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More intense workouts, such as running or high-intensity interval training, can further &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1155/2017/8305287"&gt;boost neuroplasticity&lt;/a&gt; – the brain's ability to adapt and rewire itself. This helps you learn more quickly, think more clearly and stay mentally sharp with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Another reason to get moving&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's population is ageing. By 2030, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ageing-and-health"&gt;one in six of people will be aged over 60&lt;/a&gt;. With that comes a rising risk of dementia,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="157627" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, many adults aren't moving enough. One in three adults &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity"&gt;aren't meeting the recommended levels&lt;/a&gt; of physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adults &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/behealthy/physical-activity"&gt;should aim for&lt;/a&gt; at least 150 of moderate exercise – such as brisk walking – each week, or at least 75 minutes of more vigorous activity, like running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also important to incorporate muscle-strengthening exercises, such as lifting weights, into workouts at least twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Everyday movement counts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don't need to run marathons or lift heavy weights to benefit. Our study showed lower-intensity activities such as yoga, tai chi and "exergames" (active video games) can be just as effective – sometimes even more so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These activities engage both the brain and body. Tai chi, for instance, requires focus, coordination and memorising sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exergames often include real-time decision-making and rapid response to cues. This trains attention and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these forms of movement are inclusive. They can be done at home, outdoors, or with friends, making them a great option for people of all fitness levels or those with limited mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although you may already be doing a lot through daily life – like walking instead of driving or carrying shopping bags home – it's still important to find time for structured exercise, such as lifting weights at the gym or doing a regular yoga class, to get the full benefits for your brain and body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Real-life applications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're a grandparent, consider playing Wii Sports virtual tennis or bowling with your grandchild. If you're a teenager with signs of ADHD, try a dance class, and see if it impacts your concentration in class. If you're a busy parent, you might be more clear-headed if you can squeeze a 20-minute yoga video session between meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of these cases, you're not just being active, you're giving your brain a valuable tune-up. And unlike most brain-training apps or supplements, exercise delivers far reaching benefits, including improved &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389945721002914?casa_token=pXaOJcQJ7d0AAAAA:0i4BjaxqJ21AQ2bGXI4DfQ6twKNybrg7c2f0_Xs7t-hWyDOH0SuKGTfruy-JlC_rMokUM3iWdlSQ"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/57/18/1203"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workplaces and schools are starting to take note. &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smi.2654"&gt;Short movement breaks&lt;/a&gt; are being introduced during the workday to improve employee focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools that incorporate &lt;a href="https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12966-017-0569-9"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; into the classroom are seeing improvements in students' attention and academic performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is one of the most powerful and accessible tools we have for supporting brain health. Best of all, it's free, widely available and it's never too late to start.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/253751/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gov. Josh Green made the announcement during a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&amp;amp;v=1176998410252423" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;news conference&lt;/a&gt; this morning, in which he urged everyone to get vaccinated for measles, mumps and rubella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case was confirmed Monday night, Green said, in a child that recently returned from international travel. The child developed a fever, runny nose and cough shortly after returning to Hawaii, and sought medical care at Queen’s Island Urgent Care Kapahulu after breaking out in a rash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH said the child is now recovering at home on Oahu, and a household member with similar symptoms is being evaluated for possible measles infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want anyone to panic,” said Green. “There is no reason to panic, and our Department of Health is on it. We’ve been talking through the morning and night about what we do. This is where good public health comes in. But we do have a kid with the measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH is investigating the case and working to identify and directly inform those who may have been exposed to the child. Flight notifications have been issued, and an alert has been sent to health care providers statewide.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The kid’s doing well, by all accounts,” said Green, “so we send our love and prayers to them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/disease_listing/measles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Measles&lt;/a&gt; is a highly contagious disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to CDC, 9 out of 10 people of all ages exposed to an infected person will become infected if they do not have immunity. Exposure includes entering a room up to two hours after an infected person has been there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let me really clear — you’re sitting near somebody with the measles and you’re not vaccinated, you’ve got a really good chance to catch it,” said Green. “I mean, this stuff is infectious, so it’s very important that you listen carefully to our Department of Health officials to find out if you happened to be in that lounge with them, or on the plane with them, or at a play date.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles can also result in complications including pneumonia and encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain. The best way to prevent measles, said DOH, is through vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green said he has issued an emergency rules allowing a child with a religious exemption to receive an MMR vaccine while still retaining their religious exemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawaii’s last detection of measles two years ago was also travel-related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2023, DOH reported &lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/news/newsroom/department-of-health-announces-measles-infection-identified-in-oahu-international-traveler/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one case&lt;/a&gt; of measles in an unvaccinated Oahu resident returning from international travel. Several weeks later, DOH reported a second case in an Oahu resident who was exposed to the first case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the U.S. continent, meanwhile, the number of confirmed measles cases has now grown to 607 in 22 states, mostly in Texas, but also in New Mexico, Oklahoma and California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two school-aged children have died in Texas from the recent outbreak of measles, with the most &lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/04/08/breaking-news/what-to-know-about-u-s-measles-cases-on-the-rise/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;recent death&lt;/a&gt; being an 8-year-old girl who was unvaccinated and previously in good health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH, meanwhile, informs the public of possible exposure at the following places and times:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;March &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30&lt;/strong&gt;, 10:50 a.m. to 2 p.m. at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu at C gates, customs and baggage claim area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;April &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;, 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. at Manoa Valley District Park art class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;April &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;, 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. at Queen’s Island Urgent Care on Kapahulu Avenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;April &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;, 1 p.m. to 7 p.m., Terminal 2 departure areas, TSA checkpoints and the gate area for Delta flight 309 to Atlanta, Ga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH urges anyone who may have been potentially exposed at these places and times — and who are not up-to-date on their MMR vaccines or unsure of their status — to contact their health care provider immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who were potentially exposed should watch for symptoms for three weeks, and if any measles symptoms appear, should immediately isolate at home and contact their health care provider right away.&lt;/p&gt;

Please call your primary care provider for an appointment or go to your nearest network pharmacy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fully vaccinated: Those vaccinated with two doses of MMR vaccine do not need an additional vaccine; however, they should monitor themselves for symptoms for 21 days. If exposed on April 4, the end date for monitoring is April 25, 2025.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the WBAMC said that whether you are vaccinated or not, people who may have been exposed to measles should keep an eye out for symptoms at least until April 25. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with this case, El Paso has confirmed an additional case involving an unvaccinated 3-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms you should watch out for:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever of 101 degrees or greater &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sneezing &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Congestion &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red eyes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rash that starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you or someone you know is experiencing any of these symptoms, call your doctor and ask for a virtual visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case that you feel your symptoms are life-threatening, you should go to the emergency room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to WBAMC, TRICARE beneficiaries can obtain the MMR vaccine from their primary care provider or the nearest TRICARE network pharmacy.  Patients should call before scheduling an appointment to check age eligibility and availability of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), people may recover, but measles can cause serious long-term complications, especially in young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;That is why prevention is so important,” said Maj. Lacy Male, Army Public Health nurse. “The measles vaccine is highly effective, and two doses provide 97 percent protection against the disease, making it one of the best tools for prevention. There is no treatment for measles, only supportive therapy. We want to vaccinate to prevent infection altogether.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/sign-up" target="_blank" title="/sign-up" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt; to receive the top interesting stories from in and around our community once daily in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KFOX</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 23:32:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwJBVV95cUxPNHNyWmNfRWp5bFFnUndZZDJielBWZ1NpZ3hDdjM0UmVnbUV0MWFKaDFKTGxYVXpWUVJnQ2R4X2kxeGk0U0N5RnNMYUQwX09FYmlUTlA3dHpPZTZPMXdtWnZmLUNDUFVyaVNzZnBib1FFMk9IUkc4ajZzeXNWYW5tYm9hUy1OYnFmUkxFWGJ3NFNDUTRvVnByeDVvUDFZSTRqSS1TUWs2UlplV3Y2bE82VnM4eTRlVlpkUENOcGVXdE5JUHV6OVZfamV3WXVrSTFldnBudEFCR0tDMVMxY21kUUZXTzNsaXFfTmFMczBhRDZTNWtwQzMwc0NLUkkzZmx3OEF4UmxfMVVKUzdyNklF</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr. is giving medical advice again and it sounds like the brainworm is back in control - Boing Boing</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxPeEMxR3RRMG1yaWhmRVdERzNYMmV2QlE0VkI2bkhYUTNoVG9EamhOSTFLcF9zSWh1Y3VNclU3NkJWbXhlLVZqSG4wYVFMYW8xdFM1bjFXZUdpbzVWVVdKUlRTSVpFbnQ2RGl1OUFVeW14X3FhcWo0WUJvUjRraTBPVjVCdmFONTVyaWc3aGI4MXVHb011?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Boing Boing</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 23:27:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxPeEMxR3RRMG1yaWhmRVdERzNYMmV2QlE0VkI2bkhYUTNoVG9EamhOSTFLcF9zSWh1Y3VNclU3NkJWbXhlLVZqSG4wYVFMYW8xdFM1bjFXZUdpbzVWVVdKUlRTSVpFbnQ2RGl1OUFVeW14X3FhcWo0WUJvUjRraTBPVjVCdmFONTVyaWc3aGI4MXVHb011</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr. is giving medical advice again and it sounds like the brainworm is back in control - Boing Boing</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxPeEMxR3RRMG1yaWhmRVdERzNYMmV2QlE0VkI2bkhYUTNoVG9EamhOSTFLcF9zSWh1Y3VNclU3NkJWbXhlLVZqSG4wYVFMYW8xdFM1bjFXZUdpbzVWVVdKUlRTSVpFbnQ2RGl1OUFVeW14X3FhcWo0WUJvUjRraTBPVjVCdmFONTVyaWc3aGI4MXVHb0110gGaAUFVX3lxTFBrTEFZYXNJOHo2MmF0TVMtSjBrSXFSSnU0dWtaRzVXdEV0T0FBSXBtM09YcEZFM3pHSGltWXVFMTB5VXhPbV9DOEVNVHNyem1sSE13NU9tcHlWNUVXU2FCSFZ5Y0gzS1JJbkktQWllQkxOTkxuYkxyWHF6eEoya2F2aGRITEl1OXFLVnVqNVJ4UXJBQlR6TWZxT2c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Boing Boing</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 23:27:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxPeEMxR3RRMG1yaWhmRVdERzNYMmV2QlE0VkI2bkhYUTNoVG9EamhOSTFLcF9zSWh1Y3VNclU3NkJWbXhlLVZqSG4wYVFMYW8xdFM1bjFXZUdpbzVWVVdKUlRTSVpFbnQ2RGl1OUFVeW14X3FhcWo0WUJvUjRraTBPVjVCdmFONTVyaWc3aGI4MXVHb0110gGaAUFVX3lxTFBrTEFZYXNJOHo2MmF0TVMtSjBrSXFSSnU0dWtaRzVXdEV0T0FBSXBtM09YcEZFM3pHSGltWXVFMTB5VXhPbV9DOEVNVHNyem1sSE13NU9tcHlWNUVXU2FCSFZ5Y0gzS1JJbkktQWllQkxOTkxuYkxyWHF6eEoya2F2aGRITEl1OXFLVnVqNVJ4UXJBQlR6TWZxT2c</guid></item><item><title>Alzheimer's risk rises when amount of deep sleep falls, study suggests - KSL News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNbzJvOFl4U0UxSVZKQ1c4dEdGSDVoTWJvWjJtSE5SQzByZENzRHVIQWpTRXd4UXRxbV9RbTl1dDZ4RHRPN2g4UFZYTU5HN1NzbEQ1ODhBVXh6c29rUTBBRlN6VjJkLWVMX0NRWDM4UjI2LUZ2YkFNSmxjUkxhbjRtTDdCenZlaHRBOEJVMmx5cGd1dktla2dzRVBGX25tX1gzYVZqNHVwT1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON — Need another reason to prioritize your sleep? Not spending enough time in the two deep stages of sleep — slow-wave and rapid eye movement sleep — may hasten the deterioration of parts of the brain associated with Alzheimer's disease, a new study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deficits in slow-wave and rapid eye movement sleep appear to shrink parts of the brain known to be early indicators of cognitive deterioration and Alzheimer's disease, said lead study author Gawon Cho, a postdoctoral associate in internal medicine at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found the volume of a part of the brain called the inferior parietal region shrunk in people with inadequate slow and REM sleep," Cho said. "That part of the brain synthesizes sensory information, including visuospatial information, so it makes sense that it shows neurodegeneration early in the disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preventive neurologist Dr. Richard Issacson, who established one of the first Alzheimer's prevention clinics in the United States, said in an email that his clinical experience treating adults at risk for Alzheimer's supports the study's findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We also found sleep metrics on deeper sleep predicted cognitive function, so between that plus brain volumes, it's real," said Issacson, who is director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida. He was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happens in the brain during deep sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During deep sleep, the brain sweeps out toxins and dead cells while also repairing and restoring the body for the next day. While we dream during rapid eye movement sleep, the brain is busy processing emotions, consolidating memories and absorbing new information. It makes sense that getting quality deep and rapid eye movement sleep is key to our ability to function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults need about seven to eight hours of sleep to be healthy, while teens and younger children need much more. However, data shows that more than 1 in 3 American adults don't get enough sleep, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say most adults should spend between 20% and 25% of their night in deep sleep, and the same goes for rapid eye movement sleep. Older adults require less, while babies need much more — in fact, infants can spend about 50% of their sleep in REM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, deeper stages of sleep decrease as you age, Cho said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can you get more deep sleep?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep sleep tends to come soon after we fall asleep, while REM sleep appears later in the night, toward morning. Therefore, if you go to bed late and get up early, you are cutting your chances of spending enough time in one or both stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The more time you are in bed, the more a person sleeps, and generally speaking, the longer a person sleeps, the more REM and deep sleep they will get," Isaacson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, you have to do more than just lie in bed longer — you also need have to have an uninterrupted, restful sleep on a regular basis, experts say. If you do that, there's an additional payoff — a February 2023 study found good sleep habits added nearly five years to a man's life expectancy and almost 2.5 years to a woman's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To accomplish this, however, you can't wake up during the night or have trouble falling asleep more than two times a week, the study found. You also have to feel well rested at least five days a week when you wake up. And finally, you can't be using sleep medications to achieve your good slumber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don't lose hope. The good news is that you can easily train your brain to better sleep by following what is called "sleep hygiene." It's important to go to bed at the same time on most nights and get up at the same time most mornings — even on weekends and holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure your sleeping environment is optimal — cooler and darker is better — and block noise or try a sound machine. Avoid booze before bed — it may seem like you're falling asleep more easily, but when your liver finishes metabolizing the alcohol at 3 a.m., your body will wake up, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set up a sleep routine, with no blue lights or distractions at least an hour before bedtime. Try meditation, yoga, tai chi, warm baths — anything that relaxes you is great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How do you make your sleep better? I think people really have to do their part to improve their own sleep," Cho said. "There's no one medicine that improves overall sleep."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;MEASLES CASE CONFIRMED IN CHILD ON OʻAHU — DOH NOTIFIES PUBLIC OF MEASLES EXPOSURE LOCATIONS&lt;/h2&gt;
					&lt;span&gt;Posted on Apr 8, 2025 in  &lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/news/category/newsroom/" rel="category tag"&gt;Newsroom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
				&lt;/div&gt;
				
&lt;p&gt;HONOLULU — The Hawaiʻi Department of Health (DOH) State Laboratories Division last night confirmed a case of measles in an unvaccinated child under 5 years of age on Oʻahu. The DOH is investigating the case to identify those who might have been exposed and is working with them to prevent the spread of disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The child had recently returned from international travel with its parents. The child developed a fever, runny nose and cough shortly after returning to Hawaiʻi, sought medical care after breaking out in a rash, and is now recovering at home. A household member with similar symptoms is also being evaluated for possible measles infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Members of the public may have been exposed to measles if they visited the following locations during the specified times:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;C gates, customs and baggage claim area on March 30 between 10:50 a.m. and 2 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terminal 2 departures, TSA checkpoints and gate area for Delta flight 309 to Atlanta, Georgia, on April 4 between 1 and 7 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mānoa Valley District Park art class &lt;/strong&gt;on April 1, between 9 to 10 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Queen’s Island Urgent Care Kapahulu &lt;/strong&gt;on April 4, between 8 a.m. to noon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Flight notifications have been issued for the airlines and airports through which the confirmed and suspected cases traveled. The DOH is also reaching out directly to individuals who had known contact with the confirmed or suspected case.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you were at one of the above locations on the day and time specified:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not vaccinated?&lt;/strong&gt; If you have never received a measles-containing vaccine (either the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine or a measles-only vaccine which is available in other countries), you may be at risk of developing measles.&lt;strong&gt; Anyone who was exposed and considered to be at risk of developing measles should contact their healthcare provider immediately. &lt;/strong&gt;Vaccine or immune globulin can be given to prevent measles if received shortly after exposure.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be vigilant. &lt;/strong&gt;Watch for symptoms&lt;strong&gt; until three weeks after your last exposure.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If you notice the symptoms of measles, immediately isolate yourself by staying home.&lt;/strong&gt; Contact your healthcare provider right away. &lt;strong&gt;Call ahead before going to your healthcare provider’s office or the emergency room &lt;/strong&gt;to notify them that you may have been exposed to measles and ask them to call the local health department. This call will help protect other patients and staff.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immunocompromised?&lt;/strong&gt; Anyone with an immunocompromising condition should consult with their healthcare provider if they have questions or develop symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Already vaccinated?&lt;/strong&gt; If you have received two doses of a measles-containing vaccine, or were born before 1957, you are protected and do not need to take any action.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another dose?&lt;/strong&gt; If you have received only one dose of a measles-containing vaccine, you are very likely to be protected and your risk of being infected with measles from any of these exposures is very low. However, to achieve complete immunity, contact your healthcare provider about getting a second vaccine dose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A medical advisory will be issued to healthcare providers statewide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highly contagious&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Measles is one of the most highly contagious viruses in the world. It spreads by direct contact with an infected person or through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. An infected person can spread measles to others from four days before developing the rash through four days afterward. The virus can remain in the air for up to two hours after an infected person has left the room.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms of measles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms typically include fever of greater than 101 F, runny nose, watery red eyes and a cough. These symptoms usually start seven to 14 days after being exposed. Three to five days after symptoms start, a rash begins to appear on the face and spread to the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to protect yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The best protection against measles is the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. All children should receive two doses of the MMR vaccine. The first dose is given at age 12-15 months and the second dose at 4-6 years of age. If you are planning travel, consult your healthcare provider to determine whether an additional or earlier dose of MMR is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All adults born during or after 1957 should also have documentation of at least one MMR vaccination, unless they have had a blood test showing they are immune to measles or have had the disease. Certain adults at higher risk of exposure to measles (e.g., post-secondary school students, international travelers and healthcare personnel) need a second dose of MMR vaccine, at least four weeks after the first dose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are exposed and not protected&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you are not protected against measles and are exposed to someone with the disease, contact your healthcare provider immediately:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;• The MMR vaccine may prevent or lessen the severity of measles if given with 72 hours of exposure&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;• Immune globulin (a blood product containing antibodies to the measles virus) may prevent or lessen the severity of measles if given within six days of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you are not protected against measles, believe you have been exposed and cannot reach your healthcare provider promptly, please call the DOH Disease Reporting Line at 808-586-4586, or call the Disease Investigation Branch at 808-586-8362.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is no specific treatment for measles. Care of patients with measles consists mainly of ensuring adequate intake of fluids, bed rest and fever control. Patients with complications may need treatment specific to their problem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Contact your healthcare provider to get the MMR vaccine, or locate a vaccine provider at &lt;a href="https://www.vaccines.gov/en/"&gt;https://www.vaccines.gov/en/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

When exposed to harmful bacteria, the worms adapted by rewiring the roles of key neurons and neuromodulators to reduce feeding and resist quiescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One neuropeptide, FLP-13, flipped its usual function depending on whether worms faced stress or infection. These findings show that animals can flexibly reuse the same neural components in different combinations to cope with diverse environmental challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Repurposing:&lt;/strong&gt; Neurons and peptides changed functions during infection, revealing unexpected brain flexibility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FLP-13 Flip:&lt;/strong&gt; A single peptide promoted sleep in one context but helped fight lethargy during infection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Survival Strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; Resisting quiescence with FLP-13 extended worm survival against deadly bacteria.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Picower Institute at MIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whether you are a person about town or a worm in a dish, life can throw all kinds of circumstances your way. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you need is a nervous system flexible enough to cope. In a new study, MIT neuroscientists show how even a simple animal can switch many gears in its brain to muster an adaptive response to a deadly infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108504"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and viruses." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/infection-brain-rewiring-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Further experiments showed that FLP-13 acted on a widespread neuropeptide receptor called DMSR-1 to prevent quiescence. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; worms fed on infectious &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/em&gt; bacteria that made them sick (as it does to humans), they responded similarly to many animals including people. They ate less and became more lethargic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers looked across the nervous system to see how that sickness behavior happened, they discovered that the worms had completely revamped the roles of several of its 302 neurons and some of the peptides they secrete across the brain to modulate behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systems that responded to stress in one case or satiety in another became reconfigured to cope with the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a question of how do you adapt to your environment with the highest level of flexibility given the set of neurons and neuromodulators you have,” said postdoc Sreeparna Pradhan, co-lead author of the new study in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;. “How do you make the maximum set of options available to you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research to find out took place in the lab of senior author Steve Flavell, an associate professor in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pradhan, who was supported by a fellowship from MIT’s K. Lisa Yang Brain-Body Center during the work, teamed up with former Flavell lab graduate student Gurrein Madan to lead the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pradhan said the team discovered several surprises in the course of the study including that a neuropeptide called FLP-13completely flipped its function in infected animals versus animals experiencing other forms of stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research had shown that when worms are stressed by heat, a neuron called ALA releases FLP-13 to cause the worms to go into quiescence, a sleep-like state. But when the worms in the new study ate &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/em&gt; bacteria and got sick, a band of other neurons released FLP-13 to fight off quiescence, enabling the worms to survive longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, ALA took on a completely different role during sickness: leading the charge to suppress feeding by emitting a different group of peptides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A comprehensive approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how the worms responded to infection, the team tracked many features of the worms’ behavior for days as the worms fought the infections and as the researchers made genetic manipulations to probe the underlying mechanisms at play. They also recorded activity across the whole brains of sick animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of a comprehensive observation and experimentation is difficult to achieve in more complex animals, but &lt;em&gt;C. elegans’&lt;/em&gt; relative simplicity makes it a tractable testbed, Pradhan said. The team’s approach also is what allowed it to make so many unexpected findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Pradhan didn’t suspect that the ALA neuron would turn out to be the neuron that suppressed feeding, but when she observed their behavior for long enough, she started to realize the reduced feeding arose from the worms taking little breaks in that they wouldn’t normally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So as she and Madan were manipulating more than a dozen genes they thought might be affecting sickness behavior and feeding in the worm, she included another called &lt;em&gt;ceh-17&lt;/em&gt; that she had read about years ago that seemed to promote bouts of “microsleep” in the worms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they knocked out &lt;em&gt;ceh-17&lt;/em&gt;, they found that those worms didn’t reduce feeding when they got infected, unlike normal animals. It just so happens that &lt;em&gt;ceh-17&lt;/em&gt; is specifically needed for ALA to function properly, so that’s when the team realized ALA might be involved in the feeding reduction behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To know for sure, they then knocked out the various peptides that ALA releases and saw that when they knocked out three in particular, &lt;em&gt;flp-24, nlp-8&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;flp-7&lt;/em&gt;, infected worms didn’t exhibit reduced feeding upon infection. That clinched that ALA drives the reduced feeding sickness behavior by emitting those three peptides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Pradhan and Madan’s screens also revealed that when infected worms were missing &lt;em&gt;flp-13&lt;/em&gt;, they would go into a quiescence state much sooner than infected worms with the peptide available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the worms that fought off the quiescence state lived longer. They found that fighting off quiescence depended on the FLP-13 coming from four neurons (I5, I1, ASH and OLL) but not from ALA. Further experiments showed that FLP-13 acted on a widespread neuropeptide receptor called DMSR-1 to prevent quiescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last major surprise of the study was that the quiescence that &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/em&gt; infection induces in worms is not the same as other forms of sleepiness that show up in other contexts, such as after satiety or heat stress. In those cases, worms don’t wake easily (with a little poke), but amid infection their quiescence was readily reversible. It seemed more like lethargy than sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the lab’s ability image all neural activity during behavior, Pradhan and Madan discerned that a neuron called ASI was particularly active during the bouts of lethargy. That observation solidified further when they showed that ASI’s secretion of the peptide DAF-7 was required for the quiescence to emerge in infected animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all, the study showed that the worms repurpose and reconfigure—sometimes to the point of completely reversing—the functions of neurons and peptides to mount an adaptive response to infection versus a different problem like stress. The results therefore shed light on what has been a tricky question to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do brains use their repertoire of cells, circuits and neuromodulators to deal with what life hands them? At least part of the answer, seems to be by reshuffling existing components rather than creating unique ones for each situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How combinations of neuromodulators released from different neuronal sources control the diverse internal states that animals exhibit remains an open question,” the scientists wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The states of stress, satiety and infection are not induced by unique sets of neuromodulators. Instead, one larger set of neuromodulators may be deployed from different sources and in different combinations to specify these different internal states.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Pradhan, Madan and Flavell the paper’s other authors are Di Kang, Eric Bueno, Adam Atanas, Talya Kramer, Ugur Dag, Jessica Lage, Matthew Gomes, Alicia Kun-Yang Lu and Jungyeon Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Support for the research came from the The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, the Freedom Together Foundation, the K.

Upon infection by the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; PA14, &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; decrease feeding, then display reversible bouts of quiescence, and eventually die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ALA neuron and its neuropeptides FLP-7, FLP-24, and NLP-8, which control stress-induced sleep in uninfected animals, promote the PA14-induced feeding reduction. However, the ALA neuropeptide FLP-13 instead delays quiescence and death in infected animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cell-specific genetic perturbations show that the neurons that release FLP-13 to delay quiescence in infected animals are distinct from ALA. A brain-wide imaging screen reveals that infection-induced quiescence involves ASI and DAF-7/TGF-beta, which control satiety-induced quiescence in uninfected animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that a common set of neuromodulators are recruited across different physiological states, acting from distinct neural sources and in distinct combinations to drive state-dependent behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 22:21:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTFBFajJ4Z0tUX1g3WWNSTmZhMmNtVHFkemdmWEVudTFVY1VwcENZV1N3TE9kOTZtb3IyQUNDdmV2Q21ESWR2WjJBcTRjcGJMM21yRFQ1T19uc3dPX3FncGdUNjB0WkhqWHZFeXdvYw</guid></item><item><title>What will it take to get measles under control? - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE43blBPSVdjUWNGcEpVVndFcmhpV3dEWjJXNjZYYmZDanpoOVZXQjVic2RqX0tCSkhEZDJlRUR0bEd3cjM1clgxLXdzN05oanpNT2RzUndiLWdDNVJwc3VTSkhWYkU5aW5RbHZGOTZXbTNwUngwV01uVlRiSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;It's been 25 years since measles was officially "eliminated" from the United States. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's a technical term. In public health, it means measles has not had a steady twelve month spread. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Right now there are measles cases in several states The biggest number of cases are in West Texas where two kids have died. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A quarter of a century after measles was officially eliminated in the US, the disease is once again spreading in West Texas, New Mexico and there are cases in several other states. What can be done to get the virus under control? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that it improves energy production and eases stress within nerve cells, helping maintain muscle function and slow degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the body absorbs kaempferol poorly, and massive quantities would be needed for therapeutic effects through diet alone. Scientists are now developing lipid-based nanoparticles to deliver the compound more effectively to the brain and nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroprotective Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Kaempferol boosts energy production and reduces cell stress in ALS-affected neurons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absorption Challenge:&lt;/strong&gt; The body poorly absorbs dietary kaempferol, limiting its therapeutic potential.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nanoparticle Delivery:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers aim to encapsulate kaempferol in lipid nanoparticles to improve absorption and target neurons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Missouri&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A natural compound found in everyday fruits and vegetables may hold the key to protecting nerve cells — and it’s showing promise as a potential treatment for ALS and dementia, according to new research from the University of Missouri.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s exciting to discover a naturally occurring compound that may help people suffering from ALS or dementia,” Smita Saxena, a professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the School of Medicine and lead author of the study, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108496"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and kale." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/kale-compound-ALS-Alzheimer-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Despite its challenges, kaempferol remains a promising candidate for treating ALS, especially since it works even after symptoms start.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found this compound had a strong impact in terms of maintaining motor and muscle function and reducing muscle atrophy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study discovered that kaempferol, a natural antioxidant found in certain fruits and vegetables, such as kale, berries and endives, may support nerve cell health and holds promise as a potential treatment for ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;n lab-grown nerve cells from ALS patients, the compound helped the cells produce more energy and eased stress in the protein-processing center of the cell called the endoplasmic reticulum. Additionally, the compound improved overall cell function and slowed nerve cell damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that kaempferol worked by targeting a crucial pathway that helps control energy production and protein management — two functions that are disrupted in individuals with ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe this is one of the first compounds capable of targeting both the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria simultaneously,” Saxena said. “By interacting with both of these components within nerve cells, it has the potential to elicit a powerful neuroprotective effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The challenge&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The catch? The body doesn’t absorb kaempferol easily, and it could take a large amount to see real benefits in humans. For instance, an individual with ALS would need to consume at least 10-11 pounds of kale in a day to obtain a beneficial dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our bodies don’t absorb kaempferol very well from the vegetables we eat,” Saxena said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because of this, only a small amount reaches our tissues, limiting how effective it can be. We need to find ways to increase the dose of kaempferol or modify it so it’s absorbed into the bloodstream more easily.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another hurdle is getting the compound into the brain. The blood-brain barrier — a tightly locked layer of cells that blocks harmful substances — also makes it harder for larger molecules like kaempferol to pass through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its challenges, kaempferol remains a promising candidate for treating ALS, especially since it works even after symptoms start. It also shows potential for other neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make the compound easier for the body to absorb, Saxena’s team at the Roy Blunt NextGen Precision Health building is exploring ways to boost its uptake by neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One promising approach involves packaging lipid-based nanoparticles — tiny spherical particles made of fats that are commonly used in drug delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The idea is to encapsulate kaempferol within lipid-based nanoparticles that are easily absorbed by the neurons,” Saxena said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This would target kaempferol to neurons to greatly increase its beneficial effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team is currently generating the nanoparticles with hopes of testing them by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Alzheimer’s disease and ALS research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://missouri.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sara Diedrich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://missouri.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Missouri&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Sara Diedrich – University of Missouri&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://actaneurocomms.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40478-025-01927-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kaempferol enhances ER-mitochondria coupling and protects motor neurons from mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress in C9ORF72-ALS&lt;/a&gt;” by Smita Saxena et al. &lt;em&gt;Acta Neuropathologica Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kaempferol enhances ER-mitochondria coupling and protects motor neurons from mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress in C9ORF72-ALS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeat expansions in the &lt;em&gt;C9ORF72&lt;/em&gt; gene are a frequent cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. Considerable progress has been made in identifying &lt;em&gt;C9ORF72&lt;/em&gt;-mediated disease and resolving its underlying etiopathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contributions of intrinsic mitochondrial deficits as well as chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress to the development of the&lt;em&gt; C9ORF72&lt;/em&gt;-linked pathology are well established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, to date, no cure or effective therapy is available, and thus attempts to find a potential drug target, have received increasing attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we investigated the mode of action and therapeutic effect of a naturally occurring dietary flavanol, kaempferol in preclinical rodent and human models of &lt;em&gt;C9ORF72&lt;/em&gt;-ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, kaempferol treatment of &lt;em&gt;C9ORF72&lt;/em&gt;-ALS human patient-derived motor neurons/neurons, resolved mitochondrial deficits, promoted resiliency against severe ER stress, and conferred neuroprotection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment of symptomatic &lt;em&gt;C9ORF72&lt;/em&gt; mice with kaempferol, normalized mitochondrial calcium uptake, restored mitochondria function, and diminished ER stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, in vivo, chronic kaempferol administration ameliorated pathological motor dysfunction and inhibited motor neuron degeneration, highlighting the translational potential of kaempferol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, in silico modelling identified a novel kaempferol target and mechanistically the neuroprotective mechanism of kaempferol is through the iP3R-VDAC1 pathway via the modulation of GRP75 expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, kaempferol holds great promise for treating neurodegenerative diseases where both mitochondrial and ER dysfunction are causally linked to the pathophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 21:41:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFBtMzZVRURMT3lteXJfb0ZDSE9Pakd5UVVHTElvMmFvVkUzcXV4NGY5WmJZdmVYTEpvc1k3VWNudFpsa2lYdThGWkRwRDZ1YVExV0FKVGRDNHAxZWo5NzVGOVdJbFRQb2NON3FkSWp3</guid></item><item><title>Low Vitamin K Intake May Accelerate Age-Related Memory Decline - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiakFVX3lxTE9rYkFQYWktdWY0MGRsbkYxLWd5WU9WMWQ0blRaNzF5N2YwTnlYZkpEdzhNOXk2TlBPNlM5X185VWg3NHdsc1dSVkdRaDh1aFVZOF9CbnlDU05oSF9xTjFLNXhmLU1BWEt3blE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study reveals that insufficient vitamin K may harm brain health and memory as we age. In rodent models, a vitamin K-deficient diet led to increased brain inflammation and fewer newly formed neurons in the hippocampus—key factors in learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice with low vitamin K struggled with memory and spatial learning tasks, indicating clear cognitive deficits. Researchers stress the importance of a healthy diet rich in leafy greens rather than relying on supplements to support brain health during aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impaired Memory:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice on a low-vitamin K diet performed poorly on memory and learning tests.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Neurogenesis:&lt;/strong&gt; Vitamin K deficiency decreased new neuron formation in the hippocampus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Inflammation:&lt;/strong&gt; Deficient mice showed more activated microglia, indicating brain inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Tufts University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As scientists seek to unravel the intricate potential connections between nutrition and the aging brain, a new study from researchers at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging (HNRCA) at Tufts University is shedding light on how insufficient consumption of vitamin K may adversely affect cognition as people get older. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, conducted in middle-aged rodents, suggests that a lack of vitamin K may increase inflammation and hamper proliferation of neural cells in the hippocampus, a portion of the brain that is capable of generating new cells and is central to functions such as learning and memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108492"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain surrounded by vitamin K rich foods." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vitamin-K-brain-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Vitamin K is found in green leafy vegetables such as Brussels sprouts, broccoli, green peas, kale, and spinach. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin K is found in green leafy vegetables such as Brussels sprouts, broccoli, green peas, kale, and spinach. It is already known to play an essential role in blood clotting, and research suggests it may also have positive effects on cardiovascular health as well as joint health, says Sarah Booth, director of the HNRCA and senior author of the study. Booth is also a professor at the Gerald J. and Dorothy R. Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is also research that indicates vitamin K contributes to brain function and that brain function declines during the aging process,” says Tong Zheng, lead author of the study and a research scientist at the HNRCA.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vitamin K seems to have a protective effect. Our research is trying to understand the underlying mechanism for that effect, so that we might one day be able to target those mechanisms specifically.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Learning and Memory Affected&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new research, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;, researchers conducted a six-month dietary intervention to compare the cognitive performance of mice that were fed a low-vitamin K diet and those receiving a standard diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team focused on menaquinone-4, a form of vitamin K prevalent in brain tissue, and found significantly lower levels of this nutrient in the brains of the vitamin K-deficient mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This deficiency is associated with noticeable cognitive decline as measured in a series of behavioral tests designed to assess their learning and memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one such test, the novel object recognition test, the vitamin K-deficient mice showed a diminished ability to distinguish between familiar and new objects, a clear indication of impaired memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a second test, to measure spatial learning, the mice were tasked with learning the location of a hidden platform in a pool of water. The vitamin K-deficient mice took considerably longer to learn the task compared to their counterparts with adequate vitamin K levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers then examined the mice brain tissue, they found significant changes within the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, they observed a reduced number of proliferating cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in the vitamin K-deficient mice. This decrease translated to fewer newly generated immature neurons, a process known as neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Neurogenesis is thought to play a critical role in learning and memory, and its impairment could directly contribute to the cognitive decline observed in the study,” Zheng says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding another layer of complexity, the researchers also found evidence of increased neuroinflammation in the brains of the vitamin K-deficient mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found a higher number of activated microglia, which are the major immune cells in the brain,” says Zheng.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While microglia play a vital role in maintaining brain health, their overactivation can lead to chronic inflammation, which is increasingly recognized as a key factor in age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Healthy Diet &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Booth and Zheng emphasize that their research doesn’t mean that people should rush out and start taking vitamin K supplements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People need to eat a healthy diet,” says Booth. “They need to eat their vegetables.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Booth noted that the Tufts team works closely with Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, with the Rush team conducting observational studies in humans of brain health and cognition, while Tufts focuses on models to study specific mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that a healthy diet works, and that people who don’t eat a healthy diet don’t live as long or do as well cognitively,” says Booth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By choreographing animal and human studies together, we can do a better job of improving brain health long-term by identifying and targeting specific mechanisms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and brain aging research news&lt;a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2022/12/07/tufts-researchers-find-brains-more-vitamin-d-function-better"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://now.tufts.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Julie Rafferty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://now.tufts.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tufts University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Julie Rafferty – Tufts University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjnut.2025.01.023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Low Vitamin K Intake Impairs Cognition, Neurogenesis, and Elevates Neuroinflammation in C57BL/6 Mice&lt;/a&gt;” by Tong Zheng et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low Vitamin K Intake Impairs Cognition, Neurogenesis, and Elevates Neuroinflammation in C57BL/6 Mice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0015"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to its important roles in blood coagulation and bone formation, vitamin K (VK) contributes to brain function. Low dietary VK intake, which is common among older adults, is associated with age-related cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0020"&gt;Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying VK’s effects on cognition, we investigated the effects of low VK (LVK) intake on cognition in C57BL/6 mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0025"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male and female 9-mo-old C57BL/6 mice (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 60) were fed an LVK diet or a control diet for 6 mo. Behavioral tests were performed on a subset of mice (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 26) at 15 mo, and brain tissues were collected for follow-up analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0030"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menaquinone-4, the predominant VK form in the brain, was significantly lower in LVK mice compared to controls (15.6 ± 13.3 compared with 189 ± 186 pmol/g, respectively, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). LVK mice showed reduced recognition memory in the novel object test by spending a lower percentage of time exploring the novel object compared to controls (47.45% ± 4.17 compared with 58.08% ± 3.03, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.04).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also spent a significantly longer time learning the task of locating the platform in the Morris water maze test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the hippocampal dentate gyrus, LVK mice had a significantly lower number of proliferating cells and fewer newly generated immature neurons compared to control mice. Additionally, more activated microglia cells were identified in the LVK mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0035"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data indicate that LVK intake reduced menaquinone-4 concentrations in brain tissues and impaired learning- and memory-related cognitive function. This impairment may be related to the observed reduced hippocampal neurogenesis and elevated neural inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 21:21:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE9rYkFQYWktdWY0MGRsbkYxLWd5WU9WMWQ0blRaNzF5N2YwTnlYZkpEdzhNOXk2TlBPNlM5X185VWg3NHdsc1dSVkdRaDh1aFVZOF9CbnlDU05oSF9xTjFLNXhmLU1BWEt3blE</guid></item><item><title>Diabetes 'rewires' the brain in surprising way, study finds - Fox News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxOQVFSYjg2dllXVW1hblBUc0VGX24zSkxMM1ZKQjhKZmlId3JnZTRMSVptWFVNX0F5Qkpvb3ZKSVhlY19ZZW96N0FVQTR2blRFSzNWWHRYTnJIaUNrSzRYcnhpVG05UkZveXVVZ0VaNFRlZHNTTGcwYXdvYXN3Q1F4aHU1MVhRcUXSAYwBQVVfeXFMT2RqT0t5T1dZbm5tckdPSTdQSkZ2ellXeEpsZmJtY09oUXlZQm5xaGdUZUdBbWpHcmRjRjZSQWhQRXV5UGJDSndRTl9EVHpyamNUTk9udWZLTWo0TXp4aUowc281ZjRKNU5TdW1DRFUzN1hOVWRyM25ORnc0a2VicTJaR3FxVl9XV0lwRWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;&lt;div class="featured featured-video video-ct" data-v-5f342d4c&gt;

&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;Diabetes is known to cause many medical issues, from &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; to vision problems — and now a new study suggests it could also impact memory and other cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;After observing brain activity and behavior in rodent models, researchers at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) determined that type 2 diabetes can "rewire" the brain in ways similar to early-onset Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Diabetes may be altering the brain similarly to early stages of &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nervous-system-health/alzheimers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;," said lead researcher and UNLV psychology professor James Hyman in the release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/diabetes-risk-lowered-eating-surprisingly-sweet-food-study-shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;DIABETES RISK LOWERED BY EATING ONE SURPRISINGLY SWEET FOOD, STUDY SUGGESTS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Further research is needed, but these findings have the potential to help researchers unlock clues to improved diagnostic or treatment strategies for the disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Diabetes has been shown to impact memory and other cognitive functions.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in The Journal of Neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that people with type 2 diabetes have a higher risk of developing &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nervous-system-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;neurodegenerative disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;&lt;p class="quote-text"&gt;"Diabetes may be altering the brain similarly to early stages of Alzheimer’s disease."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason, the researchers hypothesized, is that high blood sugar levels may impact the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a part of the brain that is involved in cognitive and emotional functions, according to a UNLV press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ACC is linked to key cognitive processes like motivation, decision-making, goal-tracking, pleasure-seeking, reward processing and regulation of emotions, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/diabetes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;people with diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, high blood sugar impairs reward signals from the hippocampus (the part of the brain that controls memory and learning) to the ACC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/weight-loss-diabetes-drugs-linked-vision-problems-small-study"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;WEIGHT-LOSS, DIABETES DRUGS LINKED TO VISION PROBLEMS IN SMALL STUDY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rewards, or achieving goals, are important to helping us make future decisions, so if our brains are responding differently, it's likely our future decisions will be different," Hyman told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This has big implications for those managing their type 2 diabetes, since compliance with testing and lifestyle changes are key aspects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers determined that type 2 diabetes can "rewire" the brain in ways similar to early-onset Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could also explain why it is so hard for many people to stick with new diets and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/fitness" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;exercise regimens&lt;/a&gt;, Hyman noted, because their brains don't respond to normally rewarding events due to the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This knowledge can help people persevere and remain diligent, since their failures are not due to personal weakness, but altered brain physiology," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;&lt;p class="quote-text"&gt;"This kind of research opens new avenues not just for Alzheimer's patients, but also for other diseases that impact the brain."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Adam Scioli, chief medical officer at Caron Treatment Centers in Pennsylvania, said it is known that the reward system of the brain helps to imprint memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It makes sense that any substance – like sugar – that impacts and overwhelms that reward system can have lasting impacts on cognitive and working memory," Scioli, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept of reward and memory in type 2 diabetes has some &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/addiction" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;similarities to addiction&lt;/a&gt;, according to the expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Both conditions also involve altered hippocampus-ACC connectivity, which affects goal-oriented behavior and memory processing," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt;

It's possible those other aspects may have different, either compounding or allaying, impacts." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyman’s team plans to conduct further research into the connection between diabetes and brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;&lt;p class="quote-text"&gt;"Be patient and understand that the disease has rewired your brain."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Alzheimer’s disease goes undetected for decades because our brains are good at finding ways to compensate," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Before diagnosis, people behave normally despite having changes in information processing. We even observed that in this study."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Based on these findings, the researchers recommend that people monitor their own blood glucose levels. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on these findings, Hyman hopes that people will be more likely to monitor their own blood glucose levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, be sure to follow &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;doctors’ orders&lt;/a&gt; closely and keep blood glucose levels stable," he advised. "We think it's the spikes of extremely low and high blood glucose that make people more vulnerable to Alzheimer's."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those having trouble with lifestyle changes, Hyman urged them to "not be so hard on yourself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Be patient and understand that the disease has rewired your brain."&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="article-meta"&gt;&lt;div class="author-bio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melissa Rudy is senior health editor and a member of the lifestyle team at Fox News Digital.

"I worry that people are afraid to get measles tested or to bring their kid in for care."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"My other worry is we still want people to take prevention measures and, of course, we know the vaccine is not only the safest way, but also the most effective way to prevent infection with measles," she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;Kennedy promotes catch-all treatments not intended for all measles cases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In a &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1909049021211263268" target="_blank"&gt;second social media post on Sunday evening&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy shared that he had met the families of the two school-aged children who died of measles in Texas, as well as a third family who reportedly had a daughter in the ICU for three weeks with measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Kennedy said he also met with two physicians who have "treated and healed" about 300 children infected with measles in the Mennonite community with aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;A vial of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is on display at the Lubbock Health Department, on Feb. 26, 2025, in Lubbock, Texas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;Mary Conlon/AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Aerosolized budesonide is a steroid used to reduce inflammation in the lungs, making it easier to breathe.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Baked potato chips aren’t necessarily “healthier” than regular chips.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The baked chips are typically processed and “predigested,” so they contain less nutrients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try looking for regular potato chips with just three ingredients: potatoes, oil and salt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nutritious snack choices are an important part of a healthy eating pattern. Handfuls of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8027688/are-nuts-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nuts&lt;/a&gt; and dried fruits are fiber-packed and can help keep you satisfied—but sometimes you just want a bag of potato chips, and that’s totally OK too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But if you think choosing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/are-baked-chips-healthier-for-you-8425818" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;baked potato chips&lt;/a&gt; over regular chips is the obvious healthier choice, you may be mistaken. In a recent interview segment for &lt;em&gt;This Morning&lt;/em&gt;, gut health expert and dietitian Megan Rossi, Ph.D., RD, shares the difference between the snacks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “We look at the ingredients lists, really interestingly, the legit ones have got potato, [but] the baked ones typically have potato flakes, which means it’s kind of ultra-processed potato, kind of pre-digested,” she explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed mntl-sc-block-embed--instagram"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What Rossi means by the snack being a pre-digested food is that the baked chips are processed by breaking down a whole food (i.e. potato into potato flakes) which in turn can eliminate nutrients from the natural food source.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So although the calorie and saturated fat count for baked chips may be a little lower than regular varieties, they contain less vitamins and minerals like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069581/what-does-potassium-do/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt; and vitamin C. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “And often [baked chips] add extra flavors and added sugars,” Rossi notes. This can also be noted for other flavored regular chips—we’re looking at you, sour cream and onion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s important to remember that all foods and drinks—including regular chips or baked chips—can be included in a healthy eating pattern when done so in moderation. But unless you have a preference for the baked chips, it’s best to stick to the tried-and-true standard potato chips with a minimal ingredient list. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Try to get the ones with just three ingredients: potato, oil and some salt,” the dietitian says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potato chips are also easy (and dare we say, more delicious) to make at home. From &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/251600/microwave-potato-chips/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Microwave Potato Chips&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/270403/air-fryer-sweet-potato-chips/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Air-Fryer Sweet Potato Chips&lt;/a&gt;, the crispy snack is an easy DIY, and you can control the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7981788/low-sodium-foods-list/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;sodium&lt;/a&gt; content and customize the seasoning when making them from scratch.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Slipping vaccination rates in West Texas have led to the state's largest measles outbreak in over 30 years, with more than 500 patients affected as of April 8 and cases spreading to New Mexico and Oklahoma. Last week, an unvaccinated Texas child died from measles, marking the third death tied to the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Public health experts say there is a playbook for slowing outbreaks like this one: Identify cases. Isolate patients. Track where they've been and who they may have exposed. Most of all, drive up the vaccination rate.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That's the way to stop it. This only ends with immunity," said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at The Brown University School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;This strategy isn't novel. The benefits of measles vaccination have been well-established for more than half a century. The emergence of the vaccine in the 1960s meant parents no longer had to accept the risks of serious complications or death that came with the common childhood disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By 2000, measles was considered eliminated in the U.S. — thanks to vaccination. But misinformation about the vaccine began to spread &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/13/1231104444/the-anti-vaccine-movement" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;around the same time&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Katherine Wells, director of public health in Lubbock, the largest city in the West Texas region affected by the outbreak, said she is seeing the impact of that misinformation today.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Talking to the community, they really stopped vaccinating about 20 years ago, which is in line with what we've seen in other communities across the United States," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The vaccine is safe and effective, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with rare and usually mild side effects.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yet U.S. vaccination rates have dipped for everything from measles to flu over the past five years, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/interactive/general-population-coverage.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CDC data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Texas, measles immunization rates in the state and kindergarteners dropped around two and a half percent between 2019 and 2023, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The same is true at the national level, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CDC data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Gaines County, the epicenter of the West Texas outbreak, only around 82% of kindergarteners were vaccinated for measles in the 2023-24 school year, compared to the 95% recommended by the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to maintain herd immunity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Wells also said she and her colleagues have ramped up testing and vaccination efforts in the area, with some success.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, it's an uphill battle.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The uptake for vaccines has … definitely been a struggle. I want to be honest with that," Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She said her department is following the established measles playbook: conducting contact tracing, letting the public know about possible exposures and encouraging isolation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Unless Texas declares a public health emergency, local officials can't take more aggressive steps, like preemptively quarantining unvaccinated kids.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Chris Van Deusen, director of media relations for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said there are no plans to declare an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-58650" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conflicting language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the outbreak grows, a range of bills aimed at loosening vaccine mandates are being considered by the Republican-controlled Texas Legislature.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And at the national level, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has at times downplayed the importance of vaccines and promoted unproven alternative treatments for measles.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In an op-ed published last month, he &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/07/nx-s1-5354900/hhs-rfk-endorses-mmr-measles-vaccine-stoking-supporters-fury" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;suggested vitamin A &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;could "dramatically reduce measles mortality."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And while the American Academy of Pediatrics does recommend two doses of vitamin A for children to relieve measles symptoms, especially if they're so sick they're hospitalized, vitamin A is not a cure and does not prevent transmission of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After a second child in Texas died from measles last weekend, Kennedy said in a &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1908967854394982414%7Ctwgr%5E7301ea2c495eb45b0b1b74b00d52e2e24f5c5eb0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tpr.org%2Fpublic-health%2F2025-04-07%2Frfk-jr-visits-west-texas-after-second-child-dies-of-measles" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;social media statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he had traveled to visit the child's family. He said in the statement that vaccines are the most effective defense against this disease.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Nuzzo said conflicting messaging adds a layer of difficulty for health professionals responding to the outbreak on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think the federal communications is muddying the waters and making the jobs that the local officials have in responding to this outbreak harder," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Proposed federal funding cuts are also shaping up to be an obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In March, the Department of Government Efficiency announced it would terminate hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to the Texas Department of State Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Van Deusen said the agency has notified more than 50 local health departments to stop spending funds under the affected federal awards — some of which have been used for immunization programs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lacey Nobles, Lubbock's director of communications, said the city is still assessing what the impact of those lost funds will be locally.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As the confirmed cases in Texas surpass 500, Wells is bracing for a long road.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is going to be a large outbreak, and we are still on the side where we are increasing the number of cases," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She expects it to be a year before the case count is back to zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

I cried hysterically while holding my three-and-a-half-month-old baby, praying she wouldn't have to grow up without a mom.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Susan Ash, now 25, pictured above with daughter Julia who was born in July 2024. Shortly after the birth, Ms Ash was diagnosed with a brain tumor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is a picture of the scan of Ms Ash' brain, with the tumor shown by the yellow lines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'In retrospect, as a new parent I wasn't connecting the dots and truthfully wasn't concerned about this — I assumed it was stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But when I went back to work seven weeks postpartum, the duration and frequency of these episodes [headaches and blurred vision] was increasing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors found the tumor on her left occipital lobe — the part of the brain at the back of the head responsible for processing visual information from the right eye. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fortunately, the mass was not cancerous, but its location explained the strange flashes Ms Ash had been experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say that during pregnancy, surging hormone levels — particularly estrogen and progesterone — can stimulate the growth of brain tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These hormones can bind to receptors on the tumor itself, potentially accelerating its development, especially if it had been silently growing for years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms. Ash gave birth to her daughter, Julia, in July 2024. Not long after, she began experiencing vision changes and persistent migraines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Concerned but not alarmed, she visited her doctor, who referred her to a neurologist. But when the symptoms seemed to ease after she began taking magnesium supplements, she canceled the appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then in October, while playing soccer with her family, Ms Ash suddenly collapsed mid-game. She had suffered a grand mal seizure — a severe type of seizure that affects the entire brain, causing muscle stiffness and loss of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was rushed to hospital, where imaging scans revealed a marble-sized tumor pressing on her brain. It was also causing irritation within the skull, leading to swelling, compression and intense headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Ash later shared that she had suffered from migraines for years and even recalled episodes of visual disturbances — like flashing lights — as early as age ten. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors now believe these may have been early signs of the tumor’s presence as it slowly grew in silence over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Ash was diagnosed after she suffered a seizure while at a family soccer game. She was rushed to the hospital where scans revealed the tumor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She is pictured above with her partner and daughter Julia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Describing the symptoms after they returned, she said: 'On my right side I would see bright flashing lights that often moved in a circular motion, which would last a couple of minutes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Then once that subsided, my peripheral vision would go blurry.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Ash was given two options by doctors: To either leave the tumor, or take it out and risk losing vision in her right eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has decided to remove it, saying it's worth the risk in case it leads to more problems later. The operation is scheduled to take place in a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Although there is a chance I will lose the vision in my right eye, it is a small price to pay to be alive.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eight months after giving birth, the young mom says the diagnosis and vision problems mean that she now can't drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also says that the seizures have led her to be unable to work, leaving her with financial stress as she navigates motherhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Ash, now 25, has now made it her mission to connect with other people going through similar health battles online, and raising awareness of the early symptoms preceding her diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 90,000 Americans are diagnosed with a brain tumor every year, although they are mostly aged 40 and above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Ash is pictured above with her family. She has opted to have the tumor removed surgically&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors say many patients conditions may have gone undiagnosed for years because their symptoms — like migraines and nausea — can be mistaken for other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Warning signs of a brain tumor include persistent headaches, nausea or vomiting and vision problems such as blurred or double vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Ash added: 'While being diagnosed with a brain tumor three months postpartum is pretty specific, I connect with a lot of people just from sharing how I am feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Fear, anxiety, sadness, anger, grief, gratitude, a positive outlook, happiness in the little moment, pride – all of these things, we, as humans feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Whether someone is gravitating towards my videos for the motherhood side, the medical side or the mental health side, my ultimate goal is for others to not feel alone.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Many of these studies, however, were focused on single ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“In real life, we ingest a mixture of additives,” said Mathilde Touvier, director of the nutritional epidemiology research team at Université Sorbonne Paris Nord and the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, who co-authored the new study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Touvier and her team looked at about eight years of data from more than 108,000 adults from the &lt;a href="https://info.etude-nutrinet-sante.fr/upload/siteinfo/files/ck/files/protocole%20general%20en%20anglais%20NutriNet_Aug2013_EM_03_09_13.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;French NutriNet-Santé cohort&lt;/a&gt;, a long-running study that looks at the links between food and health.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Poring over the participants’ reported diets, the researchers identified five mixtures of additives people commonly consumed together. The combinations don’t look unlike an ingredient list you might find on the label of an ultra-processed food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mixture 1: Sodium carbonates; diphosphates; glycerol; ammonium carbonates; potassium carbonates; sorbitol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mixture 2: Modified starches; pectins; guar gum; carrageenan; polyphosphates; potassium sorbate; curcumin; xanthan gum&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mixture 3: Magnesium carbonates; riboflavin; alpha-tocopherol; ammonium carbonates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mixture 4: Ammonium carbonates; sodium carbonates; diphosphates; alpha-tocopherol; DATEM; magnesium carbonates; lecithins&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mixture 5: Citric acid; sodium citrates; phosphoric acid; sulphite ammonia caramel; acesulfame K; aspartame; sucralose; arabic gum; malic acid; carnauba wax; paprika extract, capsanthin, and capsorubin; anthocyanins; guar gum; pectins &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s relatively uncommon for all of them to appear in a single product, however, it’s entirely possible to consume all of them across different foods throughout the day, especially when eating a variety of processed or ultra-processed foods,” said Mengxi Du, a research associate at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who studies nutrition and health and wasn’t involved with the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Carrageenan and potassium sorbate, two additives in Mixture 2, are found together in sweetened condensed milk. Xanthan gum is commonly found in mayonnaise and gluten-free prepared foods. Pectin is in cream cheese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“These are pretty common products in someone’s fridge and a lot of times we combine them,” Du said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Two groups — Mixture 2 and Mixture 5 — were linked to an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes, the researchers found. People with more of these combinations in their diet were more likely to develop the disease, regardless of how healthy their diet was overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Mixture 2 was heavy in emulsifiers and thickening agents, including carrageenans, which are found in plant-based milks and processed meats, and modified starches, which thicken and stabilize packaged sauces, soups and baked goods. Mixture 5 contained ingredients commonly found in sugary and artificially-sweetened drinks, and included artificial sweeteners, natural dyes and acidifiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Still, the study was observational, meaning it doesn’t show cause and effect. Studies that require participants to recall their diets are also &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41371-023-00818-w" target="_blank"&gt;notoriously tricky&lt;/a&gt;. The limitations make it difficult to draw strong conclusions from the study, which Touvier and her team said will require more research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The additives may be markers of something else, rather than causing Type 2 diabetes themselves,” said Dr. Tom Rifai, an internal and lifestyle medicine doctor in Cleveland Clinic’s department of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism. Rifai owns a lifestyle coaching company that includes nutrition counseling. “These could be a marker for what we call calorie density.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Food additives are ubiquitous in &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-ultraprocessed-foods-public-schools-rcna196935" target="_blank"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, which usually &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ultraprocessed-foods-cause-people-gain-weight-study-finds-n1006456" target="_blank"&gt;pack in many more calories&lt;/a&gt; in much smaller amounts of food than minimally and unprocessed foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“At the very least, these additives are markers of ultra-processing, which we know makes people eat more without realizing they are taking in a lot more calories,” Marion Nestle, a professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The same is true for the three groups of additives that were not found to be linked to diabetes risk. Nestle said that while the study cannot show causation, the results are consistent with “present thinking that additives may well be anything but benign.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Some food additives do play an important role in food safety. Potassium sorbate, for example, stops yeast and fungus from growing in packaged food. Others — including &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(24)00095-0/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;emulsifiers&lt;/a&gt;, which create certain textures, and artificial dyes — have come under scrutiny. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Last month, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-first-month-health-secretary-vaccines-food-additives-rcna196042" target="_blank"&gt;directed&lt;/a&gt; the Food and Drug Administration to review its rule on “generally recognized as safe,” &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fdas-hands-approach-additives-may-allow-unsafe-ingredients-food-expert-rcna165535" target="_blank"&gt;or GRAS&lt;/a&gt;, ingredients. The rule allows manufacturers to add certain additives to food without FDA review. It was originally intended for common ingredients such as salt or vinegar but has come to cover an expansive range of additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In 2023, California became the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-becomes-first-state-ban-four-chemicals-food-red-dye-no-3-rcna119660" target="_blank"&gt;first state to ban&lt;/a&gt; four food additives: brominated vegetable oil, potassium bromate, propylparaben and Red Dye No. 3. In March, &lt;a href="https://governor.wv.gov/article/governor-patrick-morrisey-signs-food-dye-legislation-law" target="_blank"&gt;West Virginia banned seven food dyes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In the first three months of this year, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/food-dyes-ban-rfk-jr-west-virginia-fda-rcna197180" target="_blank"&gt;20 states&lt;/a&gt; — including Illinois, Missouri, New York, Oregon and Pennsylvania — introduced similar bans, but not on any of the additives included in the new study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It’s too early to tell whether food additives, when eaten together, can have a synergistic effect, Du said. It’s possible that one ingredient, safe on its own, may be linked to health problems when combined with other ingredients, for example. Or an ingredient’s mild health effects could be amplified when mixed with other additives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Given that ultra-processed foods account for more than half of the calories an average American eats in a day, research that further investigates such an effect is worthwhile, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 19:23:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxQY09EeHhUd2FXYUh2Q2FXejNMa1JMbTNWSW9yTjBybWlwWW9pR2tqX1YwRXV2NF9ienlHT2MwRkF6VGswc2lQNDQ2cGxyVjBaY2tkd0htQUNfZUJlV0FLdmhRSndqT3kzV3liOWQxaVZUNzdvbXRnLWZ3UzFKdEFsUkktcXA3YUJ4cnFPUkRRRXpHWnpaN2VPTU9TZnZnZmhIWVM3ZkNiMk9pd2RrVGNUWGhFcUtpcGxFb0VhamZSN0VYd9IBVkFVX3lxTE1vakVsbVNDZUg0ZTIwSVJDUzBRRzZ5ZDk3ak5wU0t4em5vRW5OQTFXUGpIXzZueXc5MnczcmdtYVE2aVRVaGZnYVdVV1JCSm9SQjFvVFVR</guid></item><item><title>Woman Dismissed By Doctors After Regular Fainting Had POTS - TODAY.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxNc0g2N2g4X3FvU3pTQVNGV3Y4N2Vqa1E4OThzeGJySTJ0OEZiWTFadFJ1cDV5Yk9PZnVwNWRoeU5IeFQyMmlnalVfZ28zeHcyZk5lV1Z4c2d6eWtSZ3JvVFJjTjB6ZmE1S1U2bEE0NXgwZS0tb09LZ01rQTZub044Umt5UGXSAVRBVV95cUxNZWRWa2M4MHlYaXRWOVpCeUtDRjJoMnZmQTR0RlhqQTF5TllGX1FZSzJBaHhic192SlJXNGxHUjZSbFppSUtIcW9RV3pvbzJPTDVmd08?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Two days after running a marathon Catrina Vargo, then 32, was walking through her living room when she fainted. The next thing she remembers is waking on the couch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I didn’t even know what had just happened,” Vargo, 35, of Pittsburgh, tells TODAY.com. “I talked to a couple of friends in medicine. I went to urgent care. Every single person said the same thing. ‘You just ran a marathon. Your body’s probably tired.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Though she rested, as the doctors recommended, she continued fainting so frequently that it disrupted her life. She visited specialist after specialist and received no answers for why she felt unwell. Eventually, she was diagnosed with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, more commonly known as POTS, which can cause fainting and a racing heartbeats when a person changes position from sitting to standing, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I certainly had a lot of specialists tell me this might be my new normal now,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Fainting and weakness &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When Vargo ran the 2022 Pittsburgh Marathon in early May, something felt off for the lifelong runner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I ended up walking for a little bit,” she says. “It felt like there was no gas in the tank if that makes sense.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Two days later, she fainted for the first time. At first, it seemed as if she was worn down from the marathon. But then she fainted in a store. She visited the emergency room to try to understand why and doctors told her she was fine and she was “probably still recovering.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors said, “Nothing is worrisome. Your heart looks fine. Your vitals look fine. Just go home and rest,” she recalls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-05-87a6c2.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-05-87a6c2.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-05-87a6c2.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-05-87a6c2.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-05-87a6c2.jpg" alt="Catrina Vargo"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Shortly after running the 2022 Pittsburgh Marathon, the third one she completed, Catrina Vargo kept fainting and felt exhausted. Doctors told her that she just needed to rest, but she later learned she had POTS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Catrina Vargo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt; Vargo felt OK for a few days, then fainted again. By the end of May, she felt so exhausted that she struggled to complete daily tasks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I couldn’t walk, couldn’t lift my head. I couldn’t get out of bed. I couldn’t drive a car,” she says. “I couldn’t work. I couldn’t even sit up in the chair and it was like I had lost all of my function.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When Vargo visited doctors, though, they told her there was nothing wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I had probably seen like five or six different ER doctors, specialists, my PCP and everyone kept saying everything was OK,” she recalls. “That was very confusing because … something was obviously wrong. We have no answers but everyone’s telling me, 'Go home and hopefully this gets better.'” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;By June, Vargo needed a wheelchair to help her get around. Frustrated, she wondered if life would always be like this for her now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Each doctor would say, ‘I’m not getting the answers for you. So good luck. Hopefully, you’ll find another specialist that finds the answers,’” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Eventually, a doctor suggested she undergo a tilt table test, which often helps doctors determine the underlying cause of fainting. It works by moving a person on a table to see if different positions cause blacking out. While the test provided some answers, Vargo still faced uncertainty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They were at least able to say something’s happening in your body that’s causing you to faint, and we have proof that it’s happening,” Vargo says. “But they still weren’t able to say for sure what it was.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Around the same time, some of her friends working in medicine mentioned POTS. That prompted her to make an appointment with a cardiologist familiar with POTS. While she waited for that appointment, she struggled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I’m not walking,” Vargo says. “I can’t really do anything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Even making it to the appointment in July 2022 was difficult. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I was wholly in a wheelchair,” she says. “I had to get help to get to the clinic and get help getting out of the wheelchair.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The doctor determined she had POTS from being “pretty depleted from a lot of nutrients.” Running a marathon stressed her body even more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“My nervous system was already not in a great place,” she says. “I basically pushed my body to the limit where my nervous system almost reprogrammed itself to be dysfunctional.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The doctor prescribed a medication that raised her blood pressure to address her blood pressure dipping “significantly” when she stood. But she also started participating in an exercise program that helps POTS patients manage the fainting and weakness they experience. Vargo dedicated herself to it and about a year later, she started feeling more like herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s definitely been a journey,” she says. “I’ll be honest there are some days I can still feel off depending on my stress levels or if I haven’t hydrated (well) that day.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;POTS and exercise &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;People with POTS experience “an exaggerated increase in heart rate” when changing positions such as moving from sitting to standing, Dr. Matthew Tomey, a cardiologist with Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York City, told TODAY.com via email. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“This can be accompanied by an uncomfortable awareness of the accelerated heartbeat (palpitations) or lightheadedness,” he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Other symptoms can include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exhaustion &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An inability to work out also known as exercise intolerance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty breathing &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discomfort in the chest &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;People experience POTS differently with some reporting minor symptoms while others find that “symptoms can be disabling, preventing full participation in work and activities of daily living,” says Tomey, who did not treat Vargo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Experts believe the condition occurs when the cardiovascular and autonomic nervous system fail to work together harmoniously. Still, doctors are investigating why it occurs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The exact mechanism of its pathogenesis (remains) incompletely understood,” Tomey says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While people who experience conditions such as long COVID might also have POTS, Tomey notes it can also appear without a concurrent condition. There’s not one treatment that works universally and doctors often tailor therapies to address each patient. Treatments could include medication, wearing compression garments, focusing on hydration and sodium intake to balance electrolytes and participating in a specialized exercise regimen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The exercise program has several names, including the Levine protocol and the Dallas protocol. It works by slowly increasing one’s endurance to exercise by focusing on boosting the cardiovascular system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“When (these patients are) standing up, they don’t feel good, they’re getting dizzy, they’re lightheaded. Worst case, they’re passing out … A lot of that is because they don’t have enough blood volume getting into their brains,” Mark Jordan, senior clinical exercise physiologist for the cardiopulmonary rehabilitation institute at UPMC Shadyside in Pittsburgh, tells TODAY.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“What exercise could do for you is to help expand the biggest chamber of your heart to allow your body to pump more blood out.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-02-2a52cd.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-02-2a52cd.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-02-2a52cd.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-02-2a52cd.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-02-2a52cd.jpg" alt="Catrina Vargo"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;After a year of physical therapy and some treatments to deal with anemia, Catrina Vargo started feeling like herself following her POTS diagnosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Catrina Vargo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At the same time exercise increases blood flow, it helps train the autonomic nervous system to work properly. When healthy people stand, the autonomic nervous system makes sure the blood flows to the brain so the body can work as it should. In POTS, people experience a disruption to that, causing lightheadedness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The Levine or Dallas Protocol encourages people to participate in “exercise where you’re sitting down and your feet are in front of you,” what’s also known as recumbent exercise, Jordan says. Often patients start with a rowing machine or recumbent bike. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They don’t feel good when they’re upright so we’re not going to do any exercise while they’re upright,” he explains. “We start with short almost moderate-intensity interval training.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Vargo says when she first began, she would row until she felt like she might faint or for about seven minutes. It’s typical for people with POTS to start exercising for short bursts of time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s very very low level moderate intense recumbent exercise with a slow progression over the course of … months,” Jordan says. “It’s going to take at least a couple of months before you might start to notice improvement and it could take six months to a year of consistent exercise to really feel better.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;People slowly find they can row or bike for longer amounts of time. When they feel like they have improved endurance, they can move on to other forms of exercise.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’ll gradually progress you from a recumbent exercise to an upright bike to ultimately fully upright walking or running on a treadmill,” Jordan explains. “Once you get to that point and you’re able to do upright exercise, feeling well, I encourage patients to do what they want.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;If a patient finds that their symptoms return, they can always return to the program, starting with recumbent activity and working up to upright exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They could use it indefinitely … as a guide to know where to start and how to progress,” Jordan says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;‘A balancing act’ &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;About a year after starting physical therapy, Vargo began feeling better. Her doctor noticed her iron levels remained low, and she started receiving injections, which also helped her feel more like herself again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Ever since then it’s been a balance act,” she says. “I need to keep an eye on (my health) and make sure I don’t get lazy with taking care of my body.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Vargo has been able to start running again but she often focuses on activities such as Pilates, yoga, spinning and softball. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The good news is I can push my body back to regular exercise limits, doing exercise five days a week, and can comfortably do that with little issue,” she says. “I’m very grateful to just be able to be back to my life.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She empathizes with people longing for a diagnosis with a “mystery illness” and encourages them to continue to seek help for their health.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“You have to be your own advocate and while that can be really scary and really tiring if you keep searching and calling and making appointments and talking to your network like I was eventually you are able to find people who really care,” she says. “Just keep advocating for yourself.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Vargo wanted to share her story to offer hope to others with POTS. The diagnosis can feel very overwhelming especially because it can feel like there are few options for recovering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-04-ddb19b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-04-ddb19b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-04-ddb19b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-04-ddb19b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/catrina-vago-POTS-mc-250408-04-ddb19b.jpg" alt="Catrina Vargo"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;While she hasn't signed up to run a marathon since her POTS diagnosis, Catrina Vargo has been able to run again thanks to her dedication to physical therapy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Catrina Vargo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“There (are) no stories of people that went through hell and back but now they’re back to living a normal life,” she says. “I always told myself if, when, I recover I want to make sure that a positive story is out there so people don’t give up.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 19:23:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxNc0g2N2g4X3FvU3pTQVNGV3Y4N2Vqa1E4OThzeGJySTJ0OEZiWTFadFJ1cDV5Yk9PZnVwNWRoeU5IeFQyMmlnalVfZ28zeHcyZk5lV1Z4c2d6eWtSZ3JvVFJjTjB6ZmE1S1U2bEE0NXgwZS0tb09LZ01rQTZub044Umt5UGXSAVRBVV95cUxNZWRWa2M4MHlYaXRWOVpCeUtDRjJoMnZmQTR0RlhqQTF5TllGX1FZSzJBaHhic192SlJXNGxHUjZSbFppSUtIcW9RV3pvbzJPTDVmd08</guid></item><item><title>Measles cases in Texas outbreak surpass 500, with 24 new infections confirmed over last 5 days - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxQWkphN3c2OW1tZXpjdC0ydjVuRzlEaWZTVVE5SHh0bHpQT2RvQzh0QUtoWkhjVzNnVGNqRzFDMVVmcm5ZNHdfRm5zcFlHVEY4bUQ1QjJ0Z3V0WE1ac1FsUVpEY1NEcUlqZ2s2eHNGdF80QjFuZ2djcDJhSTZXWWsxR214bEtZTmFtOWtBMzRIOEpCdzlBR2RscjV6YVI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;The measles outbreak in western Texas is continuing to grow, with 24 new cases confirmed over the last five days, according to data published Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Almost all of the cases are in unvaccinated individuals or in individuals whose vaccination status is unknown, according to the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;/a&gt; (DSHS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Three of the 505 cases are among residents who have been vaccinated with one dose of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine.

			&lt;p&gt;Finding a special soulmate and tying the knot is, of course, cause for celebration, but new research highlights a surprising potential downside of getting married: it may significantly increase your &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/major-study-links-15-factors-to-early-dementia-risk"&gt;risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes the findings unexpected is that many previous studies have shown a variety of health benefits to getting married – benefits that include &lt;a href="https://heart.bmj.com/content/104/23/1937"&gt;lower heart disease risk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1047-2797(99)00052-6"&gt;living to an older age&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team behind the latest study, led by researchers from the Florida State University College of Medicine, suggests further investigations will be needed into the reasons why single people may be less likely to get dementia – or perhaps are less likely to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/up-to-13-of-dementia-cases-could-be-a-misdiagnosed-treatable-condition"&gt;have it diagnosed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_157429" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-157429" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/WeddingParty.jpg" alt="Wedding party" class="wp-image-157429 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/WeddingParty.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/WeddingParty-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-157429" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The study challenges previous research into marriage and health. (&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/people-standing-and-sitting-on-chair-during-daytime-lKCpUYu2TDk"&gt;Carlo Buttinoni/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unmarried individuals may have a lower risk of dementia compared to married adults," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70072"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The findings could indicate delayed diagnoses among unmarried individuals or challenge the assumption that marriage protects against dementia."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the stats: the researchers looked at the health records of 24,107 elderly people (with an average age of 71.8 years), across the course of 18 years. These people were split into four groups: married, widowed, divorced, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/there-could-be-a-dangerous-bias-against-single-people-in-cancer-treatment"&gt;never married&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With risk adjustments only for age and sex, individuals who had never married were 40 percent less likely to develop dementia than married people. For those who had been widowed, the drop was 27 percent, and for those who &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/children-of-divorce-face-greater-risk-of-future-stroke-study-reveals"&gt;were divorced&lt;/a&gt;, it was 34 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After factoring in more variables, like education, genetics, and other &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-is-linked-to-stress-and-depression-and-we-may-know-why"&gt;health conditions&lt;/a&gt;, the statistical difference for widowed people went away. However, there was still a 24 percent lower risk for never married people, and 17 percent for those who were divorced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That suggests that some of the discrepancies here are due to factors that aren't related to marital status – and so this isn't proof of direct cause and effect. That said, there's still a noticeable difference in risk for those who have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-why-it-s-better-to-be-single-according-to-science"&gt;stayed single&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons for this association are likely to be many and varied. The researchers suggest single people might be better at keeping up social ties that can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-social-life-could-help-you-stave-off-dementia-for-years-study-finds"&gt;ward off dementia&lt;/a&gt;, while the health impacts &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stressful-life-events-linked-to-alzheimers-biomarkers-study-finds"&gt;of unhappy marriages&lt;/a&gt; should also be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There is some evidence indicating an increase in some domains of well-being, such as happiness and life satisfaction, after divorce and social participation after partner bereavement," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70072"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Never married individuals are also more likely to socialize with friends and neighbors and are more likely to engage in healthier behaviors than their married counterparts."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth acknowledging that other studies have shown that being married may &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/people-who-never-marry-42-higher-risk-of-developing-dementia-single-health"&gt;protect against dementia&lt;/a&gt; – so why the confusion? Variations in the size and diversity of samples, as well as accommodations for different risk factors, might help explain it, but this is clearly a complex issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists in Pennsylvania have created a kind of antiviral chewing gum made from the Australian pea plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Containing a strong antiviral protein, the researches have used it to reduce the viral load in patients’ mouths for both influenza and herpes simplex viruses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seasonal influenza epidemics cause a substantial global disease burden and economic losses exceeding $11.2 billion each year in the United States alone, while the HSV-1 virus, infecting two-thirds of the global population, is not only socially stigmatizing, but the leading cause of infectious blindness in Western countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry Daniell at the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Dental Medicine, has replicated work he undertook &lt;a href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/chewing-gum-could-reduce-the-spread-of-covid-19-says-new-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; to create a chewing gum with the potential to neutralize viruses, reasoning that the viruses are spread more significantly from the oral rather than the nasal cavity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Made from&lt;em&gt; Lablab purpureus, &lt;/em&gt;which naturally contain an antiviral trap protein called FRIL, the gum was shown in a study to neutralize two herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1 and HSV-2) and two influenza A strains (H1N1 and H3N2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/fulltext/S1525-0016(24)00808-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1525001624008086%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; study published&lt;/a&gt; in Molecular Therapy, Daniell and collaborators in Finland, demonstrated that 40 milligrams of a two-gram bean gum tablet was adequate to reduce viral loads by more than 95%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These observations augur well for evaluating bean gum in human clinical studies to minimize virus infection/transmission,” Daniell said, &lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/penn-dental-antiviral-chewing-gum-reduce-influenza-and-herpes-simplex-virus-transmission" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to Penn News.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniell and his colleagues are now looking to use lablab bean powder to tackle bird flu, which is currently having a significant impact in North America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, bean powder was shown by others to effectively neutralize H5N1 and H7N9—two strains of influenza A known to cause bird flu in humans as well as in birds. Daniell and colleagues are currently looking to test its use in bird feed to help control bird flu in birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the researchers prepared the gum as a clinical-grade drug to comply with the FDA specifications for drug products and found the gum to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Controlling transmission of viruses continues to be major global challenge. A broad spectrum antiviral protein (FRIL) present in a natural food product (bean powder) to neutralize not only human flu viruses but also avian (bird) flu is a timely innovation to prevent their infection and transmission,” says Daniell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.30.25321421v3"&gt;large-scale study&lt;/a&gt; conducted by the Cleveland Clinic on the effectiveness of the 2024–2025 influenza vaccine shows that those who took the shot had a 27 percent higher risk of infection compared to those who skipped the jab.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Contrary to public health assurances — not to mention the advice of doctors and TV ads by large pharmaceutical companies — the findings suggest the vaccine may not only lack effectiveness but could actually increase the risk of influenza infection.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research, led by Dr. Nabin Shrestha, analyzed data from more than 53,000 employees in Cleveland Clinic’s Ohio facilities during the 2024–2025 respiratory viral season. The goal was to evaluate the vaccine’s real-world performance in protecting against laboratory-confirmed influenza. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants included relatively healthy, working-age adults, offering a focused lens on vaccine impact in a healthcare setting. Of the employees analyzed, 82.1 percent received the influenza vaccine. However, the study found that the cumulative incidence of influenza infections was higher in vaccinated individuals compared to those unvaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the 25-week study period, 1,079 confirmed cases of influenza — primarily caused by influenza A — were recorded. In the study’s medical language, the researchers wrote: “In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95 percent C.I., 1.07 – 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of −26.9 percent (95 percent C.I., −55.0 to −6.6 percent).”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means vaccinated individuals had a 27 percent higher risk of infection compared to unvaccinated employees. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shrestha and his team emphasized that these findings could not be dismissed as a statistical anomaly. The analysis, enriched through time-dependent methods and adjusted models, consistently showed this troubling pattern. “No protective effect emerged at any point,” the &lt;a href="https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/landmark-cleveland-clinic-study-finds-flu-vaccine-ineffectiveand-possibly-harmfulfor-working-adults-in-2024-2025-season-84b3b608"&gt;researchers noted&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study raises critical questions about this year’s flu vaccine formulation, including the possibility of “strain mismatches” and immune interference. It also challenges broader public health messaging about the benefits of the annual flu vaccine, particularly in years of poor strain selection.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The negative vaccine effectiveness figure — suggesting harm rather than protection — contradicts public health messaging and raises serious questions about strain mismatch, immune interference, or potential vaccine-related susceptibility,” the &lt;a href="https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/landmark-cleveland-clinic-study-finds-flu-vaccine-ineffectiveand-possibly-harmfulfor-working-adults-in-2024-2025-season-84b3b608"&gt;researchers said&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the study does have limitations, the researchers noted. It focused exclusively on the inactivated trivalent flu vaccine, which accounted for 99 percent of the vaccinations among participants. The effectiveness of alternative options such as quadrivalent or live-attenuated vaccines was not analyzed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, flu-related hospitalizations or deaths were too infrequent to assess, and the study could not capture cases diagnosed outside the Cleveland Clinic system.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, Dr. Shrestha said, “The data were robust enough to reject the common defense that odds ratios from ‘test-negative’ studies exaggerate protection—because here, direct risk was measured.”  &lt;/p&gt;

Older women are more prone to bone loss due to drops in estrogen during menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 10 million Americans with osteoporosis — a “silent” disease that weakens bones and rarely causes symptoms — &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/womens-health-topics/osteoporosis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:more than 80% are women;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;more than 80% are women&lt;/a&gt;, a quarter of whom are aged 65 or older, according to the Food and Drug Administration's Office of Women’s Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle changes, however, could offset those negative effects by preventing muscle loss, which plays a major role in overall bone strength, said Jesús García Gavilán, co-first author of the study and biostatistician at the University of Rovira I Virgili in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published in the journal JAMA Network Open, builds on a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2810826" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2023 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; that found a similar low-calorie diet and exercise regime lowered total body and visceral fat (fat that surrounds organs) in the same study group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new research, 924 Spanish adults ages 55–75 who are overweight or have obesity, and have metabolic syndrome — a cluster of conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high blood sugar — were separated into two groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One group followed a Mediterranean diet with a 30% calorie reduction and gradually increased their physical activity to meet international recommendations for their age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exercise routine consisted of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;45-minute walks, six days a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strength, flexibility and balance exercises three days per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;30- to 40-minute resistance training sessions two days per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;People in the control group followed a Mediterranean diet with no restrictions or exercise recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/nutrition-basics/mediterranean-diet" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mediterranean diet &lt;/a&gt;consists mostly of plant-based foods, fish and healthy fats like olive oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant had their own daily calorie intake based on their weight, height and sex, Gavilan said. They reduced their calories by cutting down on meats and sausages, sugars, white bread, packaged fruit juices and sugary drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All participants received special X-rays that measured their bone mineral density in their femur and lumbar spine at the start of the study and then a follow-up after three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, bone density improved the most in the lumbar spine among those in the lower-calorie diet and exercise group, Gavilán said. Women received the most benefits with a 1.8% improvement in lumbar spine bone density.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dolores Shoback, an endocrinologist with UCSF Health who was not involved in the study, called this a “very modest effect” compared to improvements you see with drugs used to treat osteoporosis. Studies have found&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1521690X22000100#sec2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:increases in bone density in the lumbar spine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; increases in bone density in the lumbar spine&lt;/a&gt; anywhere from 3–13% after a year of treatment with these medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said this is likely because the study participants didn’t have a lot of bone loss from the start, and they also didn’t lose that much weight. People in the intervention group lost 3% of their total body weight over three years, which equals to about three pounds on average, Gavilán said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, experts say the study sheds light on the crucial roles diet and exercise play in mitigating the effects that rapid weight loss has on bone health— a phenomenon more people are experiencing with the use of weight loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How weight loss affects bone health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk of bone loss increases when a person drops a lot of weight in a short period of time, said Dr. Kristi Tough DeSapri, an internal medicine physician and osteoporosis expert with the Bone Health &amp;amp; Osteoporosis Foundation. Quick weight loss means there's less resistance on the bone as someone loses muscle along with fat, said DeSapri, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk for bone loss depends on many factors, such as age, body weight, physical activity levels and diet. Hormonal changes associated with weight loss, as well as a lack of calcium and vitamin D in calorie-restricted diets, can also contribute to bone loss, research shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 10% weight loss can result in a 1% to 2% bone loss in different areas of the body, research indicates. The bone loss numbers may double or triple in people who undergo bariatric surgery or use weight loss drugs such as semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy, DeSapri said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published last year found that people who used&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2820308" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GLP-1 medications without exercising;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; GLP-1 medications without exercising&lt;/a&gt; experienced a significant decrease in bone density in their hip and spine; when exercise was added to the mix, bone mass was protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shoback said the exercise regime in the new study may “be a big commitment every day” for older adults to realistically follow, but it could be valuable for younger adults who are at high risk for metabolic syndrome and may experience rapid weight loss with medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study was conducted in Spain, experts say the diet and exercise plan could benefit adults in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, there’s a big push now for protein and supplements, DeSapri said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But when we’re talking about obesity, metabolic syndrome and weight loss, the Mediterranean diet has already been validated as a lifestyle that can make a difference,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent group of experts who recommend health screenings, says that &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/osteoporosis-screening-guidelines-updated-bone-scan-rcna186871" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:women 65 years and older should receive a bone density scan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;women 65 years and older should receive a bone density scan&lt;/a&gt; for osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osteoporosis risk can be lowered by staying physically active, not smoking, limiting alcohol use and getting enough vitamin D and calcium in the diet via milk and salmon, or supplements, Shoback said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormone therapy is another effective way to reduce bone loss after menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lifestyle combined with a heart healthy diet — if people can do that, that’s going to help them a lot for so many of the complications that come your way as we age,” Shoback said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 18:08:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPQUpnV3ZVYndWRW5VZE1aTjdpbHVGZFl6RG02cE5VUHVwQUs0SmlCaWYyQjI2ZlFOb3hrUUc5VlFYRnV0MDVGMmRucnBNY3c1emFjSGFxM3BuLUdHSTJxYnJqZEFTbHRUdkNWd21FU1ZETElQVll6OUkxT0VyWXY1Vw</guid></item><item><title>My Boyfriend’s Strict Routines Rule Our Life Together.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm98oz1qj001h3b73oa6gycdr@published"&gt;I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost three years. We have an age difference (he’s 46, I’m 30). I love him dearly. He has OCD and is very big on his routines. Everything has a routine. He does not handle variation from the regular daily schedule very well. In all other aspects of our life, I’m totally fine with conforming to his needs—they benefit me 90 percent of the time anyway.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="36" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm98qp6gq00063b73xc2buf9f@published"&gt;But I think our sex life is just OK. It’s not bad, but it’s the same every time. It’s the same dirty talk, same actions, same outcome. I like it, but I really crave more variety.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm98oz1uo001j3b73nd6n245n@published"&gt;I don’t know how to bring this up to him, but I also don’t want to spend the rest of my life having the same exact sexual experience every time. I don’t want him to feel like I don’t understand or appreciate his OCD, but I’m not entirely sure if my problem stems from his need to follow routines or if it’s simply just how he likes to have sex.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm98oz20b001m3b730nxjsltw@published"&gt;Spend some time considering what you’ll do if it turns out that your boyfriend is only ever going to give you the same routine. Is this a dealbreaker for you? Or do you value the rest of the relationship highly enough that the repetitive nature of your sex is, while undesirable, something you can tolerate? This might come up when the two of you start discussing the subject, so it’s best to do the introspection now.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="174" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm98oz220001n3b73qzsw64ze@published"&gt;It’s also worth considering whether your stance differs depending on whether this is a personal preference of his or a manifestation of the OCD he experiences, since the end of your letter indicates this might be the case. Think about whether the reason changes anything, and, if so, why that is. Because the “why” seems to hold weight for you, I’d broach the subject of variety in sex with a question: ”I’ve been wondering about the way we have sex. Is the consistent routine a preference of yours or does it have something to do with the way OCD affects you?” As always, choose your time well, and make sure you have the emotional reserves to deal with any hard feelings that come up for either of you. Once you’ve asked your question, listen to what he says. Take into account the fact that sometimes many of us struggle to really know the answer to something like this at first, so be patient if he’s contradictory or needs to revisit the subject later on.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm98oz23g001o3b73if4xonsi@published"&gt;While you’re working through that big discussion, I’m wondering whether you can meet your desire for variety through masturbation. When you’re alone, you can absolutely change things up through different ways of stimulating yourself, fantasies, and any other variable you can think of. This might provide a way to let some steam off while the two of you work on variety when you’re together, or as an outlet long-term if he’s unable or unwilling to experiment and you decide you want to stay in the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="149" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm98ozeaa00283b73bzvyz48o@published"&gt;I’ve always been a free-spirited guy, and I don’t really know how I ended up married, especially to a prudish woman. Our sex life reduced a lot in the past few years, until I felt like my wife was just giving me boring maintenance sex three times a week and always claiming she was too tired or didn’t have the energy for anything kinkier or more exciting. We have three toddlers, so I didn’t want to mess up our family, and I decided to quietly take matters into my own hands. This fall, I discreetly started seeing a female friend a few nights a week. She knew I was involved in a marriage that didn’t sexually fulfill me, and I was able to enjoy sex with a true spark; plus, getting my needs met helped me become a better and more patient husband. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/05/girlfriend-told-wife-about-affair-advice.html"&gt;Unfortunately, my girlfriend told my wife.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;A neurologist said his &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/7-longevity-boosting-foods-blue-zones-add-to-shopping-list-2023-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;grocery shopping list&lt;/a&gt; is packed with affordable foods that can help protect your brain as you age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating foods rich in nutrients like healthy fats can help boost your focus and mental function, and &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mediterranean-mind-diet-linked-to-lower-alzheimers-risk-brain-study-2023-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;reduce the risk of Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; and stroke in the long-term, according to Dr. Aaron Lord, chief of neurology at NYU Langone Hospital Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The brain is incredibly metabolically active. It takes about 25% of blood flow, so it's not a surprise that unhealthy eating can impact the brain," Lord told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said making better choices in the grocery store can also help you &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/no-sugar-added-food-swap-diet-reduce-intake-2023-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;cut back on sugar&lt;/a&gt; and processed foods, both of which can mess with blood sugar and metabolic, which in turn can affect the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In general, there's not going to be some supplement or vitamin or superfood that's going to be a cure-all," Lord said. "It's going to be about everyday choices, eating food that doesn't come out of a package."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord talked BI through his fridge, pantry, and typical grocery list for better brain health, and some of his favorite recipe ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="2b591363-53e7-4f2d-af85-e30a9c13e677" data-toc-id="2b591363-53e7-4f2d-af85-e30a9c13e677"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Fruit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord said more than two-thirds of his grocery list focuses on the first section of the grocery store, starting with fresh fruit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berries in particular are rich in antioxidants, making them a staple on the &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mind-diet-longevity-brain-health-ways-to-follow-2024-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;MIND diet&lt;/a&gt; for a healthy brain.

Herbs and spices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="1b605fae-f219-4e5f-af9d-910d88f7a02d"&gt;Seasonings aren't just a source of flavor, but can add to the nutrient content of your meals, according to Lord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="1b605fae-f219-4e5f-af9d-910d88f7a02d"&gt;One of his favorites is &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/turmeric-benefits" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;turmeric&lt;/a&gt;, an earthy, bright orange spice which can help reduce inflammation and may even stave off illnesses like Alzheimer's according to promising research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="1b605fae-f219-4e5f-af9d-910d88f7a02d"&gt;Another is black pepper, a versatile spice that helps to enhance the health benefits of turmeric by making the active ingredient easier for the body to absorb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="1b605fae-f219-4e5f-af9d-910d88f7a02d"&gt;Lord said he also frequently cooks with &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/parsley-major-part-staple-eat-follow-mediterranean-diet-2024-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;fresh parsley&lt;/a&gt;, which contains antioxidants and can provide a boost to recipes like soups and sauces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="628af731-73b6-4238-8bbb-1dddee5b9407" data-toc-id="628af731-73b6-4238-8bbb-1dddee5b9407"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Olive oil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="1b605fae-f219-4e5f-af9d-910d88f7a02d"&gt;One of the few packaged ingredients Lord buys regularly is olive oil, since it offers a dose of &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/olive-oil-benefits" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;healthy fats&lt;/a&gt; and has many uses in the kitchen, from sautéing to making sauces or salad dressings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You want to be using something that has as much unsaturated fats as possible," Lord said. "Olive oil is fantastic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="1b605fae-f219-4e5f-af9d-910d88f7a02d"&gt;What's good for your brain is also good for the rest of your body —research has linked olive oil to &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/olive-oil-benefits-brain-health-lower-dementia-death-risk-study-2023-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;lower risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt; and cancer as well as better heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a10e50b6-01ba-45fa-aedf-cde6f0439673" data-toc-id="a10e50b6-01ba-45fa-aedf-cde6f0439673"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Nuts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="a10e50b6-01ba-45fa-aedf-cde6f0439673"&gt;Lord said he keeps a supply of &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nuts-healthy-for-liver-and-gut-despite-high-calories-expert-2021-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;walnuts, pistachios, and almonds&lt;/a&gt; to snack on between meals. They're a great source of healthy fats like &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/taking-omega-3-supplements-may-slow-down-aging-study-2025-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, which protect brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="a10e50b6-01ba-45fa-aedf-cde6f0439673"&gt;Choosing healthy meals and snacks throughout the day may even prevent brain fog and boost focus in the short-term, &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8621754" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="a10e50b6-01ba-45fa-aedf-cde6f0439673"&gt;"When you're eating unhealthily, it can affect your function, performance right now on cognitive tests," Lord said. "It's not just a 20 years down the road thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="c3cec829-2956-4bb3-af63-62095afabf78" data-toc-id="c3cec829-2956-4bb3-af63-62095afabf78"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Coffee and tea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your morning brew could be a big boost to your brain health, according to Lord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee is a good source of &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/drinking-coffee-daily-may-stave-off-early-death-study-suggests-2022-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;anti-inflammatory compounds&lt;/a&gt; that help protect the brain. However, it may be better to opt for &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-the-best-way-to-make-coffee-2020-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;filtered coffee instead of French press&lt;/a&gt; to remove oils that can raise your cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tea is also a good choice since it's rich in &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tea-hot-cocoa-good-for-your-brain-according-to-science-2020-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;flavanols&lt;/a&gt;, another compound linked to better brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to avoid sugary beverages like sweetened coffees, Lord said. Instead of sodas, switch to seltzers and experiment with different flavors like fruit or non-alcoholic bitters to keep it fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="3a765b5e-f2f2-41f0-a125-9152b07c70aa" data-toc-id="3a765b5e-f2f2-41f0-a125-9152b07c70aa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Homemade popcorn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="3a765b5e-f2f2-41f0-a125-9152b07c70aa"&gt;Instead of reaching for a bag of chips when you want a salty snack, Lord recommends making popcorn at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="3a765b5e-f2f2-41f0-a125-9152b07c70aa"&gt;Homemade popcorn is a cheap, &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/healthy-snacks-dietitian-eats-instead-of-ultra-processed-foods-2024-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;healthy alternative to processed food&lt;/a&gt;. Lord makes his with a drizzle of olive oil, a little salt, and &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/nutritional-yeast" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;nutritional yeast&lt;/a&gt;, which adds a savory flavor along with B vitamins and protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="3a765b5e-f2f2-41f0-a125-9152b07c70aa"&gt;Small changes to your diet like this can help you cut back on processed foods and reduce your risk of common illnesses that can affect your brain as well as your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="3a765b5e-f2f2-41f0-a125-9152b07c70aa"&gt;"All the foods that we eat in a modern American diet that lead to metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes are going to impact the brain," Lord said. "How you get your calories really matters."&lt;/p&gt;

Behind those statistics is a heartbreaking condition for individuals (and their loved ones) as they become confused and disoriented, struggle to recognise family, friends and caregivers, and lose the ability to live independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Recent studies from &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41582-021-00565-x" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;across the world&lt;/a&gt; have highlighted that dementia cases are likely to rise dramatically. For instance, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03457-x" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;an analysis&lt;/a&gt; of 15,000 middle-aged US adults in Nature Medicine in January 2025 found that in study participants, the lifetime risk of developing dementia after 55 was 42%. Basically, an estimated 42% of over 55-year-old Americans will eventually develop dementia. This is considerably higher than previous studies had found. The authors say that the number of US adults who will develop dementia annually is expected to double over the next four decades. The numbers are eye-wateringly high, and they align with a growing concern in public health that with more people living longer and elderly people becoming a larger proportion of the population, cases will increase dramatically, with associated health and social care challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible"

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;However, these estimates of a future tsunami of dementia are now &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/22/health/dementia-rates-elderly.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;being challenged&lt;/a&gt;, given &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40072416" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;data showing&lt;/a&gt; that age-specific dementia rates declined by about two-thirds among US adults between 1984 and 2024. Similar falling rates were found in Sweden, the Netherlands, the UK and France. To take it out of jargon, yes, the absolute number of people developing dementia is going up because of ageing and the increasing number of elderly people. Yet, at each age – whether it’s 50 or 60, or 70 – it seems that most studies show that the rate of developing dementia at a given age is going down, compared with what we’ve seen in the past. We’re getting better at living longer, with cognitive impairment still occurring but at a later age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There’s no simple answer to explain the decrease in age-specific dementia rates, although there are several hypotheses, such as lower smoking rates, higher education, better treatment of high blood pressure and early detection of cognitive impairment. We know that there are modifiable factors – that is, things that individuals and communities can do to prevent the onset of dementia. The Lancet Commission on dementia prevention &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/abstract" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that about 45% cases of dementia are preventable if 14 modifiable risk factors are addressed. These include education, hypertension, hearing loss, vision loss, smoking, obesity, depression, physical inactivity, diabetes, high LDL cholesterol, excessive alcohol consumption, air pollution and loneliness and traumatic brain injury. The causes of dementia are complex, and include genetic predisposition, but there are also significant actions that we can each do to improve the health of our brain and delay the onset of disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="968d272b-525e-4587-b550-9335a592063c" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":5,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"New blood test checks for Alzheimer’s and assesses progression, study says","elementId":"968d272b-525e-4587-b550-9335a592063c","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/31/new-blood-test-checks-alzheimers-assesses-progression"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":8,"display":2,"theme":1}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Over the past couple of decades we’ve become better at understanding these risk factors and developing public health policies and education to address them. We’ve also seen massive scientific progress in medical drugs. For instance, the past couple years have seen the development of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/18/alzheimers-drugs-hope-dementia-cost-side-effects" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;two new treatments&lt;/a&gt; for Alzheimer’s (donanemab and lecanemab), which clinical trials indicate slow down the progression of the disease – and which have led to bold claims, by pharmaceutical companies such as Lilley, that this is the “beginning of the end” of Alzheimer’s. Caution is needed, given the high cost of treatment and serious side-effects that these medicines can cause, but it still shows the slow and steady forward movement in dealing with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The decrease in age-specific dementia rates &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/25/cancer-striking-earlier-ultra-processed-foods" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;contrasts with cancer&lt;/a&gt;, where incidence is expected to keep going up in young people. Referred to as the “birth cohort effect”, the numbers show that each group of people born at a later time have a higher risk of developing cancer later in life. So someone born in 1990 is at a higher risk of developing cancer younger than someone born in 1980, who has a higher risk than someone born in 1970. For instance, colorectal cancer increased by 70% among those aged 15-39 in G20 countries between 1990 and 2019. We’re doing better in some areas of health like delaying dementia and losing ground in others such as cancer prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Yes, we all have to die at some point, and something in our mind or body will eventually break down with time, but the public health goal is to push disease as far as possible into the future. We know that there are things we can do to delay dementia, and we are already seeing progress likely linked to public health policies and medical advances. Behind the headline news of a dementia tsunami, there’s some good news too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 16:48:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxNMnhqb3hldE1qcXVnTTNEdUFWNmJ2U2xpN0xjekRpZEFmWWExZGt2UnhlcjQzVElSN2NzZHBVekM3VGtxRnVhWmJwM1F6MjV5WXVRaVlkNGVXYTBFZncxTGVvLTlZWENlRzZvYUNSMVhVTElPUVFuMVA2bGNrREFhR0d4ZVhhNlI5c0hYdTNHbEpaUzZVTlUxZQ</guid></item><item><title>Ozempic and Similar Drugs Could Help Ward Off Dementia, Study Suggests - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxOYmdvSlZqdlk2LVNHRDhGeFNtQnNKbHhaU0I4cWtCT2w3UDQ1M3hJT3V3MUlqSV9KUFdyR0UtR3FaNnozSFZ6NnJCdUtMcXlEX0hTOFNPZlg5X0hheFN1c25pQVJOV3pZTkFlR3pxTVNwbEs5MFg0TldkclBNOHNtUEgwM2xFTERlQ0JqaTFybUpseFZfSWpFY1JCa0FURmlhOWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;The case for Ozempic as a dementia buster is building. Research published this week has found that GLP-1 drugs are associated with a lower risk of dementia in people with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers in Ireland led the study, a review of the existing evidence. Compared to controls (like other forms of medication or a placebo), people on GLP-1 therapy were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with dementia, the researchers found. Other scientists and pharmaceutical companies have already begun to test these drugs in clinical trials for dementia prevention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-ozempic-works-and-whats-still-a-mystery-2000499272"&gt;Ozempic, Wegovy, and similar drugs&lt;/a&gt; mimic the hormone GLP-1, which helps regulate our blood sugar and appetite (the drugs are made with the active ingredient semaglutide). These drugs were first approved to lower blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes, but are now commonly also used to treat obesity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People with poorly controlled diabetes are at higher risk for Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia, and recent clinical trials have additionally shown that GLP-1 therapy can &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-treatment-reduce-risk-serious-heart-problems-specifically-adults-obesity-or"&gt;reduce the odds&lt;/a&gt; of cardiovascular disease, another risk factor for dementia. But according to the researchers behind the new study, there has been a “lack of robust evidence” supporting the use of heart-protective, glucose-lowering drugs like GLP-1s to prevent dementia in people.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data from 23 randomized, placebo-controlled trials of GLP-1 drugs and other glucose-lowering medications like SGLT2is. These trials involved roughly 160,000 volunteers and explicitly tracked whether anyone developed dementia or cognitive impairment during the study period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team failed to find a link between the overall use of these drugs and a lower risk of dementia or cognitive impairment compared to controls. But when they looked at drug classes separately, they found that GLP-1 drugs did appear to stand out from the rest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In this meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials, glucose-lowering therapy with GLP1-RAs, but not SGLT2is or pioglitazone, was associated with a statistically significant reduction in dementia or cognitive impairment,” the researchers wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2831975"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Monday in JAMA Neurology.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The findings are not the first to suggest a potential dementia-buffering effect from GLP-1 therapy. A study &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.089799"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; earlier this January, for instance, found some evidence that liraglutide (an older GLP-1 drug) could reduce the rate of brain shrinkage in people with Alzheimer’s (Gizmodo &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/ozempics-older-sibling-might-slow-down-alzheimers-2000482645"&gt;covered&lt;/a&gt; the study last year when its preliminary results were first disclosed). Another review &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38746639/"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last year also concluded that GLP-1 drugs may have possible “metabolic and neuroprotective benefits” in people with Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not exactly clear how GLP-1s might protect the brains of people with early dementia or at higher risk for it, though some scientists have speculated that these drugs may reduce inflammation or improve how our brain cells communicate. It also remains to be seen how impactful this protective effect will really be, if it is genuine. But bolstered by the early data, Novo Nordisk, the makers of Ozempic and Wegovy, have &lt;a href="https://www.novonordisk.com/news-and-media/news-and-ir-materials/news-details.html?id=39097"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; two large-scale phase III trials testing semaglutide for people with early Alzheimer’s disease, which are expected to wrap up next year. So soon enough, we’ll hopefully have some concrete answers to these questions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;MADISON, Wis. -- Residents now have quick access to life-saving medications thanks to harm reduction vending machines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new effort by Dane County, SSM Health, UW Health, and UW-Madison aims to increase access to naloxone and other items that can help prevent or treat a potentially fatal overdose. this initiative involves the placement of harm reduction vending machines outside two hospitals in the community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dane County is committed to saving lives and addressing the opioid epidemic with compassion, urgency, and evidence-based solutions," said Dane County Executive Melissa Agard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The machines which offer supplies at no cost, are stocked with items that include doses of naloxone (nasal spray and injection), fentanyl test strips, xylazine test strips, menstrual kits, and other harm reduction materials. The vending machines are located outside of SSM Health St. Mary's Hospital at the corner of S. Park Street, and Erin Street., and the UW Health University Hospital emergency department at 600 Highland Ave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A review of overdose deaths in Dane County from 2020, led by Public Health Madison &amp;amp; Dane County, found that 45% of people who died from an overdose had an emergency department visit within the year before their fatal overdose. Of those visits, 24% were for a non-fatal overdose and 34% occurred within 30 days of their death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dane County Emergency Management analyzed data provided by similar vending machine programs, along with ambulance run reports to identify types of harm reduction materials that would benefit the community. The department also applied for a grant administered by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services using opioid settlement funds to support the purchase of the machines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The machines will be monitored and restocked by emergency management staff, in partnership with Public Health Madison &amp;amp; Dane County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;​COPYRIGHT 2025 BY CHANNEL 3000.

                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Cognitive shuffling, a technique developed by cognitive scientist Dr. Luc Beaudoin, helps quiet racing thoughts for better sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;The method involves mentally conjuring random, non-emotionally charged words and corresponding images for each letter.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Though research is limited, the technique mimics natural sleep onset when the brain experiences fragmented thought patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Practitioners typically report falling asleep within five to 15 minutes while using this mental distraction method.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Experts emphasize cognitive shuffling is not a replacement for proper sleep hygiene or treatment for sleep disorders.&lt;/li&gt;

            When Dr. Luc Beaudoin was an undergraduate student nearly 40 years ago, he often had &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/11/health/insomnia-what-to-do-wellness/index.html"&gt;trouble falling asleep&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday nights and was eager to find a solution.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms00083b6m2kte43w8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He found inspiration in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/27/health/cbt-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-wellness/index.html"&gt;a cognitive psychology&lt;/a&gt; class he was taking and &lt;a href="https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/22392" target="_blank"&gt;a professor’s theory&lt;/a&gt; regarding visual motion detection, Beaudoin, now a cognitive scientist, said. Visual motion detection refers to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the visual system’s ability to perceive and process motion based on changing patterns of light on the retina.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms00093b6mon5p9roq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I thought to myself: If I can understand the human brain’s ‘sleep onset control system,’ I could perhaps devise a technique to trick the brain into falling asleep,” Beaudoin, who is also an adjunct professor of education at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, said via email. That technique was cemented as “cognitive shuffling” by 2009, when he was 41 and experiencing another bout of difficulty initially falling asleep or falling back asleep after waking up in the middle of the night.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000a3b6mmknt2rf7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My insomnia went away,” Beaudoin said. “My girlfriend (now my wife) was amazed that I would fall asleep so quickly. I felt I was onto something important. So, I read more extensively and thought deeply about the sleep onset control system.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000b3b6myb7b1pij@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cognitive shuffling typically involves mentally conjuring up random, impersonal and non-emotionally charged words. For each letter of a word you pick at random, you think of as many corresponding words as you can for five to eight seconds each before moving to the next letter, Beaudoin said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000c3b6mfd6p68ue@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the word “piano,” for example, you might think “Pear, parachute, Paul, pirouette … Item, intention, immature, igloo …” and so on. (Beaudoin is also an owner of CogZest and a cofounder of CogSci Apps Corp. and Somnolence+ Inc., all of which develop products based on his research.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000e3b6mhs53ulhr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the technique may not sound calming, it “takes your mind off of your problems and your issues, and helps you get into a more relaxed state of mind,” said Dr. Fariha Abbasi-Feinberg, a sleep medicine physician and neurologist at the Millennium Physician Group in Fort Myers, Florida.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000f3b6mr3q3axxv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I always tell patients, ‘You cannot force yourself to sleep. You have to allow yourself to sleep.’ And this is just one of the methods that we use to help with that,” added Abbasi-Feinberg, who often suggests the technique for her patients having sleep issues.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000g3b6mouaa64p0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sometimes you can even visualize corresponding scenarios or movements, such as yourself playing the piano or someone falling with a parachute, Beaudoin said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Here’s the science behind cognitive shuffling, and what to know about practicing it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000i3b6mfck7ic3g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At this point, there’s little research on cognitive shuffling. So what makes some doctors back a do-it-yourself sleep hack without substantial evidence?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000j3b6m8qcbcksu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It turns out that the fundamental theory behind cognitive shuffling, though conjectural, “aligns with established principles in cognitive neuroscience and sleep psychology,” Dr. Leah Kaylor, a clinical psychologist and author based in Louisiana, said via email. It’s based on a large number of studies Beaudoin and other researchers reviewed in a paper published April 2020 in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079219302217" target="_blank"&gt;Sleep Medicine Reviews&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000l3b6mzxenhvrk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition to taking the mind off one’s worries, cognitive shuffling “resembles in critical respects natural sleep onset,” Beaudoin said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000m3b6m2cxw2cy4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the natural transition into sleep, people tend to have “microdreams” and fragmented, nonlinear thought patterns, Beaudoin and Kaylor said. Intentionally engaging in random, disconnected thinking may replicate this cognitive presleep state, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264574" target="_blank"&gt;helping people fall asleep&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000n3b6m8k774cjj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We think there’s a positive feedback loop in the brain: Microdreams are not just a product of falling asleep; they cue the brain that it is safe and appropriate to fall asleep,” Beaudoin said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000o3b6mp0pbg0ic@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since our brains tend to “shuffle” between random thoughts during quieter periods, giving our brains a calming or neutral distraction can be more helpful than allowing them to find something on their own, Dr. Kami McManus, a sleep psychologist in the department of sleep medicine at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia, said via email.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000p3b6m6ax26gf7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Beaudoin published &lt;a href="https://summit.sfu.ca/item/16196" target="_blank"&gt;his third study&lt;/a&gt; on cognitive shuffling in 2016. The study’s sample size was small, but its findings were encouraging: 154 college students, most of them female, were randomly assigned to a standard treatment done before bedtime, to practicing a cognitive shuffling exercise more formally known as a serial diverse imagining task (SDIT), or to both.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000q3b6mg4fdaep9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the SDIT group, an app randomly presented recordings of words one at a time with eight-second intervals in between, during which participants created and maintained an image of the word until the next recording prompted the next image and so on.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000r3b6mc9xzbwfe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The SDIT group were more likely to experience improvements in sleep quality, difficulty falling asleep and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2603482/" target="_blank"&gt;presleep arousal&lt;/a&gt; — heightened physical or mental activity while trying to fall asleep. These benefits lasted throughout the semester.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000s3b6mltuncbv7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Beaudoin and his team are planning additional research, this time comparing cognitive shuffling to other mental visualization and cognitive techniques.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000t3b6m0rrwa0ep@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To practice cognitive shuffling, there isn’t a set number of words or amount of time required. The words you choose for each letter also don’t have to be logically related, Kaylor said — trying to control the randomness will reduce the technique’s effectiveness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000u3b6m6evsxta5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People typically report falling asleep within around five to 15 minutes, while others may take longer, especially if they’re highly stressed or prone to overthinking, Kaylor said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000v3b6mt4knhseh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you find yourself engaged in the technique for more than 20 minutes or starting to feel frustrated, it’s best to give up and get out of bed, McManus said. Your body may not be ready, so doing a calming activity elsewhere for 20 to 30 minutes before going back to bed and trying again is better than trying too hard and activating negative emotions, making sleep more difficult.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000w3b6m9lgrqmal@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Try this technique several nights in a row before you decide whether cognitive shuffling works for you, these experts recommended. However, remember that it’s not a replacement for proper sleep hygiene or a cure for a sleep condition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000x3b6m7z7p91qj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If someone drinks a lot of coffee before bed, they shouldn’t expect cognitive techniques to help them fall asleep,” Beaudoin said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000y3b6mnkhwpayr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, you should still ensure you have regular sleep and wake times; a bedtime routine involving other &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/16/health/4-7-8-breathing-technique-relaxing-wellness/index.html"&gt;wind-down habits&lt;/a&gt; such as journaling or taking a warm shower; a quiet, dark and cool room; limited screen time before bed; and no alcohol in the few hours before sleep.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97gswms000z3b6m9k73vmny@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you regularly have problems sleeping, Beaudoin emphasized that cognitive techniques in general aren’t replacements for medical advice. They’re also not substitutes for cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, &lt;a href="https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-treatments/c/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-insomnia/procedures.html" target="_blank"&gt;known as CBT-I&lt;/a&gt;, as many cases of insomnia have more than one element in need of treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended her funeral on Sunday, calling it “a heartbreaking day” in &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1909049021211263268"&gt;a post on X&lt;/a&gt;. Kennedy has a long history of spreading misinformation about the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and has spent much of the current outbreak attempting to &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/rfk-downplays-texas-measles-outbreak-after-first-death.html"&gt;downplay the seriousness&lt;/a&gt; of the situation and promoting &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/health/measles-kennedy-vitamin-a.html"&gt;dangerous and unproven alternative treatments&lt;/a&gt;. But apparently, he found the weekend’s events sobering enough to share some evidence-based information about how to avoid preventable deaths of children. “The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine,” &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414"&gt;he wrote&lt;/a&gt; on X.&lt;/p&gt;

Following widespread criticism of his lackluster measles response, he published &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us"&gt;an op-ed&lt;/a&gt; with Fox News Digital, writing that “vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity.” In neither case has he explicitly urged parents to vaccinate their children — he called vaccination a “personal” decision in the Fox News piece — but plenty of his fans still weren’t thrilled. (Some did appreciate that he gave &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@annarmatson/video/7477609869424545067"&gt;airtime to vitamin A&lt;/a&gt;, which doctors have &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/health/measles-kennedy-vitamin-a.html"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; can be dangerous in large doses in addition to being ineffective at preventing measles.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm98n5xve00113b74sto01vm9@published" data-word-count="114"&gt;But it’s increasingly hard to deny that RFK Jr.’s public statements about vaccines have been wildly inconsistent. After spending years &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/us/rfk-jr-finances.html"&gt;profiting off lies about vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, he attempted to reassure Americans last fall that he wouldn’t “&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-win-rfk-jr-says-wont-take-away-anybodys-vaccines-rcna178955"&gt;take away anyone’s vaccines&lt;/a&gt;” and &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/rfk-jr-confirmation-hearings-vaccines-abortion-pills-gender-affirming-care.html"&gt;repeatedly claimed&lt;/a&gt; to be “pro-vaccine” during his confirmation hearings. Yet despite his claims to want transparency and “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/us/politics/rfk-jr-anti-vax.html"&gt;good science&lt;/a&gt;,” the FDA recently canceled &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/politics/fda-flu-vaccine.html"&gt;a flu-vaccine planning meeting&lt;/a&gt; of scientific experts without giving any indication why. Meanwhile, RFK Jr. has tapped David Geier — &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/health/rfk-jr-autism-vaccines.html"&gt;another notorious anti-vaxxer&lt;/a&gt; — to lead a study reexamining the already thoroughly debunked link between vaccines and autism, which even Republican senator Bill Cassidy has suggested is &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/nih-hearing-jay-bhattacharya.html"&gt;a waste of time and money&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

However, there still needs to be considerable focus on further research with larger trials to clarify its efficacy and safety in managing ASD.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the latest &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-4154a0c0-1480-11f0-bdec-49040de85ba9" class=""&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; data, one in 36 children in the US have autism - just under 2million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the early 2000s, this number was closer to one in 142. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though it's unclear what exactly could be behind the rise, experts have blamed environmental exposures like pollution, as well as doctors getting better at spotting the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive compound in marijuana, CBD does not cause a 'high' or sense of euphoria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CBD has been shown to improve conditions like epilepsy and other brain disorders, which experts suggest could be due to the same mechanism as treating autism.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the review abstract, presented this week at the 2025 European Congress of Psychiatry, researchers analyzed three studies involving 276 total children and young adults with autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants ranged from five to 21 years old, and the average age was 10. More than two-thirds of the participants were male.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patients received either a gradually increasing dose of CBD or a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The dosage started at one milligram per kilogram of body weight and gradually went up to 10 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CBD gummies sold in the US can contain anywhere from five to 120 milligrams per gummy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear if the CBD was the same type sold at health stores in the US or if it was a specific medical grade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found children and young adults taking CBD had 'significantly enhanced social responsiveness,' meaning they were better able to understand social cues and maintain conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants also had 'moderate' improvements in disruptive behaviors like tantrums and sleep and 'small yet notable reductions' in anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'These findings support the potential consideration of CBD cannabis extracts in ASD treatment plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, the review's limitations include a small number of studies, limited sample sizes, and significant heterogeneity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Future research with larger, robust trials is needed to clarify the efficacy and safety of CBD cannabis extracts in managing ASD.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows states that have medical cannabis programs in the US.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts believe CBD could lead to improvements in autistic behaviors by activating endocannabinoids, molecules that bind to cannabinoid receptors in the brain, spinal cord, gastrointestinal tract, and immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could influence functions like mood, anxiety, metabolism, sleep, and pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, a similar study in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/17/6/686"&gt;Pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt; found CBD improved communication skills, attention, learning, eye contact, irritability, and overall quality of life in autistic people ages five to 18 after six months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medical cannabis is legal in 47 states, the District of Columbia, and the US territories Guam, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While cannabis for medical use is legal in the UK with a prescription, it is a controlled substance and is illegal to possess, produce, supply, import, or export, according to the House of Commons Library.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only patients with Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and nausea from chemotherapy can &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-6249029/Medical-cannabis-available-prescription-month.html"&gt;get a prescription for medical cannabis through the NHS.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Geert Dom, president of the European Psychiatric Association, said: 'ASD can be extremely frustrating for all involved; parents of children and adolescents with the disorder, the treating clinicians and of course the children and adolescents themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A large part of this frustration is down to finding a viable treatment option that works to reduce symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is with delight that we see the results of this meta-analysis and we hope to see further research into this so we can move towards a solution to the unmet need within this community.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The link between cannabis and autism is complicated and still not well understood.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, some evidence suggests using cannabis during pregnancy may cause genetic changes in unborn babies, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13183003/using-weed-pregnancy-adhd-autism-rates-rising.html"&gt;increasing their risk of autism and ADHD&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, autism advocacy groups have said the causes of autism are not fully understood and many experts suggest there isn't one specific cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

during the week can still see benefits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/stay-fit-your-40s-beyond-smart-workout-tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;STAY FIT IN YOUR 40S AND BEYOND WITH THESE SMART WORKOUT TIPS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While exercising can have a positive impact on the body regardless of frequency, Hiestand cast doubts that weekend warriors see similar benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Based on my observations with my clients, I doubt weekend warriors see the same benefits in &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;, healthy body composition and athletic performance as those who are active throughout the week," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One fitness trainer recommends strength training three times a week and at least 30 minutes of walking per day.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While my recommendations vary depending on a person’s goals, for &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/wellness" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;general health&lt;/a&gt;, I typically recommend strength training three times a week. For cardio, I suggest a minimum of 30 minutes of walking daily (it doesn't necessarily need to be all at once)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people who seek change in body composition or athletic improvement, Hiestand recommended increasing the duration or intensity of the exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Something is better than nothing, and if you truly can't meet the movement recommendations from doctors or trainers, start with what you can do," she said.

If left undiagnosed or untreated, CKD can progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation to save the life of the patient.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="shortEntryContainer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Your kidneys could be dying in silence and you might not even know it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per statistics, 1 in 10 people suffer from some kind of chronic kidney disease globally. It can occur at any age and several risk factors can trigger it. In India, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease is 800 per 10 lakhs of people and the incidence of end-stage kidney disease is 200 per 10 lakhs and diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_630x354/HT/p2/2018/10/02/Pictures/doctor-supports-kidneys-healthy_aa4678fc-c5f8-11e8-978e-6307977af0b0.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Diabetes, hypertension, obesity, constant and recurrence urinary infections and other lifestyle disorders can lead to kidney related ailments.(HT/PHOTO)" title="Diabetes, hypertension, obesity, constant and recurrence urinary infections and other lifestyle disorders can lead to kidney related ailments.(HT/PHOTO)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Diabetes, hypertension, obesity, constant and recurrence urinary infections and other lifestyle disorders can lead to kidney related ailments.(HT/PHOTO)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rising prevalence of CKD can be encountered with increasing awareness and understanding of kidney health and disease. Further, early detection is considered a vital tool in the drive to prevent serious complications of CKD.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Chhya Vaja, Internal Medicine Expert at Apollo Spectra in Mumbai, shared, “Diabetes not only causes heart disease, nerve damage but even kidney problems. Diabetes is one of the leading causes of chronic kidney disease (CKD) causing a loss of kidney function. Over time, high blood sugar damages the small blood vessels in the kidneys, reducing their ability to filter waste.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Start these kidney-saving habits today&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk goes higher when diabetes is poorly managed. Dr Chhya Vaja explained that since CKD progresses silently without any symptoms in its early stages, many patients remain undiagnosed until severe kidney damage has occurred. Unmanaged blood sugar levels raise the risk of kidney disease.

Doing these tests once a year provides valuable information about kidney function and overall health.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He added, “Obesity in children can also lead to kidney disease in the future so, it is crucial to teach them the importance of weight control, healthy eating habits and regular exercise from an early age. Additionally, the unnecessary use of painkillers, self-medication and delayed treatment of autoimmune diseases can have adverse effects on kidney health.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

This is significant because the hippocampus is among the first regions affected by Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), a technique that measures tissue stiffness, scientists scanned the brains of young adults and found that only the hippocampus showed this link between blood flow and stiffness. These findings may help pave the way for earlier detection of Alzheimer’s disease by identifying brain changes before memory loss begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced Imaging:&lt;/strong&gt; MRE allows precise measurement of brain tissue stiffness and vascular influence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hippocampus Sensitivity:&lt;/strong&gt; Increased blood flow causes stiffness specifically in the hippocampus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagnostic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Brain stiffness may be an early marker of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Washington&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ME researchers have discovered that increased blood flow leads to stiffness in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that plays important roles in learning and memory. The hippocampus is one of the first areas in the brain affected by Alzheimer’s disease, a brain disorder that erodes memory and thinking skills, as well as the ability to do daily tasks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the first time, we found that better blood flow makes the hippocampus area stiffer,” says ME Associate Professor Mehmet Kurt, the director of Kurtlab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108483"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-flow-brain-stiffening-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Using factors like blood flow and stiffness components to quantify brain health could help lead to earlier detection of neurological diseases like Alzheimer’s, which currently has no cure. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research suggests that one of the factors impacting hippocampus health might be reduced blood flow. This discovery opens up new potential ways to diagnose Alzheimer’s before memory loss occurs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the UW Center for Human Neuroscience and at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, researchers scanned the brains of 17 volunteers between the ages of 22 and 35 using magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). MRE, which combines magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with sound waves, provides researchers with information to create detailed images of varying levels of stiffness in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to find out how blood flow could potentially affect brain stiffness through MRE,”  says ME Ph.D. student Caitlin Neher, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The hippocampus is only part of the brain that shows this relationship between blood flow and stiffness. This may be because the hippocampus is a region with strong metabolic demand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using factors like blood flow and stiffness components to quantify brain health could help lead to earlier detection of neurological diseases like Alzheimer’s, which currently has no cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies reveal that people with Alzheimer’s show softening in the hippocampus. One hypothesis is that in early Alzheimer’s, a reduction in blood flow could lead to this change in the brain, Neher says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study focused on the basic science question of how blood flow and brain stiffness are related,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It would be interesting to eventually apply this to a patient population by collaborating with UW Medicine. We want to better understand this link between brain stiffness and blood flow, and come up with diagnostic criteria.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.me.washington.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mehmet Kurt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.me.washington.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Washington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Mehmet Kurt – University of Washington&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsfs.2024.0051" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Perfusion–mechanics coupling of the hippocampus&lt;/a&gt;” by Mehmet Kurt et al. &lt;em&gt;Interface Focus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perfusion–mechanics coupling of the hippocampus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is a highly scrutinized brain structure due to its entanglement in multiple neuropathologies and vulnerability to metabolic insults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study aims to non-invasively assess the perfusion–mechanics relationship of the hippocampus in the healthy brain across magnetic resonance imaging sequences and magnetic field strengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, 17 subjects (aged 22–35, 7 males/10 females) were scanned with magnetic resonance elastography and arterial spin labelling acquisitions at 3T and 7T in a baseline physiological state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No significant differences in perfusion or stiffness were observed across magnetic field strengths or acquisitions. The hippocampus had the highest vascularity within the deep grey matter, followed closely by the caudate nucleus and putamen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discovered a positive perfusion–mechanics correlation in the hippocampus across both 3T and 7T groups, with a highly significant correlation overall (&lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; = 0.71, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0019), which was not observed in the caudate nucleus, a similarly vascular region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we supported our hypothesis that increased perfusion in the hippocampus would lead to greater pulsatile displacement in a small cohort (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that the hippocampus is an exceptionally vulnerable structure, with perfusion deficits often seen in diseases related to learning and memory, our results suggest a unique mechanistic link between metabolic health and stiffness biomarkers in this key region for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 14:59:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE9JTnVSLTQzY3h5MFZSZFN0YjJuREI3TDhLcnZyaVhoa0dSWkoxQTRBd09tMlMxcGNEWjFEbVdNOXg2dFN6YXU5WjI2X2VwMV8tZG9LNi1xYS1BeW80NzNsM3ROVDdkZXpQRm1FYmlUVQ</guid></item><item><title>I Was Caring For A Patient With Down Syndrome.

You were &lt;em&gt;so kind &lt;/em&gt;to that little boy!” a pediatric resident told me with a saccharine and insincere tone. I was a third-year medical student, and she’d pulled me aside after she’d witnessed me giggling and zipping trucks along bedrails with a patient. I was also a 25-year-old woman who lacked a professional filter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Why wouldn’t I be kind?” I blurted out. My voice mirrored my grandmother’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember if the child was experiencing a specific ailment commonly coupled with his Down syndrome, such as leukemia or a structural heart or digestive condition, or if he was hospitalized for a typical pediatric problem like asthma, appendicitis or some accidental injury. What I remember is the resident’s eyebrows arching and her lips pursing. I realized too late she’d expected me to just say “thank you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I trained my eyes on the tiny plastic frog dangling from her stethoscope. The amphibious toy meant to distract children while she auscultated their hearts and lungs couldn’t distract me from the sound of my pounding heart. We stood silently facing each other in the hospital corridor, until I heard the little boy’s Tonka truck clank to the floor. Saved by gravity, I pivoted back into his room to pick it up with echoes of my grandmother’s yelling buzzing in my ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty years earlier, my grandmother Yetta reprimanded me and my cousin for tumbling headfirst down the half-flight of carpeted stairs in her split-level house, wearing the smocked Polly Flinders dresses she’d bought us. It would take me another 20 years to understand that my grandmother’s reprimands captured her purest expression of acceptance toward my cousin Becky, who has Down syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My grandmother’s words bit the air: “Rachel, Rebecca, stop it!” She was a staunch woman with curly jet-black hair who audited taxes for the IRS while raising three boys and running a luncheonette with my grandfather. She had zero tolerance for nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sorry, Granny,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“OK, Ede,” Becky said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight of her grandchildren called her Granny, but not Becky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not Ede. Granny,” my grandmother would chide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always, my cousin smiled. “No. Ede.” Becky never explained why she used this name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And always, my grandmother smiled back. Their lighthearted refrain was a familiar script interjected between my grandmother’s complaints about the way my grandfather chewed everything he ate and how long it took him to do his daily crossword puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Rebecca Fleishman (left) and the author in Lake George, New York, in 1980. &lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Courtesy of Charles Fleishman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becky was a year older than me. We spent our elementary school days playing hide-and-seek with our brothers, middle school swimming in her parents’ backyard pool, and high school changing into team swimsuits in our school locker room. My grandparents eventually moved to Florida while Becky and I were still waving hello to each other across our school cafeteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Becky and I finished high school in the late ’90s, she moved to California with her mom and stepfather, and I moved to New York City for college and medical school. While I spent the bulk of my time in libraries, Becky completed vocational training and then worked at a bowling alley, and our grandmother discovered email. She sent Becky countless messages from her handle, GranEde, and Becky always replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t meant to be rude by rejecting the resident’s compliment, but my actions didn’t feel praiseworthy or even unusual. The world I knew before medical school was the one modeled by the adults who’d raised me. I’d always known that people with Down syndrome have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/birth-defects/about/down-syndrome.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:distinct physical features;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;distinct physical features &lt;/a&gt;— what the medical literature calls “stigmata” — and a propensity for certain health conditions and disabilities, but I had never witnessed how they can be &lt;a href="https://migrationletters.com/index.php/ml/article/view/9307/6054" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:subjected to;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;subjected to&lt;/a&gt; harassment, humiliation, mistreatment and neglect, both in hospitals and outside them. I’d come to learn that “stigma,” a concept put &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357279828_Ervin_Goffman's_perspectives_on_contemporary_social_realities/link/6214b09a08bee946f395e13a/download?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIiwicGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIn19" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:forth by Erving Goffman;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;forth by Erving Goffman&lt;/a&gt;, encompassed “disgrace attached to a particular condition or trait.” I’d never perceived Becky as stigmatized because our family did not isolate her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades after high school, Becky and I were mostly out of touch. I asked family members about her. I liked her Facebook posts. But my strongest connection to Becky was through my grandmother. When I flew to Florida for visits, my grandmother, in between digging through the sale rack at Bloomingdale’s and instructing the deli workers at Publix about the proper thickness of turkey breast slices, gave me the scoop on Becky. She told me about the races Becky swam in the Special Olympics and the volunteer work she did. And she told me, over and over, about the day she took Becky out for Chinese food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becky was in her late 20s at the time. My grandmother knew my cousin’s attitude about reading was inconsistent, but she refused to capitulate to Becky’s refusals. My grandmother handed her a menu. She waited. My cousin perused it and then announced to the waitress that she wanted “the happy family.” My grandmother, who once sat my father at the dinner table for hours because he refused to eat his peas, scoured the menu and discovered “the happy family” was a combination of several dishes, meant to serve six. She resigned herself to taking home leftovers because Becky had, after all, read the menu. Every time I heard this story, I believed my cousin picked “the happy family” not only because she wanted to eat what was in it, but because the words captured how she felt sitting in a sticky leather booth across from a woman who cherished her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Rebecca Fleishman (left) and the author at Becky’s bat mitzvah. &lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Courtesy of Sylvia Ginsberg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was early in my residency the first time I cared for a baby diagnosed with Down syndrome after birth. Becky was not on my mind as I sat, silent, beside my neonatologist mentor while she told a husband and wife that their 1-hour-old child might have this genetic condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prenatal testing, which from the narrow perspective of a pediatrician affords parents the benefit of emotional, intellectual and medical preparation before their babies are born, had not flagged the possibility. Two teaspoons of blood drawn after the 10th week of pregnancy, known as “noninvasive prenatal testing,” identifies more than 99% of fetuses with Down syndrome. But this test wasn’t available back then, when a combination of first and second trimester blood tests and ultrasounds (still sometimes done today) &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2020/0415/p481.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:identified many but not all;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;identified many but not all&lt;/a&gt; fetuses with Down syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becky was not on my mind as my mentor asked the baby’s name. I was transfixed by the way she spoke with purpose, and without judgment or pity — without implying Down syndrome was bad or tragic. She pointed out the physical features typical for Down syndrome and then asked the parents what they saw as we all peered at the baby’s face, hands and toes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families receive medical information differently. Some families readily believe the impressions of a physician, some want confirmatory genetic testing before accepting this diagnosis, while still others need time to process before engaging in further dialogue with doctors. My mentor’s goal was to inform the family of the possibility that the child had Down syndrome, not to convince them she was right. The only urgency she had was to build trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation had been so honest, so compassionate, so pure, that I left the room enchanted with the spell of human connection. I’d never considered that, as a doctor, I could learn to cast sacred spells with words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so I became a neonatologist — in part because of that mentor and the glittering moment of truth she’d conveyed with raw kindness, and in part so I could chase the same sparkling connections with families navigating the delight of babies’ births while accepting their concomitant medical diagnoses. Most of my patients are either born prematurely or born on time but unexpectedly sick. Almost every day, I reassure families that neonatal intensive care is likely to allow their children to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1866, Dr. John Langdon Down published a medical paper whose now-offensive title, “&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7707939/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Observations on the Ethnic Classification of Idiots;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Observations on the Ethnic Classification of Idiots&lt;/a&gt;,” obscures the importance of describing, and thereby lending medical legitimacy and attention to, human beings with Down syndrome. In 1959, not quite 20 years before Becky’s birth, the discovery that Down syndrome was caused by an extra 21st chromosome established the first link between an intellectual disability and genetics and paved the way for prenatal diagnostics. Since the 1970s, Down syndrome is &lt;a href="https://docs.downsyndromepopulation.org/factsheets/down-syndrome-population-usa-factsheet.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:increasingly prevalent;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;increasingly prevalent&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, while rates have simultaneously declined in &lt;a href="https://docs.downsyndromepopulation.org/factsheets/down-syndrome-population-europe-factsheet.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Europe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnosing Down syndrome and counseling families remains a tiny part of my job. I’ve rolled stools beside new mothers during repeat C-sections to share what seemed possible. I’ve sat beside families that other doctors didn’t quite know how to approach and disclosed the truth myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each time I have these high-stakes conversations, I roll my shoulders back, feel my sternum rise with my inhalations as I beckon reverence into these hospital rooms. I watch parental eyebrows and pupils and fingers clenching or unclenching as I utter measured words and allow conversations to bloom with unbridled parental emotion and exploratory questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a long time, I refrained from sharing stories about my cousin because Becky is only one person with a common condition that affects &lt;a href="https://www.globaldownsyndrome.org/about-down-syndrome/facts-about-down-syndrome/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:6 million people;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;6 million people&lt;/a&gt; differently. I didn’t want to inject her life story into these families’ stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Bernard Fleishman (Becky's grandpa, left), Becky Fleishman, and Yetta Fleishman (Becky's grandma) at Becky’s bat mitzvah &lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Courtesy of Sylvia Ginsberg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was several years into my career as a neonatologist when my grandmother died and I lost my connection to Becky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becky wasn’t at the funeral. No one quite knew how to tell her what had happened, and taking Becky across the country while everyone was grieving wasn’t feasible. My extended family shared stories of my grandmother. When it was my turn at the podium in that South Florida funeral home, I rambled, crying because I loved her for her freely expressed opinions. I mumbled about seagulls and almost sat down to sob into my husband’s blazer, when, from the depth of my grief, I shared an unscripted sentiment that sounds obvious only in hindsight: “How Granny treated Becky had a profound impact on me as a pediatrician.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I flew home to Philadelphia at peace with my grief-stricken insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never thought to call Becky or ask how she’d taken the news about Ede. I mailed holiday cards from Philadelphia to San Diego every December. Some years, she mailed back photos of herself making scratch pizzas and pastries. When I saw Facebook photos of her 40th birthday at Disneyland, I was ecstatic. Mostly, though, Becky and I remained out of touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then, three years after my grandmother died, I reconnected with Becky’s mom. Because of divorce and distance, I hadn’t spoken to my Aunt Sylvia since I was a teenager. I was struck, as I listened to her stories about Becky, by how much I missed my cousin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To this day, Becky will tell you she doesn’t have Down syndrome,” my aunt told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This didn’t surprise me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s because she was raised to believe she can do anything she wants,” I replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The diagnosis was a surprise,” my aunt explained. “The doctors told me lots of stuff that was just wrong.” They didn’t think Becky would breastfeed. They said she wouldn’t lift her head for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was appalled. I’ve cared for babies with Down syndrome with these challenges. But I’ve also cared for babies who did not have them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After Becky was born, one of the doctors told us she belonged in an institution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wait, what?!” I hadn’t known that. As a pediatrician, I couldn’t fathom advising parents to give away a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The little I knew about institutions for disabled people I’d learned from watching Geraldo Rivera’s documentary “&lt;a href="https://abc7ny.com/willowbrook-geraldo-rivera-staten-island-bill-ritter/11575075/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Willowbrook: The Last Disgrace;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Willowbrook: The Last Disgrace&lt;/a&gt;,” which came about after a doctor was fired from the &lt;a href="https://disabilityjustice.org/the-closing-of-willowbrook/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Willowbrook Developmental Center;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Willowbrook Developmental Center&lt;/a&gt; because he tried to champion humane care for the 5,230 people who lived there in the early ’70s. The &lt;a href="https://disabilityjustice.org/reform-and-closing-of-institutions/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:movement to close these institutions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;movement to close these institutions&lt;/a&gt; was underway when Becky was born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, what happened?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I called a pediatrician I already knew,” my aunt said — one who’d cared for Becky’s older brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was excited, mistakenly believing a pediatrician would be the hero in Becky’s story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pediatrician told her that children with Down syndrome did not thrive in institutions. If Becky didn’t come home, he suggested adoption as an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But your grandmother wouldn’t hear of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt my eyes wrinkle and a flash of warmth. “What did she do?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She marched into my hospital room,” my aunt recounted. “She said, ‘You’d bring a puppy home to be taken care of — she’s your daughter. You are bringing her home!’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was my grandmother. A firebrand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My aunt gave me a gift that day. I hadn’t known I’d spent my career manifesting words uttered a year before I was born. I flashed back to countless babies’ bedsides, to families who held their children, desperate for them to get better, survive, go home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever it took, whatever their children needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What those families craved, all of them, was hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The author (lower right) FaceTiming with Becky Fleishman (left) and her aunt Sylvia Ginsberg. &lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Courtesy of Sylvia Ginsberg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I began to think more about Becky when parents whose children had Down syndrome asked me about what the world might be like far into the future: “Will she learn to read?” “Will he ever join the football team?” “Will she get a job?” “Will he get married?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few months after I spoke to my aunt, I cared for a child with Down syndrome who required extra medical care after birth. I sat beside the baby’s crib, talking to his mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The space behind my sternum opened. I felt close to my grandmother, despite her death, and to Becky, who I never saw. My whole life, I never once heard my grandmother comment about the implications of disability. To label Becky as someone with disabilities felt like labeling the morning sky as a single color — an overly simplistic categorization of a nuanced person whose moods and gifts and antics shifted as quickly as the sun rises. She modeled acceptance through her actions — by treating Becky as, simply, herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That mother’s eyes met mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve never met someone with this,” she confided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Would you like to?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I told her about Becky, about all she’d accomplished, about how much she was loved. I pulled out my phone and showed her a photo of my cousin in aviator sunglasses and a leather jacket. Beaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mother clutched my phone, smiling, as her son opened his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;***&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I worked on this essay, I sent a draft to my aunt so she and Becky could weigh in. When my aunt first read it to Becky, Becky smiled the whole time. They were then gracious enough to FaceTime with me so I could ask Becky’s thoughts myself. As my aunt and I reminisced, Becky waved and smiled. Her expressive language is waning (perhaps related to early Alzheimer’s that afflicts some middle-age adults with Down syndrome), but she knew me and was excited to see me. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My aunt’s stories about times when people underestimated Becky’s ability to understand everyone around her reminded me that my cousin has always been a prankster. I asked Becky if she remembers the above stories. Hide-and-seek? High school hallways? So much swimming? Yes, she said to each memory I offered. Did she remember Ede? She offered a wide grin. I asked her if I could publish this piece about her. With a serious expression, she again said yes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Any one of us can only be who we are. Who we are, and who we become, is shaped by the people who raised us and the people we know, but also by the people we meet and the people we read about. In the 20 years since I graduated from medical school, the patients I’ve cared for, the families I’ve served, and the mentors who trained me all shaped how I understand this world. They’ve opened my eyes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But I would not have known how to look at this world, to truly see how people move through it, had it not been for how my grandmother treated my cousin. Looking back, their relationship is easily labeled: acceptance, kindness, unconditional love. But, as a child, these things were so ingrained, I never noticed them. My grandmother gifted me an irrefutable understanding that when I am able to love and accept people for exactly who they are, I am the doctor and person I aspire to be. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Note: Names and details of some individuals mentioned in this essay have been changed to protect their privacy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rachel Fleishman, M.D., is a neonatologist and writer based in Philadelphia.

&lt;p&gt;Scientists have uncovered a possible link between the placenta — the organ that provides oxygen and nutrients to a developing fetus — and the origins of mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If confirmed true, this finding could enhance scientists' understanding of how certain psychiatric disorders start to take root before birth, or are made more likely by events in the womb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the "&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/development-and-psychopathology/article/abs/neurodevelopmental-hypothesis-of-schizophrenia-following-a-trail-of-evidence-from-cradle-to-grave/DB470DDDB2A225948678AD048629F99B" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/development-and-psychopathology/article/abs/neurodevelopmental-hypothesis-of-schizophrenia-following-a-trail-of-evidence-from-cradle-to-grave/DB470DDDB2A225948678AD048629F99B" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;neurodevelopmental hypothesis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;," first proposed in 1987 by neuroscientist &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://neuroscience.jhu.edu/research/faculty/93" target="_blank" data-url="https://neuroscience.jhu.edu/research/faculty/93" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Daniel Weinberger&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, schizophrenia originates during fetal brain development. The theory suggests that a combination of genetic risk factors and prenatal conditions shape early brain wiring, thus increasing the likelihood of schizophrenia and other mental health disorders later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While widely accepted as feasible, the exact mechanism behind this hypothesis is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a recent study published March 14 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_8526823188123239845&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-025-57760-3&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fgenetics%2Forigins-of-schizophrenia-linked-to-epigenetics-of-the-placenta" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57760-3" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-025-57760-3&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fgenetics%2Forigins-of-schizophrenia-linked-to-epigenetics-of-the-placenta" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, reveals that part of the answer may lie in epigenetic modifications in the placenta. These are chemical changes to DNA molecules that don't alter the genes within them, but rather affect which genes are switched on or off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/ivf-may-raise-risk-of-certain-disorders-in-babies-and-epigenetic-signatures-in-the-placenta-could-explain-why" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/ivf-may-raise-risk-of-certain-disorders-in-babies-and-epigenetic-signatures-in-the-placenta-could-explain-why"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IVF may raise risk of certain disorders in babies — and epigenetic 'signatures' in the placenta could explain why&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, scientists analyzed DNA from 368 placenta samples, focusing on a type of epigenetic change called DNA methylation, which affects gene expression. They identified more than 214,000 stretches of DNA in the placenta where DNA methylation often takes place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-MELKfDFMCEZZ2ubAE9s3PZ" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-MELKfDFMCEZZ2ubAE9s3PZ slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these methylated DNA sites were located in areas where DNA is actively used to produce RNA and proteins; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-RNA.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-RNA.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;RNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a genetic cousin of DNA that helps shuttle blueprints out to protein construction sites in the cell. It's feasible, then, that DNA methylation can silence or activate genes involved in placental development and function, the team said. Changes in placental function are important because the placenta acts as an intermediate between the maternal environment and the fetus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past studies had already linked specific genes to psychiatric disorders, including &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/mind/ai-pinpoints-where-psychosis-originates-in-the-brain" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/mind/ai-pinpoints-where-psychosis-originates-in-the-brain"&gt;&lt;u&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/massive-study-of-3-million-people-reveals-genetic-hotspots-linked-to-bipolar-disorder" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/massive-study-of-3-million-people-reveals-genetic-hotspots-linked-to-bipolar-disorder"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34718-depression-treatment-psychotherapy-anti-depressants.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34718-depression-treatment-psychotherapy-anti-depressants.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;major depressive disorder&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. So the team compared their placenta DNA methylation data with existing data on these disorders, to see if the same genes cropped up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that several psychiatric disorder-related genes are highly methylated in the placenta. Therefore, they hypothesized that methylation can affect the activity of these placental genes — changing whether or not they make proteins — which in turn would affect fetal brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore these potential effects on the developing fetal brain, the researchers looked at how DNA methylation alters gene expression in the placenta. They found that many of the genes affected by DNA methylation are involved in immune responses. Based on these findings, they hypothesized that DNA methylation in the placenta influences the expression of immune-related genes, potentially raising the risk of infection in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949924024000132" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949924024000132" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Earlier studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have linked infections during pregnancy — including &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/flu" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/flu"&gt;&lt;u&gt;seasonal influenza&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Zika — to altered neurodevelopment of the fetus and a higher risk of psychiatric disorders in offspring. Researchers believe that infections during pregnancy can interfere with fetal brain development by triggering maternal immune responses that then cause fetal brain &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/52344-inflammation.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/52344-inflammation.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;inflammation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; or, alternatively, germs may directly infect fetal brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research hints at a possible throughline between the epigenetics of the placenta and these harmful immune responses. However, "the one problem is that this paper does not provide direct experimental evidence that specific methylation patterns lead to schizophrenia or other neuropsychiatric disorders," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://las.touro.edu/faculty/faculty-members/loike-john.php" target="_blank" data-url="https://las.touro.edu/faculty/faculty-members/loike-john.php" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;John Loike&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of biology and bioethics at Touro University in New York, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of pinpointing those exact mechanisms, this study looks at changes in the placenta's DNA as a kind of marker to explore how conditions during pregnancy might be linked to brain disorders later in life, said Loike, who was not involved in the study. "Further research is necessary to substantiate these findings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this epigenetic link is confirmed, the finding could theoretically point to ways of preventing psychiatric disorders, the authors suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we could identify risk factors at the prenatal stage, we could intervene before symptoms appear, adjusting treatments or designing personalized preventive strategies," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ariadna-Cilleros-Portet" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ariadna-Cilleros-Portet" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ariadna Cilleros-Portet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the first author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, said in a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ehu.eus/en/web/campusa-magazine/-/upv-ehu-part-of-genetic-risk-for-schizophrenia-acts-through-the-placenta" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ehu.eus/en/web/campusa-magazine/-/upv-ehu-part-of-genetic-risk-for-schizophrenia-acts-through-the-placenta" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-MELKfDFMCEZZ2ubAE9s3PZ-lImhrwCt5ME4QB4txTyPAQSrn6TH4Y0R" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-MELKfDFMCEZZ2ubAE9s3PZ-lImhrwCt5ME4QB4txTyPAQSrn6TH4Y0R slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Symptoms can take up to 21 days to appear, so any exposed person who isn’t vaccinated should avoid public gatherings for three weeks, according to the health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This case is a stark reminder that families traveling internationally should delay unnecessary travel or talk to their health care providers about early (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination for infants, especially when visiting areas with known measles outbreaks,” state epidemiologist Dr. Rachel Herlihy said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Denver case isn’t related to a &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/03/31/colorado-measles-pueblo-outbreak-public-health-mmr-vaccine/"&gt;case in Pueblo in an unvaccinated adult who also visited Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. That person visited Southwest Deli and Cafe in south Pueblo from March 17 to 21, as well as the Southern Colorado Clinic in Pueblo West and the South Side Walmart in Pueblo on March 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial symptoms include a fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes. The distinctive measles rash doesn’t appear until the person has already been contagious for about four days. People who could have been exposed and have symptoms should call their health care provider before coming in, so the provider can take precautions to avoid exposing others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine are 97% effective in preventing measles. People who survived it also generally have lifelong protection. Doctors don’t recommend trying to get measles, though, because of the risk of pneumonia, neurological damage and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/04/06/rfk-jr-visits-epicenter-of-texas-measles-outbreak-after-death-of-second-child-who-was-infected/"&gt;Two children&lt;/a&gt; and one adult have died this year in outbreaks in west Texas and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin A may be useful in treating children who have measles, but it doesn’t prevent infection. Parents shouldn’t give vitamin A without a doctor’s supervision, because giving too much can cause liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children can receive their first measles shot at about 1 year old and their second between 4 and 6.

			&lt;p&gt;Research in mice showed limited intakes of one particular essential amino acid can slow the impacts of aging and even lengthen their lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists now wonder if these findings could help people improve their longevity and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isoleucine is one of three branched-chain amino acids we use to build proteins in our bodies. It is essential for our survival, but since our cells can't produce it from scratch, we have to get it from sources like eggs, dairy, soy protein, and meats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TNHCTR9u4y4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there can always be too much of a good thing. &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(21)00166-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1550413121001662%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;Earlier research&lt;/a&gt; using data from a 2016-2017 survey of Wisconsin residents had found dietary isoleucine levels were linked with metabolic health and that people with higher BMIs were generally consuming much greater quantities of the amino acid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Different components of your diet have value and impact beyond their function as a calorie, and we've been digging in on one component that many people may be eating too much of," metabolism researcher Dudley Lamming from the University of Wisconsin, US, who was involved in both studies, &lt;a href="https://news.wisc.edu/mice-eating-less-of-specific-amino-acid-overrepresented-in-diet-of-obese-people-live-longer-healthier/"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; in 2023 when the newest findings were published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's interesting and encouraging to think a dietary change could still make such a big difference in lifespan and what we call 'healthspan,' even when it started closer to mid-life."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the most recent study, a genetically diverse group of mice was fed either a diet containing 20 common amino acids as a control, a diet where all amino acids were reduced by about two-thirds, or a diet where only isoleucine was reduced by the same amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mice were around six months old at the start of the study, which is the equivalent age of a 30-year-old person. They could eat as much as they wanted, but only from the specific kind of food provided to their group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_146146" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-146146" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/SoyFoods642.jpg" alt="Various soy foods" class="size-full wp-image-146146" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/SoyFoods642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/SoyFoods642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/SoyFoods642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-146146" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Our cells can't produce isoleucine from scratch – we have to get it from foods such as soy protein. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAFMZwKkZ1w/"&gt;ArtStudio Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restricting dietary isoleucine increased the lifespan and healthspan of the mice, reduced their frailty, and promoted leanness and glycemic control. Male mice had their lifespans increased 33 percent compared to those whose isoleucine was not restricted, and females had a 7 percent increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These mice also scored better in 26 measures of health, including muscle strength, endurance, blood sugar levels, tail use, and hair loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The male mice in this group had less age-related prostate enlargement, and were less likely to develop the cancerous tumors that are common in the diverse mice strains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, the mice given low isoleucine food also ate significantly more calories than the others. But rather than gaining weight, they actually burned more energy and maintained leaner body weights, even though their activity levels were no different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_112585" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-112585" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg.jpg" alt="Graphical abstract shows dietary isoleucine was restricted by 67%, charts showing blood glucose and body weight declining over time / age respectively, reduced frailty and cancer, increased lifespan (survival improved by 33 percent)" class="wp-image-112585 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg.jpg 996w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg-642x642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-112585" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A visual summary of the impact the reduced isoleucine diet had on mice in the study. (&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(23)00374-1"&gt;Green et al., C&lt;em&gt;ell Metabolism, &lt;/em&gt;2023)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers think restricting isoleucine in humans, either by diet or pharmaceutical means, has the potential to yield similar anti-aging effects - although, as with all mice studies, we won't know for sure until it's actually tested in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is easier said than done. Although the food provided to the mice was controlled, the researchers noted that diet is an incredibly complex chemical reaction, and there may be other dietary components involved in producing these results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restricting protein intake in general, for instance, has detrimental effects on the body, mouse or human. Translating this research for real-world human use is more complicated than just reducing intake of high-protein foods, even though this is the simplest way to limit isoleucine intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amino acid restriction level was constant in all experiments, and they acknowledge that more fine-tuning may be required for optimum effects across different mice strains and sexes – when it comes to diet, one size does not fit all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We can't just switch everyone to a low-isoleucine diet," Lamming &lt;a href="https://news.wisc.edu/mice-eating-less-of-specific-amino-acid-overrepresented-in-diet-of-obese-people-live-longer-healthier/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But narrowing these benefits down to a single amino acid gets us closer to understanding the biological processes and maybe potential interventions for humans, like an isoleucine-blocking drug."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(23)00374-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in November 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This conclusion comes from a natural experiment in Wales, where vaccine eligibility was determined by birthdate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used rigorous statistical methods, typically seen in economics, to isolate the effect of the shingles vaccine from other factors. Their findings suggest that routine immunization could play an unexpected role in protecting brain health as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20% Risk Reduction:&lt;/strong&gt; Shingles vaccination was linked to a 20% lower risk of dementia over seven years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Natural Experiment Design:&lt;/strong&gt; Eligibility for the vaccine was based on exact birthdate, allowing a unique causal analysis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Prevention Pathway:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings point to potential public health strategies for reducing dementia risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccination to prevent shingles also reduces the risk of developing dementia in later life, according to a research paper published recently in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This conclusion is based on the analysis of data collected in connection with the introduction of a shingles immunization program launched in Wales in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108467"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and a doctor with a syringe." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Because the individuals in the study cohort were only a few weeks apart in age, the researchers could assume that vaccination was the only factor that set the groups apart.

In the program, the eligibility to receive the vaccine was determined by an individual’s exact date of birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those born before 2 September 1933 were automatically ineligible for life, while those born on or after 2 September 1933 were entitled to receive the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can speak of a natural experiment in this context because this setting gives us the opportunity to compare individuals who had just turned 80 with those who had not quite reached 80 years of age,” Eyting explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the individuals in the study cohort were only a few weeks apart in age, the researchers could assume that vaccination was the only factor that set the groups apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We then looked at the risk of developing dementia over the next seven years,” Eyting continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the main goals of the analysis was to identify a potential causal effect rather than just a correlation. In other words, the researchers were looking for a causal relationship between the shingles vaccine and the risk of developing dementia, not just a random connection between the two factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In economics, threshold values and target dates – in this case, the individuals’ birthdays – are often employed to test for causal effects using regression discontinuity designs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This method is widely used in economics but has not yet been adequately recognized as a tool for clinical research,” Eyting added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his view, regression discontinuity analyses offer many opportunities for evaluating the effectiveness of public health measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markus Eyting is a postdoctoral researcher at the Gutenberg School of Management and Economics (GSME) of Mainz University and at the Leibniz Institute for Financial Research SAFE in Frankfurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His research focuses on experimental methods and survey and administrative data to study the interplay of beliefs and individual decision making with applications relating to health, discrimination, and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also involved in the study were Dr. Simon Heß of the Vienna University of Economics and Business, who supported the data analysis with his expertise in econometric methodologies, as well as researchers from Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eyting received the 2023 Young Economist Award from the European Economic Association (EEA) for a paper on the cause of discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this vaccines and dementia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f49f95809c869d9ada829b9d9380b4819a9dd999959d9a8eda9091" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kathrin Voigt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uni-mainz.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Kathrin Voigt – Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08800-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A natural experiment on the effect of herpes zoster vaccination on dementia&lt;/a&gt;” by Markus Eyting et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A natural experiment on the effect of herpes zoster vaccination on dementia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurotropic herpesviruses may be implicated in the development of dementia. Moreover, vaccines may have important off-target immunological effects. Here we aim to determine the effect of live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccination on the occurrence of dementia diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To provide causal as opposed to correlational evidence, we take advantage of the fact that, in Wales, eligibility for the zoster vaccine was determined on the basis of an individual’s exact date of birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those born before 2 September 1933 were ineligible and remained ineligible for life, whereas those born on or after 2 September 1933 were eligible for at least 1 year to receive the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using large-scale electronic health record data, we first show that the percentage of adults who received the vaccine increased from 0.01% among patients who were merely 1 week too old to be eligible, to 47.2% among those who were just 1 week younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from this large difference in the probability of ever receiving the zoster vaccine, individuals born just 1 week before 2 September 1933 are unlikely to differ systematically from those born 1 week later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using these comparison groups in a regression discontinuity design, we show that receiving the zoster vaccine reduced the probability of a new dementia diagnosis over a follow-up period of 7 years by 3.5 percentage points (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.6–7.1, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.019), corresponding to a 20.0% (95% CI = 6.5–33.4) relative reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This protective effect was stronger among women than men. We successfully confirm our findings in a different population (England and Wales’s combined population), with a different type of data (death certificates) and using an outcome (deaths with dementia as primary cause) that is closely related to dementia, but less reliant on a timely diagnosis of dementia by the healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the use of a unique natural experiment, this study provides evidence of a dementia-preventing or dementia-delaying effect from zoster vaccination that is less vulnerable to confounding and bias than the existing associational evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="inline-recommendations"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 13:14:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFBWZTVuTElSMkZhMktOWncwLU1ERnFDT3hkWXZKYlY1QnQyMlR3Wm5wRjF0N2FDczlXLWNKckJhUmwyR0ZaOW01ZTRtUmlRUktWbUhLYm0xU3VqNHpMbFluN1lUMlFCbWxCV2Uwb2V3</guid></item><item><title>I’m a brain health expert.

&lt;p&gt;Most times you read about a ‘cure’ in the news, you’ll find out towards the end of the story that it’s just a ‘potential’ cure, or that someone has been ‘seemingly cured.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But from Palm Beach, Florida comes the story that 72-year-old Orlando Avendaño has been cured of his essential hand tremor, and we can also say the cure, which took just a few hours, was fully covered by Medicare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avendaño has lived with the hand tremor for more than 30 years, and basic fine motor movements like writing his name or eating with a fork are beyond him. Picking up a cup of water has to be done with both hands, and he prefers to eat with a big spoon at dinnertime because he can better disguise his tremor that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Delray Medical Center however can remove an essential hand tremor using targeted ultrasound, a procedure already approved and available around the US. It uses the same high-frequency sound waves that bats use for echolocation, and that an OBGYN uses to image a fetus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Delray, the ultrasound is turned into a weapon through a piece of headgear called Neuravive that can deliver precise applications of ultrasonic waves into any part of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developed &lt;a href="https://insightec.com/lp/essential-tremor-int-reskin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;by Insightec&lt;/a&gt;, the headgear is guided in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging, and, as well as being covered by Medicare, is also covered in 22 different Blue Cross Blue Shield plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avendaño arrived at Delray in the early morning for his procedure. He equipped the headgear and was placed in an MRI machine where neurosurgeon Dr. Lloyd Zucker was able to detect the exact spot in the brain where the tremor originated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cutting-edge technology then created a small lesion in the brain which “knocked out” the tremor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the need for surgery or anesthesia, and after just a few hours, Avendaño emerged and held up his hand: stiff as a board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh my God, it’s unbelievable,” he said after coming out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captured on camera by NBC 6, it was difficult to tell who was happier, Avendaño or Dr. Zucker, who called the procedure his “magic track.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s probably the most wonderful thing. I’ve been doing it for years, and as you can see as I start to smile, you can’t take this away, when you see the patients and the families and what it does for them,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“Avoid screens before bed” is one of the most common pieces of sleep advice. But what if the real problem isn’t screen time − it’s the way we use social media at night?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleep deprivation is one of the most widespread yet overlooked &lt;a href="https://aasm.org/u-s-surgeon-general-discusses-the-importance-of-healthy-sleep/"&gt;public health issues&lt;/a&gt;, especially among young adults and adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite needing eight to 10 hours of sleep, &lt;a href="https://childmind.org/article/happens-teenagers-dont-get-enough-sleep/"&gt;most adolescents&lt;/a&gt; fall short, while &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.52965/001c.74555"&gt;nearly two-thirds of young adults&lt;/a&gt; regularly get less than the recommended &lt;a href="https://www.thensf.org/how-many-hours-of-sleep-do-you-really-need/"&gt;seven to nine hours&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor sleep isn’t just about feeling tired − it’s linked to worsened &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/screen-time-is-contributing-to-chronic-sleep-deprivation-in-tweens-and-teens-a-pediatric-sleep-expert-explains-how-critical-sleep-is-to-kids-mental-health-204436"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smrv.2015.12.006"&gt;emotion regulation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/memory-and-sleep"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2209123120"&gt;academic performance&lt;/a&gt; and even increased risk for &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/the-effects-of-sleep-deprivation"&gt;chronic illness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/33.5.585"&gt;early mortality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/04/07/social-media-use-in-2021/"&gt;social media is nearly universal&lt;/a&gt; among young adults, with 84% using at least one platform daily. While research has long focused on &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/school-start-times-and-screen-time-late-in-the-evening-exacerbate-sleep-deprivation-in-us-teenagers-179178"&gt;screen time&lt;/a&gt; as the culprit for poor sleep, growing evidence suggests that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2016.01.001"&gt;how often&lt;/a&gt; people check social media − and how &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adolescence.2016.05.008"&gt;emotionally engaged&lt;/a&gt; they are − matters even more than how long they spend online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eXIhdAUAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;social psychologist and sleep researcher&lt;/a&gt;, I study how social behaviors, including social media habits, affect sleep and well-being. Sleep isn’t just an individual behavior; it’s shaped by our &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsmc.2016.10.012"&gt;social environments and relationships&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one of the most common yet underestimated factors shaping modern sleep? How we engage with social media before bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Emotional investment in social media&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond simply measuring time spent on social media, researchers have started looking at how &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/a0030277"&gt;emotionally connected&lt;/a&gt; people feel to their social media use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some studies suggest that the way people emotionally engage with social media may have a greater impact on sleep quality than the total time they spend online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a 2024 study of 830 young adults, my colleagues and I examined how different types of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/bs14090794"&gt;social media engagement predicted sleep problems&lt;/a&gt;. We found that frequent social media visits and emotional investment were stronger predictors of poor sleep than total screen time. Additionally, presleep cognitive arousal and social comparison played a key role in linking social media engagement to sleep disruption, suggesting that social media’s effects on sleep extend beyond simple screen exposure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe these findings suggest that cutting screen time alone may not be enough − reducing how often people check social media and how emotionally connected they feel to it may be more effective in promoting healthier sleep habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How social media disrupts sleep&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever struggled to fall asleep after scrolling through social media, it’s not just the screen keeping you awake. While blue light can &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side"&gt;delay melatonin production&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/bs14090794"&gt;my team’s research&lt;/a&gt; and that of others suggests that the way people interact with social media may play an even bigger role in &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/sleep-and-social-media"&gt;sleep disruption&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the biggest ways social media interferes with your sleep:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presleep arousal:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/doomscrolling-dangers"&gt;Doomscrolling&lt;/a&gt; and emotionally charged content on social media keeps your brain in a state of heightened alertness, making it harder to relax and fall asleep. Whether it’s political debates, distressing news or even exciting personal updates, emotionally stimulating content can trigger increased &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/20501579211056116"&gt;cognitive and physiological arousal&lt;/a&gt; that delays sleep onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social comparison:&lt;/strong&gt; Viewing idealized social media posts before bed can lead to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15213269.2023.2180647"&gt;upward social comparison&lt;/a&gt;, increasing stress and making it harder to sleep. People tend to compare themselves to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1556/2006.2022.00023"&gt;highly curated versions of others’ lives&lt;/a&gt; − vacations, fitness progress, career milestones − which can lead to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15213269.2016.1267647"&gt;feelings of inadequacy and anxiety&lt;/a&gt; that disrupt sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habitual checking:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-news/how-does-social-media-affect-sleep"&gt;Social media use after lights out&lt;/a&gt; is a strong predictor of poor sleep, as checking notifications and scrolling before bed can quickly become an automatic habit. Studies have shown that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adolescence.2018.07.009"&gt;nighttime-specific social media use&lt;/a&gt;, especially after lights are out, is linked to shorter sleep duration, later bedtimes and lower sleep quality. This pattern reflects &lt;a href="https://time.com/6957353/bedtime-procrastination-how-to-go-to-sleep/"&gt;bedtime procrastination&lt;/a&gt;, where people delay sleep despite knowing it would be better for their health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear of missing out, or FOMO:&lt;/strong&gt; The urge to stay connected also keeps many people scrolling long past their intended bedtime, making sleep feel secondary to staying updated. Research shows that higher &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/feeling-fomo-for-something-thats-not-even-fun-its-not-the-event-youre-missing-its-the-bonding-247047"&gt;FOMO levels&lt;/a&gt; are linked to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2020.106487"&gt;more frequent nighttime social media use&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-023-16061-4"&gt;poorer sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;. The anticipation of new messages, posts or updates can create a sense of social pressure to stay online and reinforce the habit of delaying sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these factors make social media more than just a passive distraction − it becomes an active barrier to restful sleep. In other words, that late-night scroll isn’t harmless − it’s quietly rewiring your sleep and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to use social media without sleep disruption&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to quit social media, but restructuring how you engage with it at night could help. Research suggests that small &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/whats-the-best-diet-for-healthy-sleep-a-nutritional-epidemiologist-explains-what-food-choices-will-help-you-get-more-restful-zs-219955"&gt;behavioral changes&lt;/a&gt; to your &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-hygiene/bedtime-routine-for-adults"&gt;bedtime routine&lt;/a&gt; can make a significant difference in sleep quality. I suggest trying these practical, evidence-backed strategies for improving your sleep:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give your brain time to wind down:&lt;/strong&gt; Avoid emotionally charged content 30 to 60 minutes before bed to help your mind relax and prepare for sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create separation between social media and sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Set your phone to “Do Not Disturb” or leave it outside the bedroom to avoid the temptation of late-night checking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce mindless scrolling:&lt;/strong&gt; If you catch yourself endlessly refreshing, take a &lt;a href="https://www.activeminds.org/blog/mindful-consumption-of-social-media-can-support-our-mental-health/"&gt;small, mindful pause&lt;/a&gt; and ask yourself: “Do I actually want to be on this app right now?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brief moment of awareness can help break the habit loop.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

Using a wearable quantum brain scanner, researchers measured gamma waves in over 100 individuals aged 2 to 34.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scanner, designed with optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs), allows for noninvasive brain imaging even in very young children. This method opens new doors for understanding and diagnosing neurodevelopmental conditions like autism much earlier than previously possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excitation-Inhibition Balance:&lt;/strong&gt; Excitatory processes decline and inhibitory processes rise with age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wearable MEG Technology:&lt;/strong&gt; A child-friendly scanner captures real-time brain activity in even toddlers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Relevance:&lt;/strong&gt; Establishes a developmental benchmark to better understand disorders like autism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Nottingham&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study has shown how aspects of brain function change with age, revealing that excitatory processes in the brain decrease, while inhibitory processes increase as children get older. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are an important step in understanding disorders like autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108459"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a baby in a futuristic brain scan helmet." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The research teams in both institutions are working together to expand the range and extent of neurodevelopmental data, in both healthy and atypical brain populations.Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain function is based on a delicate balance of excitatory processes (which make brain cells fire) and inhibitory processes (which stop brain cells firing) – this is known as the E-I balance. Usually, to measure this, sensors would need to be placed in the brain (which requires experimental surgery and so cannot be routinely done in humans).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this new study, published today in &lt;em&gt;Imaging Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, scientists have shown that it can be measured using a novel wearable brain scanner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Nottingham and The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in Toronto scanned the brains of 101 healthy children and adults between the ages of 2 and 34 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a wearable design of magnetoencephalography (MEG) scanner, the team were able to measure high frequency brain waves (known as gamma waves) that are generated in brain circuits that rely on both excitatory and inhibitory inputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers showed that gamma waves change significantly with age, with low amplitude broadband waves in children and high amplitude narrowband waves in adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using biophysical models of the measured gamma waves, the research team were then able to translate their findings into measurements of E-I balance, showing that as children get older excitatory processes decrease, while inhibitory processes increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trajectory is critical for healthy brain development and is understood to be atypical in older children and adults with psychiatric disorders. This provides a benchmark (in typically developing young children) against which disorders like autism can be understood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychiatric disorders are due to atypical brain function, which can be measured with a range of brain imaging technologies, such as MRI, EEG and MEG. Childhood disorders, however, can emerge in the early years of life (2-4 years of age), but there are limited ways to investigate the brain function in children who are this young. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wearable brain scanner is based on quantum technology, and uses LEGO-brick-sized sensors – called optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) – which are incorporated into a lightweight helmet to measure the magnetic fields generated by brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unique design means the system can be adapted to fit any age group, including very young children. The system takes only seconds to set up, and children wear it and can move freely during a scan. It is therefore ideally suited to scanning children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Matthew Brookes from the University of Nottingham’s Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre has led the development of the new technology which is now being installed across the world by Nottingham-based spin-out company Cerca Magnetics, he said: “Quantum technologies have revolutionised what is possible with brain imaging. 10 years ago measuring MEG signals in very young children as they move around freely, whilst wearing what is essentially a hat, seemed like science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now, it’s possible and it’s opening up new worlds of possibility – particularly related to the developing brain in the early years of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;World renowned neuroscientist Dr Margot Taylor – who leads autism research at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto – said: “OPM technology allows us to complete studies in young children that were simply not possible otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are able to obtain fantastic data in one-year-olds; our next frontier is having the same success in infants from birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We expect that these studies will give us better understanding of the early onset of neurodevelopmental disorders, which will help in the care of the children in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was led by Dr Natalie Rhodes who, following undergraduate and postgraduate study at the University of Nottingham, moved to Toronto to continue her scientific career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said: “Just like a well-tuned orchestra, our brains rely on a delicate balance of signals. We now have a way to measure how this balance changes from early life to adulthood and can use this to better understand developmental differences in conditions like autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that an imbalance in brain signals is linked to neurodevelopmental conditions, but until now, we haven’t had a suitable method to measure it in young children. Using OPM technology, we can now study brain function with unprecedented precision from very young children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The University of Nottingham launched Cerca Magnetics in 2020 to commercialise OPM-MEG scanners and related technologies. The wearable system has been installed in a number of high profile research institutions across the globe, including at SickKids in Toronto where around half of the volunteers in the current study were scanned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research teams in both institutions are working together to expand the range and extent of neurodevelopmental data, in both healthy and atypical brain populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by a healthcare impact partnership grant, awarded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) in the UK. The authors have also wish to acknowledge the UK quantum technologies programme and in particular the Quantum Hub for Sensors Imaging and Timing (QuSIT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work at SickKids was supported by the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI; 2021) and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurotech and brain aging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#36535b5b5718425e5944585376585942425f58515e575b18575518435d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Emma Thorne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nottingham.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Emma Thorne – University of Nottingham&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/imag_a_00527/128456/Measuring-the-neurodevelopmental-trajectory-of" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Measuring the neurodevelopmental trajectory of excitatory-inhibitory balance via visual gamma oscillations&lt;/a&gt;” by Natalie Rhodes et al. &lt;em&gt;Imaging Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measuring the neurodevelopmental trajectory of excitatory-inhibitory balance via visual gamma oscillations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disruption of the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission (E-I balance) is thought to underlie many neurodevelopmental disorders; however, its study is typically restricted to adults, animal models, and the lab-bench.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurophysiological oscillations in the gamma frequency band relate closely to E-I balance, and a new technology—OPM-MEG—offers the possibility to measure such signals across the lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used OPM-MEG to measure gamma oscillations induced by visual stimulation in 101 participants, aged 2–34 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate a significantly changing spectrum with age, with low-amplitude broadband gamma oscillations in children and high-amplitude band limited oscillations in adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used a canonical cortical microcircuit to model these signals, revealing a significant decrease in the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory signalling with age in the superficial pyramidal neurons of the visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings detail the first MEG metrics of gamma oscillations and their underlying generators from toddlerhood, providing a benchmark against which future studies can contextualise.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 12:32:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE5aVkZqV3M5aFpIRUZGVkt2RW4xOXh2Y3lzSGg2OGNESHR5UE14WTV1YmkzN19NUVFQa1hNdy1TeXNJS2NIZUgyendLQWhoNFZvTC10bFoxVjdkMFZRUzRiMzM0RTdDaE1nX3BlSVJqdXZINFlW</guid></item><item><title>I Was Caring For A Patient With Down Syndrome.

You were &lt;em&gt;so kind &lt;/em&gt;to that little boy!” a pediatric resident told me with a saccharine and insincere tone. I was a third-year medical student, and she’d pulled me aside after she’d witnessed me giggling and zipping trucks along bedrails with a patient. I was also a 25-year-old woman who lacked a professional filter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Why wouldn’t I be kind?” I blurted out. My voice mirrored my grandmother’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember if the child was experiencing a specific ailment commonly coupled with his Down syndrome, such as leukemia or a structural heart or digestive condition, or if he was hospitalized for a typical pediatric problem like asthma, appendicitis or some accidental injury. What I remember is the resident’s eyebrows arching and her lips pursing. I realized too late she’d expected me to just say “thank you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I trained my eyes on the tiny plastic frog dangling from her stethoscope. The amphibious toy meant to distract children while she auscultated their hearts and lungs couldn’t distract me from the sound of my pounding heart. We stood silently facing each other in the hospital corridor, until I heard the little boy’s Tonka truck clank to the floor. Saved by gravity, I pivoted back into his room to pick it up with echoes of my grandmother’s yelling buzzing in my ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty years earlier, my grandmother Yetta reprimanded me and my cousin for tumbling headfirst down the half-flight of carpeted stairs in her split-level house, wearing the smocked Polly Flinders dresses she’d bought us. It would take me another 20 years to understand that my grandmother’s reprimands captured her purest expression of acceptance toward my cousin Becky, who has Down syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My grandmother’s words bit the air: “Rachel, Rebecca, stop it!” She was a staunch woman with curly jet-black hair who audited taxes for the IRS while raising three boys and running a luncheonette with my grandfather. She had zero tolerance for nonsense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight of her grandchildren called her Granny, but not Becky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not Ede. Granny,” my grandmother would chide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always, my cousin smiled. “No. Ede.” Becky never explained why she used this name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And always, my grandmother smiled back. Their lighthearted refrain was a familiar script interjected between my grandmother’s complaints about the way my grandfather chewed everything he ate and how long it took him to do his daily crossword puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Rebecca Fleishman (left) and the author in Lake George, New York, in 1980.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Charles Fleishman"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Charles Fleishman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becky was a year older than me. We spent our elementary school days playing hide-and-seek with our brothers, middle school swimming in her parents’ backyard pool, and high school changing into team swimsuits in our school locker room. My grandparents eventually moved to Florida while Becky and I were still waving hello to each other across our school cafeteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Becky and I finished high school in the late ’90s, she moved to California with her mom and stepfather, and I moved to New York City for college and medical school. While I spent the bulk of my time in libraries, Becky completed vocational training and then worked at a bowling alley, and our grandmother discovered email. She sent Becky countless messages from her handle, GranEde, and Becky always replied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t meant to be rude by rejecting the resident’s compliment, but my actions didn’t feel praiseworthy or even unusual. The world I knew before medical school was the one modeled by the adults who’d raised me. I’d always known that people with Down syndrome have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/birth-defects/about/down-syndrome.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="distinct physical features " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e55e02e4b08ebfbbf9896f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/birth-defects/about/down-syndrome.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;distinct physical features &lt;/a&gt;— what the medical literature calls “stigmata” — and a propensity for certain health conditions and disabilities, but I had never witnessed how they can be &lt;a href="https://migrationletters.com/index.php/ml/article/view/9307/6054" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="subjected to" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e55e02e4b08ebfbbf9896f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://migrationletters.com/index.php/ml/article/view/9307/6054" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;subjected to&lt;/a&gt; harassment, humiliation, mistreatment and neglect, both in hospitals and outside them. I’d come to learn that “stigma,” a concept put &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357279828_Ervin_Goffman's_perspectives_on_contemporary_social_realities/link/6214b09a08bee946f395e13a/download?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIiwicGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIn19" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="forth by Erving Goffman" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e55e02e4b08ebfbbf9896f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357279828_Ervin_Goffman's_perspectives_on_contemporary_social_realities/link/6214b09a08bee946f395e13a/download?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIiwicGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIn19" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;forth by Erving Goffman&lt;/a&gt;, encompassed “disgrace attached to a particular condition or trait.” I’d never perceived Becky as stigmatized because our family did not isolate her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades after high school, Becky and I were mostly out of touch. I asked family members about her. I liked her &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/impact/topic/facebook"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; posts. But my strongest connection to Becky was through my grandmother. When I flew to Florida for visits, my grandmother, in between digging through the sale rack at Bloomingdale’s and instructing the deli workers at Publix about the proper thickness of turkey breast slices, gave me the scoop on Becky. She told me about the races Becky swam in the Special Olympics and the volunteer work she did. And she told me, over and over, about the day she took Becky out for Chinese food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becky was in her late 20s at the time. My grandmother knew my cousin’s attitude about reading was inconsistent, but she refused to capitulate to Becky’s refusals. My grandmother handed her a menu. She waited. My cousin perused it and then announced to the waitress that she wanted “the happy family.” My grandmother, who once sat my father at the dinner table for hours because he refused to eat his peas, scoured the menu and discovered “the happy family” was a combination of several dishes, meant to serve six. She resigned herself to taking home leftovers because Becky had, after all, read the menu. Every time I heard this story, I believed my cousin picked “the happy family” not only because she wanted to eat what was in it, but because the words captured how she felt sitting in a sticky leather booth across from a woman who cherished her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Rebecca Fleishman (left) and the author at Becky’s bat mitzvah.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Sylvia Ginsberg"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Sylvia Ginsberg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was early in my residency the first time I cared for a baby diagnosed with Down syndrome after birth. Becky was not on my mind as I sat, silent, beside my neonatologist mentor while she told a husband and wife that their 1-hour-old child might have this genetic condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prenatal testing, which from the narrow perspective of a pediatrician affords parents the benefit of emotional, intellectual and medical preparation before their babies are born, had not flagged the possibility. Two teaspoons of blood drawn after the 10th week of pregnancy, known as “noninvasive prenatal testing,” identifies more than 99% of fetuses with Down syndrome. But this test wasn’t available back then, when a combination of first and second trimester blood tests and ultrasounds (still sometimes done today) &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2020/0415/p481.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="identified many but not all" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e55e02e4b08ebfbbf9896f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2020/0415/p481.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;identified many but not all&lt;/a&gt; fetuses with Down syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becky was not on my mind as my mentor asked the baby’s name. I was transfixed by the way she spoke with purpose, and without judgment or pity — without implying Down syndrome was bad or tragic. She pointed out the physical features typical for Down syndrome and then asked the parents what they saw as we all peered at the baby’s face, hands and toes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families receive medical information differently. Some families readily believe the impressions of a physician, some want confirmatory genetic testing before accepting this diagnosis, while still others need time to process before engaging in further dialogue with doctors. My mentor’s goal was to inform the family of the possibility that the child had Down syndrome, not to convince them she was right. The only urgency she had was to build trust. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation had been so honest, so compassionate, so pure, that I left the room enchanted with the spell of human connection. I’d never considered that, as a doctor, I could learn to cast sacred spells with words. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so I became a neonatologist — in part because of that mentor and the glittering moment of truth she’d conveyed with raw kindness, and in part so I could chase the same sparkling connections with families navigating the delight of babies’ births while accepting their concomitant medical diagnoses. Most of my patients are either born prematurely or born on time but unexpectedly sick. Almost every day, I reassure families that neonatal intensive care is likely to allow their children to survive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1866, Dr. John Langdon Down published a medical paper whose now-offensive title, “&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7707939/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Observations on the Ethnic Classification of Idiots" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e55e02e4b08ebfbbf9896f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7707939/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Observations on the Ethnic Classification of Idiots&lt;/a&gt;,” obscures the importance of describing, and thereby lending medical legitimacy and attention to, human beings with Down syndrome. In 1959, not quite 20 years before Becky’s birth, the discovery that Down syndrome was caused by an extra 21st chromosome established the first link between an intellectual disability and genetics and paved the way for prenatal diagnostics. Since the 1970s, Down syndrome is &lt;a href="https://docs.downsyndromepopulation.org/factsheets/down-syndrome-population-usa-factsheet.pdf" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="increasingly prevalent" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e55e02e4b08ebfbbf9896f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://docs.downsyndromepopulation.org/factsheets/down-syndrome-population-usa-factsheet.pdf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;increasingly prevalent&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, while rates have simultaneously declined in &lt;a href="https://docs.downsyndromepopulation.org/factsheets/down-syndrome-population-europe-factsheet.pdf" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Europe" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e55e02e4b08ebfbbf9896f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://docs.downsyndromepopulation.org/factsheets/down-syndrome-population-europe-factsheet.pdf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnosing Down syndrome and counseling families remains a tiny part of my job. I’ve rolled stools beside new mothers during repeat C-sections to share what seemed possible. I’ve sat beside families that other doctors didn’t quite know how to approach and disclosed the truth myself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each time I have these high-stakes conversations, I roll my shoulders back, feel my sternum rise with my inhalations as I beckon reverence into these hospital rooms. I watch parental eyebrows and pupils and fingers clenching or unclenching as I utter measured words and allow conversations to bloom with unbridled parental emotion and exploratory questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a long time, I refrained from sharing stories about my cousin because Becky is only one person with a common condition that affects &lt;a href="https://www.globaldownsyndrome.org/about-down-syndrome/facts-about-down-syndrome/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="6 million people" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e55e02e4b08ebfbbf9896f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.globaldownsyndrome.org/about-down-syndrome/facts-about-down-syndrome/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;6 million people&lt;/a&gt; differently. I didn’t want to inject her life story into these families’ stories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Bernard Fleishman (Becky's grandpa, left), Becky Fleishman, and Yetta Fleishman (Becky's grandma) at Becky’s bat mitzvah&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Sylvia Ginsberg"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Sylvia Ginsberg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was several years into my career as a neonatologist when my grandmother died and I lost my connection to Becky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becky wasn’t at the funeral. No one quite knew how to tell her what had happened, and taking Becky across the country while everyone was grieving wasn’t feasible. My extended family shared stories of my grandmother. When it was my turn at the podium in that South Florida funeral home, I rambled, crying because I loved her for her freely expressed opinions. I mumbled about seagulls and almost sat down to sob into my husband’s blazer, when, from the depth of my grief, I shared an unscripted sentiment that sounds obvious only in hindsight: “How Granny treated Becky had a profound impact on me as a pediatrician.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I flew home to Philadelphia at peace with my grief-stricken insight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never thought to call Becky or ask how she’d taken the news about Ede. I mailed holiday cards from Philadelphia to San Diego every December. Some years, she mailed back photos of herself making scratch pizzas and pastries. When I saw Facebook photos of her 40th birthday at Disneyland, I was ecstatic. Mostly, though, Becky and I remained out of touch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then, three years after my grandmother died, I reconnected with Becky’s mom. Because of divorce and distance, I hadn’t spoken to my Aunt Sylvia since I was a teenager. I was struck, as I listened to her stories about Becky, by how much I missed my cousin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To this day, Becky will tell you she doesn’t have Down syndrome,” my aunt told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s because she was raised to believe she can do anything she wants,” I replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The diagnosis was a surprise,” my aunt explained. “The doctors told me lots of stuff that was just wrong.” They didn’t think Becky would breastfeed. They said she wouldn’t lift her head for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was appalled. I’ve cared for babies with Down syndrome with these challenges. But I’ve also cared for babies who did not have them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After Becky was born, one of the doctors told us she belonged in an institution.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wait, what?!” I hadn’t known that. As a pediatrician, I couldn’t fathom advising parents to give away a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The little I knew about institutions for disabled people I’d learned from watching &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/geraldo-rivera"&gt;Geraldo Rivera&lt;/a&gt;’s documentary “&lt;a href="https://abc7ny.com/willowbrook-geraldo-rivera-staten-island-bill-ritter/11575075/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Willowbrook: The Last Disgrace" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e55e02e4b08ebfbbf9896f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://abc7ny.com/willowbrook-geraldo-rivera-staten-island-bill-ritter/11575075/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;Willowbrook: The Last Disgrace&lt;/a&gt;,” which came about after a doctor was fired from the &lt;a href="https://disabilityjustice.org/the-closing-of-willowbrook/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Willowbrook Developmental Center" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e55e02e4b08ebfbbf9896f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://disabilityjustice.org/the-closing-of-willowbrook/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;Willowbrook Developmental Center&lt;/a&gt; because he tried to champion humane care for the 5,230 people who lived there in the early ’70s.

If Becky didn’t come home, he suggested adoption as an alternative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But your grandmother wouldn’t hear of it.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt my eyes wrinkle and a flash of warmth. “What did she do?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She marched into my hospital room,” my aunt recounted. “She said, ‘You’d bring a puppy home to be taken care of — she’s your daughter. You are bringing her home!’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was my grandmother. A firebrand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My aunt gave me a gift that day. I hadn’t known I’d spent my career manifesting words uttered a year before I was born. I flashed back to countless babies’ bedsides, to families who held their children, desperate for them to get better, survive, go home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever it took, whatever their children needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;What those families craved, all of them, was hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author (lower right) FaceTiming with Becky Fleishman (left) and her aunt Sylvia Ginsberg.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Sylvia Ginsberg"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Sylvia Ginsberg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I began to think more about Becky when parents whose children had Down syndrome asked me about what the world might be like far into the future: “Will she learn to read?” “Will he ever join the football team?” “Will she get a job?” “Will he get married?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few months after I spoke to my aunt, I cared for a child with Down syndrome who required extra medical care after birth. I sat beside the baby’s crib, talking to his mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The space behind my sternum opened. I felt close to my grandmother, despite her death, and to Becky, who I never saw. My whole life, I never once heard my grandmother comment about the implications of disability. To label Becky as someone with disabilities felt like labeling the morning sky as a single color — an overly simplistic categorization of a nuanced person whose moods and gifts and antics shifted as quickly as the sun rises. She modeled acceptance through her actions — by treating Becky as, simply, herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;That mother’s eyes met mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve never met someone with this,” she confided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Would you like to?” I asked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I told her about Becky, about all she’d accomplished, about how much she was loved. I pulled out my phone and showed her a photo of my cousin in aviator sunglasses and a leather jacket. Beaming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mother clutched my phone, smiling, as her son opened his eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I worked on this essay, I sent a draft to my aunt so she and Becky could weigh in. When my aunt first read it to Becky, Becky smiled the whole time. They were then gracious enough to FaceTime with me so I could ask Becky’s thoughts myself. As my aunt and I reminisced, Becky waved and smiled. Her expressive language is waning (perhaps related to early Alzheimer’s that afflicts some middle-age adults with Down syndrome), but she knew me and was excited to see me. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My aunt’s stories about times when people underestimated Becky’s ability to understand everyone around her reminded me that my cousin has always been a prankster. I asked Becky if she remembers the above stories. Hide-and-seek? High school hallways? So much swimming? Yes, she said to each memory I offered. Did she remember Ede? She offered a wide grin. I asked her if I could publish this piece about her. With a serious expression, she again said yes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Any one of us can only be who we are. Who we are, and who we become, is shaped by the people who raised us and the people we know, but also by the people we meet and the people we read about. In the 20 years since I graduated from medical school, the patients I’ve cared for, the families I’ve served, and the mentors who trained me all shaped how I understand this world. They’ve opened my eyes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But I would not have known how to look at this world, to truly see how people move through it, had it not been for how my grandmother treated my cousin. Looking back, their relationship is easily labeled: acceptance, kindness, unconditional love. But, as a child, these things were so ingrained, I never noticed them. My grandmother gifted me an irrefutable understanding that when I am able to love and accept people for exactly who they are, I am the doctor and person I aspire to be. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

    &lt;p&gt;Imagine a glowing couple in their 20s, working and partying hard, getting precious little sleep, says gastroenterologist Shilpa Ravella. Then fast-forward 30 years and the couple may have serious health issues such as &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/diabetes/five-surprising-things-that-raise-risk-of-type-2-diabetes/"&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; or heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Late nights, drinking and stress, all these things trigger low-level inflammation which can damage our tissues and then one day it turns into heart disease or cancer,” adds Ravella. “Yes, younger bodies tend to process things more favourably. But the processed food has got worse, and &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/cancers-that-are-on-the-rise-in-the-under-50s/"&gt;young onset colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; is skyrocketing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being slim isn’t a protection, adds Ravella. “You can be at the gym lifting weights, have big muscles and a flat tummy, but still be highly inflamed. More importantly, you could have a higher risk of disease down the line, without having a clue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hidden, chronic, low-grade, systemic inflammation is a “hot topic” in health and wellness because it’s increasingly recognised as a major driver of heart disease, cancer and &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/christmas/2025/01/14/alzheimers-professor-check-research-brain-health/"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;, as well as autoimmune conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and rheumatoid arthritis (where the immune system starts to attack the healthy cells of organs and tissues). And scientists now believe “inflammaging” is one of several essential factors that drive ageing in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we age, just naturally through a combination of genetics and the sum total of our environmental exposures, our immune systems develop a natural propensity for wanting to engage in chronic inflammation,” explains Dr Nathan Curran, a&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;functional Medicine Practitioner at London’s Reborne Longevity Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we’re trying to prevent chronic disease, it needs to go beyond just screening for the disease,” he adds. “We need to be screening for the actual triggers of the disease before they emerge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What is inflammation?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation isn’t bad per se. It’s the immune system’s response to any traumatic event in the body tissues – for example, a scraped knee or finger cut. In case of “acute” inflammation, our immune system releases inflammatory cells and cytokines (small proteins that stimulate more inflammatory cells) to neutralise the invading virus or start healing injured tissue. You will experience redness, warmth and swelling, but it will be over in a matter of days. “Acute inflammation serves a very important role in keeping us alive,” &lt;strong&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt;ays Dr Curran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our evolutionary history, in order to protect our bodies from pathogens and poisons, we developed a hyperactive immune system, explains Ravella, author of &lt;em&gt;A Silent Fire: The Story of Inflammation, Diet and Disease.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is inflammation is not always harmless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chronic” inflammation happens when this response is switched on all the time, leaving your body in a constant state of alert. The body continues to send white blood cells on the attack in the absence of any threat. This disrupts normal bodily functions and can result in healthy tissues and organs being attacked. Plus your body never gets a chance to recuperate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Inflammation and cholesterol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole topic of inflammation became a bit more “personal” last October when I learnt I have “a propensity for excessive inflammation on a genetic level” when I did a DNA test at Dr Curran’s clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clues were there already: I had high cholesterol and was a point from being pre-diabetic. I sneezed incessantly (and very loudly) after too much fizz or sugar, both of which raise inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have an ‘eager/active’ variant of the gene,” Dr Curran tells me. “This means a relatively mild trigger has the potential to trigger a disproportionately large/sustained release of TNF-alpha (a pro-inflammatory protein), unless we moderate the impact of this genetic variation through an anti-inflammatory lifestyle, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/cheap-vital-why-omega-3-helps-you-live-longer/"&gt;omega-3&lt;/a&gt;s, Vitamin D and so on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I immediately Google TNF-alpha and find that, worryingly, this cytokine is implicated in acute and chronic inflammatory conditions including, sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just because you have the genetic propensity doesn’t mean it will be translated into excessive inflammation,” he adds, “but you need to be mindful of your lifestyle and dietary exposures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there’s my family’s history of heart disease to consider, too. “When cholesterol accumulates in the arteries, it creates inflammation because it gets modified and oxidised,” explains British Heart Foundation Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at the University of Cambridge, Ziad Mallat. “And then the body recognises it as a stranger. This inflammation initially serves to clear the oxidised cholesterol from the arteries. But when the body is exposed continuously to this aggression, the clearance capacities become overwhelmed and the inflammation becomes chronic. This causes more build-up of fatty material in the arteries and later may create clots in the arteries, and cause heart attack and stroke. The same thing happens when you have high glucose in diabetes, or if you smoke; it causes injury to the arteries and that creates chronic inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shock motivated me to change my diet (&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/gave-up-sugar-month/"&gt;I gave up free sugar,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/heart-health/reduce-cholesterol-without-statins/"&gt;brought my cholesterol &lt;/a&gt;down naturally for this paper). Then in March I asked my GP for a CRP (C-reactive protein) blood test (CRP is produced by the liver and if there’s a higher concentration of CRP than usual, it’s a sign of inflammation) and, phew, it’s normal at the moment. The sneezing has stopped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You were really lucky, because your sneezing was so obvious and not everybody has that,” says Thaddeus Stappenbeck, MD, PhD chair of Inflammation and Immunity at Cleveland Clinic. “Most people have more vague symptoms, like they don’t have the energy they used to, or they’re not sleeping well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Cleveland Clinic, Dr Thaddeus’s research programme focuses on determining the root causes of inflammatory diseases with the goal of developing new therapies. “With certain types of inflammatory conditions, they can programme parts of your immune system so they simply malfunction which further fuels inflammation later. A really good example is sepsis. Patients who have had bloodstream infections and spent time in intensive care, if they survive and are able to leave the hospital, what’s well recognised is that parts of their immune system are no longer functional. So they’re at risk for repeat infections with worse overall inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The role of diet and the gut microbiome in inflammation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The function of the immune system is to protect us from invaders—and to be able to tell apart the cells of our own body from other cells that don’t belong to us. And scientists have estimated that about 70 per cent of the immune system lives in the gut microbiome. Chronic inflammation in the gut may be due to inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn’s disease or &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/gut-health/ulcerative-colitis-symptoms-treatment-surgery/#:~:text=Ulcerative%20colitis%20is%20an%20inflammatory,which%20bleed%20and%20leak%20pus."&gt;ulcerative colitis&lt;/a&gt;. But a modern Western diet high in &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/rob-hobson-family-cooking/"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; can literally cause our whole body to be on fire, too. The poorer the quality of a meal, the higher the inflammatory response. Our microbiome (and the trillions of bugs in our intestines crucial to human health) is worryingly damaged, in contrast to our ancestors who had better gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sort of inflammation contributes to most of our “21st-century” diseases, says Dr Stappenbeck. “The link between what’s going on in your gut microbiome, and diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s or sleep disorders or depression is really amazing. We’re learning, for example, that Parkinson’s disease probably starts in many of these patients in the colon and becomes more evident once brain lesions have developed. A lot of patients with Parkinson’s have very severe constipation because the neurons in their colon are damaged and don’t function properly. They could have been experiencing that for years without realising. So could we diagnose Parkinson’s earlier before the cells of the brain are damaged?”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few decades, some studies have raised important questions about the psychological implications of the excessive use of smartphones and other portable devices. Findings suggest that people who use smartphones too much can progressively develop cognitive impairments and attentional deficits, yet the factors contributing to these effects are not yet fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Researchers at Hokkaido University recently carried out a study exploring the link between &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/smartphone+use/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;smartphone use&lt;/a&gt; and psychological processes, specifically looking at attention and physiological reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-025-00225-6" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Communications Psychology&lt;/i&gt;, suggest that people who have an &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/attentional+bias/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;attentional bias&lt;/a&gt; towards smartphone stimuli typically display a lower interoceptive awareness (i.e., they are less able to perceive and understand their bodily sensations) and are more physiologically reactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This project began as an interdisciplinary exploration between philosophy and psychology, aiming to understand the relationship between technology and the human body," Yusuke Haruki, first author of the paper, told Medical Xpress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although digital devices like smartphones have become deeply embedded in our daily lives, we still know surprisingly little about how they shape our bodily awareness and perception. We became especially interested in how attention towards smartphone-related cues in everyday situations might influence our awareness of bodily sensations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haruki and his colleagues drew parallels between excessive smartphone use and behavioral addictions, such as gambling and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/substance+use+disorders/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;substance use disorders&lt;/a&gt;. Building on this parallel, they set out to explore how smartphone-related distractions are connected to body awareness (i.e., interoception) and physiological reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 58 healthy young adults and asked them to complete a simple visual task. The objective of this task was to rapidly spot target letters that were displayed on a computer screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In the background of this task, we showed two types of images: smartphone-related images (such as a phone screen showing an incoming call) and control (scrambled) images," explained Haruki. "To understand if being distracted depended on how difficult the task was, we made the letter task easier or harder by changing how many target letters appeared on screen at the same time."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the time it took for participants to respond to stimuli (i.e., their reaction times) in these different conditions, the researchers divided them into two different groups, using a clustering method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first group contained people who were consistently distracted by smartphone images, irrespective of how difficult the task was, while the second contained people who were only distracted by these images when the task was easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Next, we compared these two groups using questionnaires to see if the consistently distracted group reported lower awareness of their own bodily signals," said Haruki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Finally, we also checked if this same group showed stronger heart rate increases when seeing smartphone images, indicating greater physiological reactivity to these cues."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, the researchers found that even if smartphone-related images were irrelevant to the visual task they employed in their experiment, they captured the attention of approximately half of participants. These participants struggled to pay attention to the task at hand, while also exhibiting stronger &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physiological+reactions/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physiological reactions&lt;/a&gt; when smartphone-related images appeared.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"Participants who were more distracted by smartphone cues not only performed worse on the attention task but also showed accelerated heart rates when exposed to these images," said Haruki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Importantly, these individuals also reported lower interoceptive awareness, meaning they were less attuned to internal bodily signals such as their heartbeat—a pattern mirroring behavioral addictions like gambling or substance use."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results of this recent study suggest that some people might find it hard to ignore stimuli originating from their smartphone, such as incoming calls, texts, emails, etc., both due to mental processes and their physiological responses. Haruki and his colleagues hope that the new insight they gathered will help to better understand the link between smartphone use, attention-related processes and bodily self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our work could also potentially inform interventions aimed at promoting healthier digital habits, especially among younger populations," added Haruki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In our next studies, we plan to study what happens in the brain when people are distracted by smartphones, and how this pattern develops over time. We're especially interested in how these attentional patterns relate to brain activity and whether early signs can be found during adolescence or young adulthood."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long looked to nature for &lt;strong&gt;solutions&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;human health challenges&lt;/strong&gt;, and a new research initiative may be on the cusp of discovering something extraordinary. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aria.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Advanced Research + Invention Agency (ARIA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a UK government-backed organization, has announced plans to study the &lt;strong&gt;biology of queen bees&lt;/strong&gt; to potentially unlock secrets that could extend human lifespan and fertility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Mystery of Queen Bee Longevity&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Queen bees present a fascinating biological anomaly. While worker bees, which&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;share almost&lt;strong&gt; identical genetic material&lt;/strong&gt;, live only a &lt;strong&gt;few months&lt;/strong&gt;, queen bees can live for &lt;strong&gt;several years.&lt;/strong&gt; This significant difference in lifespan has captivated scientists, particularly because queen bees also remain fertile throughout their entire lives. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, their fertility is a key factor in their extended lifespan, and researchers are eager to understand how they manage to avoid the &lt;strong&gt;usual aging process&lt;/strong&gt; that affects most organisms, including humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/07/scientists-target-queen-bees-in-search-of-secret-to-longer-life" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARIA initiative &lt;/strong&gt;aims to decipher the mechanisms behind this longevity&lt;/a&gt; and continuous fertility. If scientists can unlock the biological processes that allow queen bees to defy the typical aging patterns of other bees, this could lead to breakthroughs in human health.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we are able to untangle and reassemble how nature solved these challenges for them, it could be transformative for halting aging, extending human fertility, improving organ transportation, and providing new ways to fight disease.” According to &lt;strong&gt;Yannick Wurm&lt;/strong&gt;, one of the project directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Promise of Nature-Inspired Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea of nature-inspired solutions is not new in science. Researchers have long turned to animals and plants for clues to solving human problems. From the creation of the &lt;strong&gt;Velcro fastener&lt;/strong&gt; inspired by burr seeds to the development of &lt;strong&gt;medical adhesives&lt;/strong&gt; inspired by the gecko’s remarkable ability to cling to surfaces, nature has provided invaluable insights. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers are turning their attention to the remarkable abilities of queen bees. The potential benefits of understanding bee biology go beyond just extending human life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The research could also reveal new ways to fight diseases, improve &lt;strong&gt;organ transplant&lt;/strong&gt; techniqu&lt;strong&gt;es,&lt;/strong&gt; and help manage the aging process. This could lead to a future where humans are not only living longer but also enjoying a better quality of life in their later years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Expanding the Scope of Innovation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside studying queen bees, ARIA has announced several other innovative projects aimed at solving pressing global challenges. One such project is focused on replacing plastic with biodegradable, programmable materials inspired by nature’s own designs. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers are also investigating how to harness atmospheric energy, potentially enabling unlimited flight, and manipulating the innate immune system to better combat disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;These projects demonstrate ARIA’s broader commitment to exploring the possibilities of nature-inspired technology. As scientists look more closely at the biology of queen bees, they may uncover the key to a longer, healthier life for humans—one that could change the course of medicine and biotechnology forever.&lt;/p&gt;

Before having them start taking the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/chia-seeds-vs-sabja-seeds-dietician-reveals-which-is-more-beneficial-for-your-weight-loss-journey-101744096230058.html"&gt;fibre supplement&lt;/a&gt;, we measured their vitamin D levels to ensure they had adequate amounts. Surprisingly, we found that 68% of these children had suboptimal vitamin D levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Considering South Florida is an area with plenty of sunshine year-round, this was both startling and concerning. While vitamin D can be obtained from foods, most people in the US get this vitamin primarily from skin exposure to sunlight. For youth approaching or experiencing puberty – a period of profound physiological changes, including rapid changes in bone mass – vitamin D deficiency could lead to several &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/is-eating-spicy-food-causing-you-mental-health-issues-doctor-explains-how-it-affects-your-brain-and-gut-health-101742628551529.html"&gt;health issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Connection between vitamin D and health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is involved in so many bodily functions because there are vitamin D receptors in different organs. These receptors act like docking stations for vitamin D to bind to and trigger different effects in the skin, intestine, bone, parathyroid gland, immune system and pancreas, among others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vitamin D regulates calcium levels in the body, which is key for not only building and maintaining bone mass but also the basic functioning of the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vitamin D also stimulates cell differentiation, a process in which cells become specialised to carry out specific functions. It is also essential to insulin secretion to control blood sugar levels, blood pressure regulation, muscle repair and regeneration, immune function and nutrient absorption, among many other functions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Vitamin D and gut health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vitamin D receptors in your gut improve calcium absorption and strengthen your intestinal barrier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The intestinal barrier is a layered wall that allows your gut to absorb nutrients and keep out harmful bacteria. This wall is composed of intestinal cells and proteins called tight junctions that act like bricks sealing these cells together. Tight junctions play an important role in maintaining the structure of your intestinal barrier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vitamin D receptors help your gut produce tight junctions to maintain your intestinal barrier. Research suggests that vitamin D deficiency reduces production of the receptors the nutrient binds to, subsequently reducing the seal of the intestinal wall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This weakening of the gut barrier may allow substances from the intestine to pass into the blood, causing inflammation. Disruption of the intestinal barrier is linked to many diseases, including liver disease, Type 1 diabetes, obesity and gastrointestinal conditions such as celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After discovering that so many of the participants in our MetA-Bone Trial had suboptimal vitamin D levels, we became interested in understanding how this nutrient might be affecting their gut health. For this, we also measured the strength of their intestinal barrier and associated this to their vitamin D levels in blood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We found that children with suboptimal vitamin D levels had a higher risk of damaging their intestinal barrier compared with children with optimal vitamin D levels. This finding suggests that even in healthy children, suboptimal levels of vitamin D may compromise the gut and potentially increase the risk of developing chronic diseases at an early age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Getting enough vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in the U.S. and around the world. Roughly 15.4% of children and adolescents in the U.S. were vitamin D deficient in 2017. While vitamin D deficiency has slightly decreased over time in the general U.S. population, it remains high among teens, especially children with darker skin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How can you ensure you are getting enough of this important nutrient?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Only a few foods naturally contain vitamin D. For example, vitamin D is naturally found in fatty fish – such as trout, salmon, cod and tuna – egg yolks and mushrooms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vitamin D can also be found in many fortified foods, such as dairy products like milk and cheese, plant-based milks, breakfast cereals, some orange juice brands and infant formulas. Dietary supplements are also good sources of vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For most people in the U.S., Sun exposure is their main source of vitamin D. However, how much Sun exposure you need depends on several factors, such as the melanin content of your skin. Melanin is a pigment that protects your skin from ultraviolet radiation. People with more melanin – and therefore darker skin – produce less vitamin D from Sun exposure than those with less melanin and may thus require longer Sun exposure to meet minimum requirements.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since excessive ultraviolet radiation is associated with skin cancer, clinicians typically recommend you meet your vitamin D requirements through foods and beverages. For healthy children and adults, the recommended dietary allowance of vitamin D is 600 IU, with an age-based upper limit of no more than 1,000 to 4,000 IU.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can usually meet this through a healthy diet that includes a variety of whole and unprocessed foods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers continue to uncover the extensive benefits of vitamin D in the body, supporting its indispensable role in nutrition and health. For growing children and adolescents, enough vitamin D is important for healthy development. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hindustan Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 11:21:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigJBVV95cUxPdG9PYzhCZW1ESDBlN0diQy1NZEo3al9VdDYzNGw0Q3lWT3dwZnhNbXFVSU0xcjNhMEVqV0Zsa1pzMFNfRUF0LTdOWTA1WU5xcGRuUnFyNzhFejBjclZUWFhFeHlfWDZaTEg5SlRTWXQySWpreTh0TVBqdDlic1haS1A3UjFmM3FoaUlSb2loSDEzaTBLOF9tOF9KaVlEWkkxUHFZMERFT2FXcE1hMlBYNi1CTnZxZFJ6TUprSG5UX2ljbUxzWk1BdFBFVTFMVVprVW9xc0M5c3B4bkdnVnRtQzg1Tnk3eFN3a1NINnF2aERsYi03c21mdk9HdkRUZmlMX2duSUw0OHJkQQ</guid></item><item><title>5 Common Mistakes People On Ozempic Make That Can Sabotage Results - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxOdTZoWXF4V1hMX3ZMZEk3aTFLUlFqZDRONjBQa2pXdHJUTW41Sy1lQXYtTUE0WGpva2pRdWdVV3NwNEtvbXJORHpLV2tHVUxnTlBQMDBIZFRQUFJLZUphcUtKdm9LbHZWYWcyQW1BZmRsejlUS1ozOS13MTI4OUQ4MVFqREtFUdIBiwFBVV95cUxQbGlwbnNZbkpIaWkydzAwNEI2R01Vd1k0MF9Na2hoQUlwYlJmUW5XUUtzWEY0TUtXdHdnSlIza3gwWWN0dGtxME9LSmk1NERfTzJvc2ZLSE02eTRieFMtX285NVRrNmtITnJHYzZOMmxrYk1xUXk5cUhYaTlpc1NiRzI3Sk1aWkxBX2pF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re currently taking a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ozempic-wegovy-what-to-know_l_64e3dd19e4b0306c321b1156" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="prescription weight loss medication" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="64e3dd19e4b0306c321b1156" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;prescription weight loss medication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; such as Ozempic, Wegovy, Saxenda or Zepbound (or you’re considering taking one), you likely already know that it’s still important to eat a balanced diet of nutrient-rich foods. Ozempic (and drugs like it) aren’t magic. They won’t lead to long-lasting weight loss if you take them while eating a diet consisting of nutrient-void, &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ultra-processed-foods_l_66db5dd9e4b07b62af62d0f8" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="ultra-processed foods" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="66db5dd9e4b07b62af62d0f8" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But what about the less obvious food rules you might not know about? In addition to changing the types of foods you eat, meal timing and portion size also are important to think about. And that’s not all. Here, bariatric physicians who prescribe these types of medications share the five most common food mistakes to avoid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake No. 1: Not Reducing The Size Of Your Meals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once you start taking a prescription weight loss medication,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.orlandohealth.com/physician-finder/muhammad-ghanem-md#/overview" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" Dr. Muhammad Ghanem," data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.orlandohealth.com/physician-finder/muhammad-ghanem-md#/overview" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt; Dr. Muhammad Ghanem,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;a bariatric surgeon with the Orlando Health Weight Loss and Bariatric Surgery Institute, told HuffPost that it’s best to transition from eating three big meals a day to smaller, more frequent ones. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You know that sleepy feeling that hits you right after a big meal? Ghanem shared that this happens because a big meal causes a surge in blood sugar, which then leads to a surge in insulin to bring blood sugar levels back down (resulting in fatigue). “All these spikes and drops in blood sugar and insulin cause insulin resistance, which causes weight gain. This is why small, frequent meals maintain a more steady blood sugar level, which means less insulin resistance, which means more weight loss,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eehealth.org/find-a-doctor/a/alatassi-diala/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Diala Alatassi," data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.eehealth.org/find-a-doctor/a/alatassi-diala/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Diala Alatassi,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;an obesity medicine physician at Endeavor Health, shared another benefit of frequent, smaller meals — it can reduce unwanted side effects of weight loss medications. “Many weight loss medications slow gastric emptying, making large meals more likely to cause bloating, nausea and discomfort,” she said, adding that this is less likely to happen with smaller, more frequent meals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/doctor/dexter-turnquest/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Dexter Turnquest," data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/doctor/dexter-turnquest/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Dexter Turnquest,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; bariatric medical director at Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital, &lt;span&gt;told HuffPost that another benefit to eating smaller meals throughout the day is that it helps prevent hunger, which is what causes people to make unhealthy food decisions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake No. 2: Not Getting Enough Protein, Fiber And Other Important Nutrients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eating smaller, more frequent meals may lead to less fatigue and unwanted side effects, but Ghanem said that it also can lead to not getting all the required nutrients the body needs. The biggest nutrient deficiency he sees in people taking weight loss medications is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-much-protein-to-eat_l_63a22684e4b0aeb2ace83986" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="protein" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="63a22684e4b0aeb2ace83986" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;protein&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Alatassi added to this, telling HuffPost that not getting enough protein can lead to muscle loss and slow metabolism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But protein isn’t the only nutrient deficiency at risk on a weight loss medication. Obesity medicine specialist and bariatric surgeon &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.doctorkudsi.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Jihad Kudsi" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.doctorkudsi.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Jihad Kudsi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;told HuffPost that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/signs-not-enough-fiber-digestions_l_66ba37afe4b0eabd2393b96d" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="fiber" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="66ba37afe4b0eabd2393b96d" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;fiber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; is another important nutrient many people don’t get enough of. When this happens, he said, it can lead to constipation and negatively impact gut health. Other nutrients Kudsi said many people taking a weight loss medication often don’t get enough of include iron (particularly for women), vitamin B12, calcium and vitamin D.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To ensure you’re getting all the nutrients your body needs, see a registered dietitian to help you figure out the best way to hit all your nutrient buckets while eating frequent smaller meals. Additionally, Turnquest said it can be helpful to take a daily multivitamin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake No. 3: Consuming Too Much Alcohol &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There’s a lot of emphasis on changing food habits after starting to take a weight loss medication, but it’s important to think about your drinking habits too — particularly with alcohol. While drinking alcohol in moderation is OK, Ghanem said, it’s important to avoid drinking too much. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: krisanapong detraphiphat via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;krisanapong detraphiphat via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Alcohol can hinder your body's ability to counteract low blood sugars.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“First, alcohol is a high-calorie drink. Second, alcohol can hinder your body’s ability to counteract low blood sugars. Weight loss medications also lower blood sugars, and this in turn can increase your chances of hypoglycemia, which can be life-threatening. Third, alcohol can cause gastrointestinal disturbances, and the medications do as well. This can aggravate those side effects,” Ghanem said. He also added that people with obesity are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8987457" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="at higher risk for fatty liver disease" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8987457" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;at higher risk for fatty liver disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and routinely drinking too much alcohol can be another blow to liver health, increasing the risk of liver cirrhosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you do decide to consume alcohol, Alatassi told HuffPost, it’s best to limit intake, stay hydrated and to avoid drinking on an empty stomach. This, she said, can decrease the chances of experiencing the negative side effects that are common with weight loss medications, like nausea and dizziness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake No. 4: Skipping Meals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re taking a weight loss medication, you may think that skipping meals can help you get to your goal weight easier. Coupled with the fact that weight loss medications suppress appetite, it can be extra tempting to skip meals. A word of advice straight from the doctors: Don’t. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Skipping meals can lead to unintended side effects and nutritional deficiencies. While these medications suppress appetite, the body still requires consistent nourishment to maintain energy levels, muscle mass and metabolic health,” Kudsi said. He added that prolonged fasting also can lead to overeating later in the day. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alatassi added to this, saying that skipping meals can also increase the risk of muscle loss, which people taking a weight loss medication already are at an increased risk for. “Research has found that skipping meals is linked to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7832851/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="poorer weight loss outcomes" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7832851/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;poorer weight loss outcomes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7788749" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="metabolic imbalances" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7788749" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;&lt;span&gt;metabolic imbalances&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, further reinforcing the need for a structured eating routine,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: eclipse_images via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;eclipse_images via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;A big meal causes a surge in blood sugar, which then leads to a surge in insulin to bring blood sugar levels back down (resulting in fatigue).&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake No. 5: Eating Too Close To Bedtime&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both Kudsi and Turnquest told HuffPost that one common mistake many people taking a weight loss medication make is eating too close to bedtime. “Eating too close to bedtime, especially high-fat or high-carb meals, can worsen acid reflux, which is a common concern for those on GLP-1 medications,” Kudsi said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

This transition isn’t always easy, but you don’t have to figure it out on your own. Talk to your doctor about any struggles you’re having and consider working with a dietitian. Over time, the changes will become your new normal. Until then, don’t be afraid to ask for help.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 11:00:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxOdTZoWXF4V1hMX3ZMZEk3aTFLUlFqZDRONjBQa2pXdHJUTW41Sy1lQXYtTUE0WGpva2pRdWdVV3NwNEtvbXJORHpLV2tHVUxnTlBQMDBIZFRQUFJLZUphcUtKdm9LbHZWYWcyQW1BZmRsejlUS1ozOS13MTI4OUQ4MVFqREtFUdIBiwFBVV95cUxQbGlwbnNZbkpIaWkydzAwNEI2R01Vd1k0MF9Na2hoQUlwYlJmUW5XUUtzWEY0TUtXdHdnSlIza3gwWWN0dGtxME9LSmk1NERfTzJvc2ZLSE02eTRieFMtX285NVRrNmtITnJHYzZOMmxrYk1xUXk5cUhYaTlpc1NiRzI3Sk1aWkxBX2pF</guid></item><item><title>6 Signs You’re Experiencing ‘Accelerated Aging,’ A Major Cancer Contributor - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOMk1nYS1LTkFEQTZfck9JSE5DTHRzRVktUmVqeHFPWmZydUlKNEdmQVF1LV9ZYW12dEYyMXg5MXgxT1ZPTFI4STFBT2ZhdEN2dk5TUTRaZHQzZHNRSTV2V09NbVBuYUxCZGF3NVcwQXZONGpJMjNxR1BQaEMzVXR2Z0hpZ0hGTzBo0gGOAUFVX3lxTFBVWjFBRHA3Nms2WmFEQkQ1VmRQekhEUWRaM0x2LVB2ellXS0pVQTFOTDVvdXlWb2hRZlZfZ0F4UXJRQTFvR1dZMk04M1B6RUNHSEtmTTlnYWtEdDBraXp6UF9ReWZjWEFCWWNEa3RmdF9OTktqN0w2YTdSbFBXUjQyUnpkN1BxMkFzV184V1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s fair to say that &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/aging-gracefully-can-be-scary-but-psychologists-reveal-how-to-shift-your-narrative-ano_l_66f5655ce4b0b663235f6f27" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="aging" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67cf2831e4b0c23ef0b8324a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="66f5655ce4b0b663235f6f27" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/new-years-resolutions-live-longer_l_67644667e4b0e4701452641e" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="longevity" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67cf2831e4b0c23ef0b8324a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="67644667e4b0e4701452641e" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt; are on many people’s minds, especially as they grow older.

Or maybe you got into a driving accident recently? These are examples of cognitive impairment, according to Pandya. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She suggested seeing a healthcare provider ASAP, as an early diagnosis can allow for quick and ongoing medical care and support, plus time to focus on a person’s quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your general functioning abilities are not as great.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could look like struggling to eat, dress yourself or use the bathroom as normal, as well as struggling to shop, take medication and manage finances, according to Pandya. (The first three are basic ADLs, or activities of daily living, and the latter three are IADLs, or instrumental activities of daily living).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Loss of ability in both of these areas may indicate worsening of chronic medical problems, frailty, memory or mental health issues, and need for emotional support,” she said. “Functional decline will in turn lead to undernutrition, falls and inadequate health management.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re hospitalized or in the emergency room more frequently. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can also happen for many reasons, Pandya said, such as becoming more frail, having chronic medical conditions that become harder to manage, and needing more supervision and supportive care — all signs of aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You notice skin changes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age spots (which look like dark patches of skin), &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/so-you-have-wrinkles-but-dont-want-botox-what-are-your-options_l_64f9edb3e4b04eabcd0cc44a" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="wrinkles" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67cf2831e4b0c23ef0b8324a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="64f9edb3e4b04eabcd0cc44a" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="13"&gt;wrinkles&lt;/a&gt;, a loss of skin elasticity and thinning skin can be signs of “normal” or faster aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If these changes are noticeable at an earlier age, these are signs of accelerated aging,” Vercammen said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She recommended staying out of the sun, or wearing &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/best-sunscreen-mature-skin_l_64f7727ee4b0205555fc5995" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="sunscreen for mature skin" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67cf2831e4b0c23ef0b8324a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="64f7727ee4b0205555fc5995" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;sunscreen for mature skin&lt;/a&gt; and adequate clothing if you do get out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: SDI Productions via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;SDI Productions via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Don't ignore the signs of accelerated aging.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Accelerated Aging Can Increase Cancer Risk &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aging takes a toll on the body; the body struggles to heal as efficiently and effectively.

Vaccines also work by reducing the severity of illness – and, in some cases, can prevent death – should people catch the sickness they were immunized against.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Daisy Hildebrand died last week at University medical center in Lubbock, Texas, about 80 miles (129km) away from her family’s home in the rural community of Seminole. Her doctors attributed her death to what they described as “measles pulmonary failure”, noting that she was not MMR-vaccinated and had no reported underlying conditions, according to &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; from Texas’s state health services department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She was the second young child from Seminole to die from measles in about five weeks. Kayley Fehr, who was also not given the MMR vaccine, died aged six in February after contracting measles and being hospitalized in Lubbock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;An unvaccinated adult in Lea county, New Mexico, also died after contracting the measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Fehr was the first person in the US to die from measles since 2015. Measles had been declared eliminated from the US in 2000, but it has recently been spreading in undervaccinated communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Funeral services for Hildebrand and Fehr were held in the same Mennonite church in Seminole, which has a population of about 7,000, according to publicly available information. Many Mennonite communities – which tend to be close-knit – have historically been undervaccinated as they &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;prioritize&lt;/a&gt; what they interpret to be medical freedom over vaccine mandates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Children who get the MMR vaccine are typically given the first dose at 12-15 months. They usually get the second dose between ages four and six.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Respectively, the shots are 93% and 97% effective, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fmmr%2Fpublic%2Findex.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the US Centers for Diseases Control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The west &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; county to which Seminole belongs, Gaines, has one of the highest vaccine exemption rates in the state. Around the time of Hildebrand’s death, it had reported about 300 measles cases since January. That was more than 65% of the nearly 500 measles cases which had then been reported in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As of Friday, the US government was reporting more than 605 measles cases across 22 states for the year so far.

Pictured: Scientists walk over the thawing Greenland icecap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;So-called 'Methuselah microbes' can remain dormant in the soil and the bodies of frozen animals for tens of thousands of years. Scientists have managed to revive some of these ancient diseases in the lab, including this Pithovirus sibericum that was isolated from a 30,000-year-old sample of permafrost &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Glaciers can also store huge numbers of frozen viruses. As scientists predict that the world's glaciers will vanish by 2100, there are concerns that these ancient pathogens could be released &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For over a decade, scientists known that bacteria and viruses frozen in the Arctic could still have the potential to infect living organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2014, scientists isolated viruses from the Siberian permafrost &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/article-6923367/Thawing-Siberian-permafrost-anthrax-prehistoric-diseases-come-life.html"&gt;and showed they could still infect living cells despite being frozen for thousands of years.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, in 2023, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-12988837/Arctic-zombie-viruses-Siberia-one-day-released-Earths-warming-climate-trigger-new-pandemic-scientists-warn.html"&gt;scientists successfully revived an amoeba virus that had been frozen for 48,500 years.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the risks are not limited to permafrost regions, as dormant pathogens can also be found in large bodies of ice such as glaciers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year,&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-13793979/ancient-viruses-discovered-melting-ice.html"&gt; scientists found 1,700 ancient viruses lurking deep inside a glacier &lt;/a&gt;in western China, most of which have never been seen before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The viruses date back as far as 41,000 years and have survived three major shifts from cold to warm climates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While these viruses are safe so long as they remain buried in the permafrost, the big concern for climate scientists is that they may not remain that way for long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When ice or permafrost is disturbed or melts, any microbes inside are released into the environment - many of which could be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The bodies of frozen animals like mammoths or woolly rhinoceros (pictured) can harbour ancient organisms which survive in a dormant state.

If this happened, there is a serious risk of humans becoming infected by the ancient disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Arctic is an especially dangerous region for zoonotic diseases because health monitoring services are so limited. The researchers point out that diseases like Toxoplasma gondii are already spreading widely through people and animals in the region (illustrated)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This type of infection could lead to a particularly dangerous and hard-to-control pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Abbas says: 'Climate change and pollution are affecting both animal and human health—our research looked into how these two forces are interconnected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As the Arctic warms faster than most other parts of the world, we're seeing changes in the environment—like melting permafrost and shifting ecosystems—that could help spread infectious diseases between animals and people.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers warn that Arctic regions are an especially dangerous starting point for a pandemic since the region has so little medical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health and research services are limited, meaning a disease may spread widely before the authorities have the chance to react.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Already, the researchers point out that zoonotic diseases such as Hantavirus hemorrhagic fever and the parasite Toxoplasma gondii have spread throughout the Arctic region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dr Abbas cautions that what is happening in the Arctic 'doesn't stay in the Arctic'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The environmental stressors we studied have ripple effects that reach far beyond the polar regions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;mol-permabox id="mol-982c9580-1460-11f0-ac9b-817996f0a7ca"&gt;&lt;div class=" mol-factbox sciencetech art-ins" data-version="2" id="mol-92da8620-0c28-11e8-9ae0-6f3a2e2268ae" data-permabox-url="/sciencetech/fb-5363711/WHAT-PERMAFROST.html"&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Permafrost is a permanently frozen layer below the Earth's surface found in Arctic regions such as Alaska, Siberia and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It typically consists of soil, gravel and sand bound together by ice, and is classified as ground that has remained below 0°C (32°F) for at least two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is estimated 1,500 billion tons of carbon is stored in the world's permafrost - more than twice the amount found in the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The carbon comes in the form of ancient vegetation and soil that has remained frozen for millennia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If global warming were to melt the world's permafrost, it could release thousands of tonnes of carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because some permafrost regions have stayed frozen for thousands of years, it is of particular interest for scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ancient remains found in permafrost are among the most complete ever found because the ice stops organic matter from decomposing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A number of 2,500-year-old bodies buried in Siberia by a group of nomads known as the Scythians have been found with their tattooed skin still intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A baby mammoth corpse uncovered on Russia's Arctic coast in 2010 still sported clumps of its hair despite being more than 39,000 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Permafrost is also used in the study of Earth's geological history as soil and minerals buried deep in Arctic regions for thousands of years can be dug up and studied today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/mol-permabox&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 10:53:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQRlI4MjFrNEN1czVyNER6RTZpTnJUNG1pTlNXRGVfTk9kc3RCX2R3MzFpRlBuYUMtZFJyekZqTjlNcXNCR3BXVElTYThheXF0NFh3UjQxQnhNMU81NGQzbEx5Xy1Od3RDZlE2bHhJR3hKdGk1X08zZzlocHhvQlQ4alYwN3dfcFB5cWN0VU5TVHhWRWpRQkJDMms2Z9IBoAFBVV95cUxNUDQxNlZXbVo4ejJuR1ZwaEFxektaTXNyMHVvb1pLeVRScVdlVWpObnozUWJ0N2tKMnJBTEg0WVRDdlJHMUZqUXJrQVVObTlHcXQxV3VhbVZ4cDBjdEVxQk9Mb3EySV81eFMycEJuckM3ZlV1NUIxUnhoeEhfRFdWX3FONG1IQWN6ZHdxSVFDeDZkci1iaXpobXpvSzZGalJz</guid></item></channel></rss>
