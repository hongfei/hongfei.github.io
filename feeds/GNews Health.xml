It affects not only individuals but also deeply impacts caregivers and families, often creating emotional, financial, and logistical challenges over time. In its early stages, it might look like simple forgetfulness. But over time, it can take away even the most basic abilities, like recognising loved ones or getting dressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most symptoms begin after age 65, but the condition starts developing in the brain years, sometimes even decades, before that. As life expectancy rises, so does the number of people affected. Over 6 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9502739/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;million &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;older adults in the U.S. live with Alzheimer’s, and that number is expected to grow dramatically. This makes prevention even more important. Growing research shows that our lifestyle choices; what we eat, how we sleep, and how we move, can make a real difference in protecting brain health long before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What causes Alzheimer’s disease? Key risk factors to know&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease doesn’t have a single known cause. Instead, it likely develops from a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that damage the brain over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Age is the biggest risk factor. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/what-causes-alzheimers-disease" data-type="tilCustomLink"&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/a&gt;, the risk of Alzheimer’s doubles every five years after age 65. Ageing is linked to the buildup of abnormal proteins like beta-amyloid plaques and tangles in the brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Genetics and family history also play a role. People with a parent or sibling with Alzheimer’s are at higher risk. In particular, carrying the APOE ε4 gene variant has been linked to late-onset Alzheimer’s, but it doesn’t guarantee you’ll develop the disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI), especially repeated or severe head injuries, may trigger long-term brain changes that increase Alzheimer’s risk later in life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart and vascular health matters, too. High blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, and heart disease can all impair blood flow to the brain, accelerating damage. Managing these conditions may reduce dementia risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mental health is another factor. Chronic stress and depression have been linked to changes in brain structure and function, especially in memory-related areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smoking and toxin exposure can raise the risk by increasing oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain. Quitting smoking at any age can help lower this risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other contributing factors include low education levels, social isolation, and unhealthy lifestyle habits like poor diet or inactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having these risk factors doesn’t mean you’ll develop Alzheimer’s, but they can increase your chances. Many of them, especially lifestyle-related ones, are preventable or manageable through early action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Recognising the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While occasional forgetfulness is a normal part of ageing, Alzheimer’s disease involves ongoing cognitive and behavioural decline that interferes with daily life. These changes typically worsen over time as brain cells are progressively damaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/10_signs" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; and the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-symptoms-and-diagnosis/what-are-signs-alzheimers-disease" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, early signs include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Memory loss that disrupts daily routines, such as forgetting recent conversations or appointments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty completing familiar tasks, like using appliances or managing bills.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Problem-solving challenges, including trouble planning or following steps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Language issues, such as struggling to find the right words or follow conversations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disorientation, with confusion about time or location.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poor judgment, including neglecting hygiene or falling for scams.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mood and personality changes, such as irritability, anxiety, or social withdrawal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These symptoms don’t always indicate Alzheimer’s; they can result from other conditions like depression or medication side effects. A medical diagnosis is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In later stages, people may lose the ability to communicate, walk, or care for themselves. Research shows that early detection and intervention can improve quality of life and slow disease progression. If signs appear, consult a healthcare professional promptly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;11 lifestyle changes that could help prevent Alzheimer’s&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s often begins to develop decades before symptoms appear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/abstract" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;now shows that up to 45% of dementia cases could be delayed or prevented by addressing modifiable lifestyle factors throughout life. Here’s how targeting key areas can help protect your brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Improve blood flow&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy blood flow supplies the brain with oxygen and nutrients. Studies show that reduced cerebral blood flow is linked to Alzheimer’s and mild cognitive impairment. Promising evidence from &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/newsroom/articles/year-2020/exercise-improves-memory-boosts-blood-flow-to-brain.html?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;UT Southwestern&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; demonstrated that older adults with memory issues who engaged in one year of regular aerobic exercise experienced a nearly 47% increase in blood flow to memory-related brain regions and improved cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Stay mentally active as you age&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building what’s known as “cognitive reserve” helps delay dementia symptoms by strengthening neural networks through lifelong learning and activity. Research from Alzheimer’s Research UK shows that engaging in new, mentally challenging activities throughout life lowers the risk of dementia by up to 30%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reduce inflammation&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation is a known factor in neurodegeneration. Diseases like gum inflammation contribute to increased dementia risk. A nutrient-rich, anti-inflammatory lifestyle, focused on whole foods, regular exercise, stress control, and good oral hygiene, helps protect the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Recognize genetic risk but take action&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrying the APOE-ε4 gene increases Alzheimer’s risk, but lifestyle still matters. The &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/abstract" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Lancet Commission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; reports that even those with high genetic risk can significantly reduce dementia risk through healthy habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Avoid head trauma&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Head injuries can increase the risk of dementia later in life. Simple preventive steps, like wearing helmets during sports, using seat belts, and avoiding risky behaviors like texting while driving, can help protect brain health long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Minimize exposure to toxins&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic exposure to environmental toxins such as heavy metals, air pollution, alcohol, and certain medications affects cognitive health. Reducing exposure, eating detox-supportive foods, staying hydrated, and using tools like saunas can help reduce toxic burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Prioritize mental health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression, stress, and anxiety are associated with brain changes and increased dementia risk. Approaches such as therapy, mindfulness, journaling, or meditation can support mental wellbeing and protect cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support immunity&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic illnesses that impair immunity (e.g., infections, autoimmune diseases) can accelerate brain aging. Ensuring good vitamin D levels, a balanced diet, and routine healthcare helps strengthen immune defenses that support brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Balance hormones&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="91"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormones like thyroid, estrogen, and testosterone affect memory and mood. Age-related hormone declines can influence cognition. Regular hormone screenings allow early detection and intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="93"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Avoid “diabesity”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="95"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining obesity and type 2 diabetes, “diabesity” is strongly linked to dementia. Losing weight, managing blood sugar, and lowering systemic inflammation are key to reducing cognitive decline risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="97"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="98"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ensure quality sleep&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="99"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep clears beta-amyloid and supports cognitive processing at night. Even one night of sleep deprivation can raise amyloid levels by 5%, while chronic poor sleep disrupts the toxin-cleaning “glymphatic” system and elevates Alzheimer’s risk. For optimal brain health, aim for 7–8 hours of restorative sleep nightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="101"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/curry-leaves-10-powerful-health-benefits-medicinal-uses-and-how-to-consume-them/articleshow/122575062.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Curry Leaves: 10 powerful health benefits, medicinal uses and how to consume them&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="104"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="105"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 04:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAJBVV95cUxQOFlUYjNLeTRzM0lmMHdtWTByRk5keWlaT19HZ195RTdGNGFuNUV0WFE0bEI5aTNYOVdFdmpsUmgteG1ISWFkVUdJaUIwek16Q2E1NWF0UlREek1QdWtaM1UwUWkxZ3F2ZG5GMGc1Y0tWZHo3eldrdnVmYXpkdVFrUjA2bU5sdFE1cXJuZkUzSUktZnBtdDBBYjZET08xMXNnZGxaWGJmM3FCbFQ4cXFONmVUTTRRR2V1X01vS3hYYjdUT0lBQ09IUUxfSllIVkpzc2U1OXVXMmh0WXZFRnVDVENnYk0wWFRrYmtJUDE4NGFWYVg5cGZKY1QzLVpteEhON002ZlVBb0kxUndjNGZlZWkxYjVIQzJ4dkx4cA</guid></item><item><title>日式散步、蛋白质提示和野火烟雾：健康与幸福的一周-《华盛顿邮报》 | Japanese walking, protein tips and wildfire smoke: The week in Well+Being - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxOajhBVlBjU3NLRTBNY21yZlZwaEh3VWVTUV9MS24yd05nOXRrSzZqQUpjSFBUSVZ2OUxYWk0tdWF2VTFUbURqb2EzRW45NjZFZ2thQzBkMG5NNmpfNnVKdndjQUtFU29scDl1RVV1am1vdzB0SXBna05IT1Exa2lxQTZJLXI2RFVpa2ZsMlozUTBCd3hpd1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UGQCTEK54VG6ZJMDUHNQ4TH7XI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;You’re reading our weekly Well+Being newsletter. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/well-being/?method=SURL&amp;amp;location=ART&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sign up here&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; to get it delivered to your inbox every Thursday.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M265R3MXQVEFLA342IC4J2ZXYY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Have you taken a walk today? Here at Well + Being, we’re excited about a “new” walking technique that’s actually been around for decades. And it’s worth rediscovering. As you know, exercise is so important for health and longevity, but it’s not always convenient or easy to schedule. That’s why we love to hear about workouts that maximize the benefits — better mood, sleep, muscle strength and blood pressure, anyone?— and doesn’t take &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; long. This one, called “Japanese walking” can be done in just 30 minutes a day. And as an added bonus, summer can be the perfect time to take a walk in nature (which has its own mental health benefits) while also hitting your exercise goals. We’ve even scheduled a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/07/22/japanese-walking-questions-answers/" target="_blank"&gt;Live Chat on Tuesday at noon Eastern&lt;/a&gt; to answer your questions about how to use walking to get in shape.

One particular technique, known as interval walking training (IWT) or “Japanese walking,” is getting renewed attention after going viral on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ORKFK5FQYRH4FNN7F6XGKASSSQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In a 2007 study, volunteers did three minutes of fast walking followed by three minutes at a slower pace, for 30 minutes per day at least four days per week. “One of the most surprising findings was that IWT markedly increased physical fitness and decreased blood pressure after the 5-month intervention whereas these improvements were not observed in the moderate-intensity continuous walking group,” Shizue Masuki, a researcher on the team and professor at Shinshu University Graduate School of Medicine in Matsumoto, told our reporter, Alexandra Frost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="QD6CIJTJLNBUXMPBUEGLPULFHY" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="QD6CIJTJLNBUXMPBUEGLPULFHY" data-testid="article-header"&gt;You might be fooling yourself about peanut butter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TOA62XB73VFNRLIZ3SWLXK35GE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Optimizing your protein intake can be tricky. It’s not just &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/05/24/protein-weight-loss-muscle-facts/" target="_blank"&gt;how much protein&lt;/a&gt; you eat that matters, but when you eat it, and the foods that you get it from. You may even have higher protein needs than you think depending on your overall health, your age, your activity levels and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RXY3DJDFUZG33NU46LVFUVT2MQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Nutrition reporter Anahad O’Connor spoke to experts and analyzed studies to identify the most common protein pitfalls. For example, you have probably heard that peanut butter has a lot of protein. But in reality, it’s a better source of fat than protein, said Jose Antonio, a professor of health and human performance at Nova Southeastern University in Florida. “The fat is good for you. But don’t fool yourself into thinking that you’re getting a lot of high-quality protein.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YELXDYSLY5GE7IOUBO54HS23KM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To find out more about the mistakes that people make when it comes to eating protein, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/07/16/protein-how-much-do-i-need/" target="_blank"&gt;read our story here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="GQU2LZM3U5BLHBP4ISI3JZU52I" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="GQU2LZM3U5BLHBP4ISI3JZU52I" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What I eat in a day to boost my gut health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7GISK2JFOJDPXFRCUDOHSFGQ5E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our Ask a Doctor columnist is Trisha S.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Glioblastomas can be diagnosed at any age and are particularly difficult to treat because the tumors can grow tentacles deep into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 12,000 people are diagnosed with the disease every year, and only five percent of them survive longer than five years, estimates suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases are rising, experts say, including a slight uptick among those under 40 years old, but physicians are stumped as to the cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Newman went to his primary care doctor, and then the emergency room after his wife Joanna, who works in a physician's office, recommended that he got checked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Branden had a migraine for six days,' she told local news station &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.kcentv.com/article/news/local/overcome-this-salado-couples-love-story-becomes-battle-against-rare-brain-cancer/500-b3daed9d-9b07-45fe-9783-54ee8de855ad"&gt;KCENTV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He's always had migraines, but this one was different because it lasted so long and he was nauseous and the light really bothered him.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Revealing the moment she found out the diagnosis, she said: 'My boss came and got me out of the [operating room] and told me that they found a mass on Branden and I lost it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was diagnosed with a 'mass' on May 2, and underwent a craniotomy to remove it on May 8, a surgery where doctors cut open the skull to access the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;To treat the cancer, doctors opened his skull and removed 90 percent of the tumor from his brain. The above photo is from after the surgery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He has endured radiation for six weeks followed by weekly chemotherapy for six months to eliminate the tumor cells, and is now undergoing daily chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Newman is also taking perampanel, an anti-seizure medication that can have anti-tumor effects, and gabapentin, also an anti-seizure drug that has been linked to improved survival among people with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors said that during the surgery, they tried to remove the tumor from around his middle cerebral artery,&lt;span&gt; one of the three major arteries that supply blood to the brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But during the procedure, the blood vessel spasmed, causing a stroke and damage to the brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was initially unable to move his left side after waking up from surgery but has now recovered enough movement to walk again. He is still having trouble with his left arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Newman revealed his diagnosis amid Glioblastoma Awareness Day on July 16, which aims to make more people aware of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Warning signs of the disease include a persistent headache, vomiting, loss of appetite, double vision and changes in mood and personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors say the overwhelming majority of headaches do not represent tumors, but those who are concerned should speak to their primary care providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The pair, from Texas, are childhood sweethearts having met in 2000 when Branden was 13 years old and she was just 11 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Newman and his wife were childhood sweethearts, having met when he was 13 and she was just 11 years old while on a camping trip. The pair dated in high school and married in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But shortly after the wedding, the pair faced a crisis when Newman's wife was unexpectedly diagnosed with a non-cancerous spinal cord tumor that left her struggling to walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Newman stuck by her and supported her through the surgery and the recovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His wife said: 'Branden stuck by me through all of that, even at such a young age and facing life with potentially having your wife in a wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He took great care of me all the way through. I am so grateful. He's such a good man.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is now looking after Newman and helping to support him while he battles his diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pair has also launched a fundraiser to help cover hospital and emergency bills triggered by battling the disease. It has already raised $140,000 out of its $35,000 goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 19:38:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>亚当斯县2人感染西尼罗河病毒- KUSA.com | 2 people in Adams County infected with West Nile Virus - KUSA.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxNWTJxaWY1YVlmMGt0amlXV1pkN3V2OXFUWm81QnVKdDE4bXcwb19RM3pHNFQ2MVVNRjlsQ1FCOEdGVkJnWmljSGhIU3F5dGJ0dHAtLVVYeU9SeFFyTHhVckVuX0t5aDlWTk9rX2RkX1ZaaXVacF9SY2M3YlZ6NG9ZbmdZa2tiN2ZwZ1Rwd0Q4RVVhQUx3TnJzc0FBRTVwcHZLVi0yT1dOY1VnZU5YaXc4MC0ydUZrRmFDLXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

People infected &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-7471039/Toddler-diagnosed-case-drug-resistant-typhoid-trip-Pakistan.html"&gt;with resistant typhoid&lt;/a&gt; carry it to new countries, while the global food trade spreads resistant bacteria to dense cities with poor sanitation accelerates the spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers warned that the most commonly used antibiotics, including Ampicillin, Chloramphenicol, and Azithromycin, may not save patients’ lives like they used to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Approximately 5,700 Americans become ill each year, and 620 are hospitalized. Deaths from typhoid fever in the US are very infrequent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jason Andrews, a specialist in infectious diseases at Stanford University and lead author of the report, said the breakneck pace at which S. Typhi is spreading ‘is a real cause for concern.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typhoid fever sickens 11million people every year, causing fever, abdominal pain, and, if left untreated, intestinal bleeding and &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/sepsis/index.html" id="mol-d4cb4440-632b-11f0-970a-09a9b27031ec"&gt;sepsis&lt;/a&gt;. It kills about 100,000 people annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Our study found resistant typhoid crossed borders 197 times since 1990 - mostly within South Asia, and spreading to Africa and beyond&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around one in five people who are not treated for typhoid will die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the genes of a strain of bacteria mutate to resist antibiotics, doctors have far fewer treatment options when patients present with typhoid symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers analyzed the genetics of over 7,600 samples of S. Typhi, including 3,489 samples from individuals with typhoid in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan from 2014 to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also looked at 4,169 older samples from more than 70 countries, some dating back to 1905. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They pored over the bacteria’s genetic blueprint to identify genes that can change the bacterial protein that antibiotics usually attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This causes the bacteria to make enzymes that break down the drug, eject antibiotics before they work, or use alternative biochemical pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team warned that typhoid-causing bacteria are mutating so rapidly that modern medicine can’t keep up, stating that by the time scientists decide to use vaccines based on today's resistance data, it may already be too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;South Asia is a hotspot where resistance continues to develop and then spreads globally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Approximately 5,700 Americans become ill each year, and 620 are hospitalized. Deaths from typhoid fever in the US are very infrequent (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since 1990, strains resistant to the antibiotic class quinolones have evolved independently at least 94 times, with 97 percent of these cases originating in South Asia, specifically in countries such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What began as localized resistance, affecting 85 percent of Bangladeshi typhoid cases by the early 2000s, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-5618227/First-known-epidemic-drug-resistant-typhoid-spreading-Pakistan.html"&gt;exploded across the region&lt;/a&gt;, surpassing a 95 percent prevalence in India, Pakistan, and Nepal within a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pattern repeats with newer drugs. Azithromycin resistance has emerged seven times since 2003, with Bangladeshi strains steadily proliferating since 2013, while resistance to last-line antibiotics cephalosporins now looms as the next frontier in the escalating crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While these strains most often occur within South Asia and spread from there to Southeast Asia, East Africa, and Southern Africa, they have also been reported in the US, UK and Canada. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Andrew said: ‘The fact resistant strains of S. Typhi have spread internationally so many times also underscores the need to view typhoid control, and antibiotic resistance more generally, as a global rather than local problem.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research was published in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(22)00093-3/fulltext"&gt;The Lancet Microbe&lt;/a&gt; journal.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typhoid is rare in the US, and cases typically arise after a person has traveled internationally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It primarily affects people in areas with poor sanitation, and children under five are more susceptible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2018, a Massachusetts daycare center temporarily closed after a child &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-5715271/Child-diagnosed-typhoid-fever-Massachusetts-daycare.html"&gt;was diagnosed with typhoid&lt;/a&gt;, likely contracted during recent international travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typhoid fever spreads through fecal-oral transmission, meaning people ingest the bacteria Salmonella Typhi from food, water, or surfaces that have come in contact with fecal matter, such as eating food handled by someone with typhoid who didn’t wash their hands after using the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study has some gaps that need to be considered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers lacked sufficient genetic data from key regions, particularly parts of Africa and Oceania, where typhoid is prevalent. Without more samples from these areas, it is more difficult to track how and when resistant strains spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even in countries with better monitoring, most samples are collected from just a few locations, which may not accurately reflect what is happening elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And since only a small fraction of typhoid cases get genetically tested, the true scale of antibiotic resistance and global spread is probably even worse than the numbers show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said THIS highlights the need ‘to expand genomic surveillance to provide a more comprehensive window into the emergence, expansion, and spread of antibiotic-resistant organisms.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 18:08:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>使用David Baker的新人工智能技术，无法治疗的“无序”蛋白质变得可以吸毒- STAT | Undruggable ‘disordered’ proteins become druggable with new AI techniques from David Baker - STAT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxON2l2X01jNmVDb3pmNGVNN3JNTWtVQW43VS1rY0xtZ3hYaXV1Qkc2YW1vZzA2TWdRMHY3cG5kM2xLQ3h6clhwU0w0NGtTT1RkU25JUU5VTmJkN01jVC1mWjY0WXZ0clRGMC1ObmtPVTdMbWNIWTRKTEliems3N3h1a3N2QkkzbTM3RmhyeFV2WFBnTWtlWFo1LVpmbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, structural biologists shoved what looked like shoddy data in the back of their closets, embarrassed. While attempting to gather the structures of proteins, they would sometimes find that all or at least a portion of the protein would just not show up correctly in the data. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Joel Sussman, a former head of the Protein Data Bank, remembers when he found his first intrinsically disordered protein, though it wasn’t called that at the time. He showed it to a collaborator. “‘Oh, Joel, you’re not a very good biochemist. Obviously, it has a structure and you’re confused,’” he recalled her saying.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most proteins fold into shapes with distinct elements: the ordered spiral of an alpha-helix, like a piece of cavatappi pasta; or beta sheets, like a slice of a lasagna — squiggly lines of pasta amino acids held parallel to each other with cheesy and saucy hydrogen bonds. A central tenet of structural biology is that a protein’s structure dictates its function. But &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S003169972411616X" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;around the same time&lt;/a&gt; that the world was preparing for Y2K, structural biologists finally began admitting that — just as Sussman and other scientists had seen — not all proteins have a permanent shape. A surprisingly large amount of important proteins (in fact, over &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cr400713r" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;half of all proteins in eukaryotes&lt;/a&gt;, it’s estimated) have strands of wiggly “spaghetti” in them. &lt;/p&gt;

While tau proteins twist together in fiber-like strands called tangles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The plaques and tangles block the ability of the brain's neurons to send electrical and chemical signals back and forth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, this disruption causes permanent damage in the brain that leads to Alzheimer's disease and dementia, causing patients to lose their ability to speak, care for themselves or even respond to the world around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;About 7million people in the US 65 and older live with the condition and over 100,00 die from it annually. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Leading health experts recommend taking 5,000 IU of vitamin D3 - priced at 20 cents per capsule or $17.99 for 90 - every day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Alzheimer's Association estimates that by 2050, nearly 13 million Americans will be living with the disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there is no clear cause of the Alzheimer's disease, experts believe it can develop due to genetic mutations and lifestyle choices, such as physical inactivity, unhealthy diet and social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additional studies have also shown that Vitamin D &lt;span&gt;provides protection to the brain cells, regulates nerve growth as well as genes important for brain function.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically, the body makes vitamin D from direct sunlight on the skin or absorbs it from foods such as milk, egg yolks, beef liver, mushrooms and fatty fishes like salmon and mackerel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts suggest that having a vitamin D level of 20 nanograms/ milliliter (mg/ml) in the blood or higher is adequate for good bone health and anything below 20ng/ml is considered a deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But despite the critical role it plays, nearly 40 percent of adults are Vitamin D deficient, meaning they are more likely to develop conditions such as osteoporosis (fragile bones), heart problems and Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, it also aids the function of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin, which play vital roles in overall mood, cognition and behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Therefore, a deficiency can damage the cell and nerve growth process in the brain which can cause a decline in cognitive abilities, including executive functions like paying attention and processing information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brain cell and nerve damage can also contribute to problems in the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for memory formation, which in turn can impair communication between brain regions as well as the brain and rest of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Taking regular Vitamin D supplements can help protect brain cells,contribute to brain development and maintain cognitive function&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin D deficiency can manifest in symptoms similar to depression, such as low mood, fatigue and loss of interest in activities - all of which are major contributors to the development of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, taking regular vitamin D supplements can help maintain healthy levels of the vitamin in the body which can help protection brain cells, contribute to brain development and maintain cognitive function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin D supplements can also help reduce oxidative stress in the brain, described as an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in the body that leads to cell damage and various neurological conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, Vitamin D has anti-inflammatory properties that can help slow down cognitive decline in older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Apart from capsules, Vitamin D levels in the blood can also be increased by eating consuming foods such as fatty fish and milk while also spending more time in the sun. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But there’s also some DNA outside of the cell’s nucleus, in structures called mitochondria. Dangerous mutations there can cause a range of diseases in children that can lead to muscle weakness, seizures, developmental delays, major organ failure and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-093ea3" class="body-graf"&gt;Testing during the in vitro fertilization process can usually identify whether these mutations are present. But in rare cases, it’s not clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dcbca7" class="body-graf"&gt;Researchers have been developing a technique that tries to avoid the problem by using the healthy mitochondria from a donor egg. They reported in 2023 that the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/britain-genetic-babies-mitochondria-three-parent-6d826809d66a4474bc9dc455c475ad58"&gt;first babies&lt;/a&gt; had been born using this method, where scientists take genetic material from the mother’s egg or embryo, which is then transferred into a donor egg or embryo that has healthy mitochondria but the rest of its key DNA removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6868f3" class="body-graf"&gt;The latest research “marks an important milestone,” said Dr. Zev Williams, who directs the Columbia University Fertility Center and was not involved in the work. “Expanding the range of reproductive options … will empower more couples to pursue safe and healthy pregnancies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d8adb7" class="body-graf"&gt;Using this method means the embryo has &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/baby-born-using-three-parent-technique-doctors-say-n655701" target="_blank"&gt;DNA from three people&lt;/a&gt; — from the mother’s egg, the father’s sperm and the donor’s mitochondria — and it required a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-parenting-relationships-69d7ed6e2c6b4072b0e3d036ecb939a3"&gt;2016 U.K. law change&lt;/a&gt; to approve it. It is also allowed in Australia but not in many other countries, including the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-45021d" class="body-graf"&gt;Experts at Britain’s Newcastle University and Monash University in Australia reported in the New England Journal of Medicine Wednesday that they performed the new technique in fertilized embryos from 22 patients, which resulted in eight babies that appear to be free of mitochondrial diseases.

The genetic material from the donated egg makes up less than 1% of the baby born by using this technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-942dcb" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you had a bone marrow transplant from a donor … you will have much more DNA from another person,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-51b907" class="body-graf"&gt;In the U.K., every couple seeking a baby born through donated mitochondria must be approved by the country’s fertility regulator. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6216f2" class="body-graf"&gt;Critics have previously raised concerns, warning that it’s impossible to know the impact these sorts of novel techniques might have on future generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4a02cf" class="body-graf"&gt;“Currently, pronuclear transfer is not permitted for clinical use in the U.S., largely due to regulatory restrictions on techniques that result in heritable changes to the embryo,” Williams, of Columbia, said in an email. ”Whether that will change remains uncertain and will depend on evolving scientific, ethical, and policy discussions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a75c76" class="body-graf"&gt;For about a decade, Congress has included provisions in annual funding bills banning the Food and Drug Administration from accepting applications for clinical research involving techniques, “in which a human embryo is intentionally created or modified to include a heritable genetic modification.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9fc6b6" class="body-graf"&gt;But in countries where the technique is allowed, advocates say it could provide a promising alternative for some families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-230b1d" class="body-graf"&gt;Liz Curtis, whose daughter Lily died of a mitochondrial disease in 2006, now works with other families affected by them. She said it was devastating to be told there was no treatment for her eight-month-old baby and that death was inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fcc33d" class="body-graf"&gt;She said the diagnosis “turned our world upside down, and yet nobody could tell us very much about it, what it was or how it was going to affect Lily.” Curtis later founded the Lily Foundation in her daughter’s name to raise awareness and support research into the disease, including the latest work done at Newcastle University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-47af43" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s super exciting for families that don’t have much hope in their lives,” Curtis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-569a09" class="body-graf"&gt;The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, the UK’s fertility regulator, welcomed the findings, adding that the technique would legally only be available to those at very high risk of passing the disease onto their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e93a7a" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;As of this month, 35 patients have been authorized to undergo the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 17:22:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxPR3pBY2FWTVd1eS1sRGEyYUdYUy1XcnBmOUJrZVZSWVB2X2hpQW5SeXlqRFFiTkZQcWpFN1FiNkYtSU9RWXprd1ZMZDFYWHdmSTloNEsyN1ZuVExCQThCMHB2WGtUdXk0RXJzaV9XUGpuR09iNVAyM3VvQ2ZHWGFMVmpyNllzbzhsdHhlaVAzaXZ6UUhnSmUtM1R6WDd3Q0ZMZTRMNG1fSUZPSlpESy1BVFdocWZMWHlw0gFWQVVfeXFMTTF0UkdRcnZEbllDOHFwZVdDRWlTd2JoOEt0UXlHVDVaY1JodU5KTXlLU1cyVldmQXo4SkpaZkhMMXpYVUNuaEZwRTZyVGRtbUY0UzFpa0E</guid></item><item><title>根据专家的说法，这些是老年人最好的6种维生素和矿物质- CNET | These Are the 6 Best Vitamins and Minerals for Older Adults, According to Experts - CNET</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxNbzdzcDR6cFFyVWpXTzEwbHB4X0F1S3hpU3RZejhqOGxSdUhYR281SDRjUURXSVJfZXdMODRra29QYllfVGlOWXNWSWNYc0lodUl3bXUwU2VwQ1NEaTlybnpiWEpHcU1Ma3pnZ2ZKMl9LNS11NlBmU0dHQXZaWmp2eHlENTRGMkUyaVN2Zw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p1"&gt;Getting a good selection of vitamins and minerals in your diet is vital to staying fit and healthy, and that shouldn't be a shock to anyone at this point.

Vitamin B-12 works with folate to help your body make new cells, including blood cells and nerve cells.

Brukner said this is because "stomachs make less acid, and this acid is necessary to take the vitamin from food into the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teitelbaum said B vitamins are critical for energy production, and suboptimal levels can affect your health. He warns that B vitamin deficiency has been associated with "a &lt;a data-id="62a38b00-866c-4718-bb35-e93cd6b25a9e" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8079632/#s5" target="_self"&gt;marked increase of dementia&lt;/a&gt; (especially folic acid) and &lt;a data-id="62a38b00-866c-4718-bb35-e93cd6b25a9e" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749379715000732" target="_self"&gt;increased risk of heart attack and stroke&lt;/a&gt; (especially in those with elevated homocysteine levels)."

Brukner said that if you don't eat these foods, you may want to turn to foods like cereals and nutritional yeast with added B12. "Older people, especially those having certain stomach issues or taking medicine that lowers stomach acid, might need to take a B12 vitamin supplement," he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-id="4bcc0d6a-5e1b-4506-a312-ccce96fb8e02" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amelia-ti/" target="_self"&gt;Amelia Ti&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and diabetes educator in New York, who is also part of &lt;a data-id="4bcc0d6a-5e1b-4506-a312-ccce96fb8e02" href="https://www.cnet.com/health/how-we-ensure-accurate-and-reliable-medical-information/" target="_self"&gt;CNET's Medical Review Board&lt;/a&gt;, adds that people taking medicine that blocks B12 absorption, like omeprazole or metformin, may also need a vitamin B12 supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="63b88bbd-7786-4e03-b50d-6188e59d0f33" data-ng-block="{"&gt;3.

"As people become older, their bodies take in less calcium from food, which can cause bones to become weaker." You can get calcium naturally from sources like milk, yogurt and cheese. The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health notes that &lt;a data-id="1d793e1a-5f90-4577-b87d-c7245b6c97c1" href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/calcium/" target="_self"&gt;calcium is also available&lt;/a&gt; in kale, salmon, tofu, almonds and spinach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for supplements, Brukner said, "If you are at risk for bone troubles or don't get enough calcium in your food, taking supplements might be useful. But too much calcium can cause other issues like kidney stones, so talk with your doctor first."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="25116308-079a-460a-8a1f-260f30b79b1c" data-ng-block="{"&gt;4.

Ti adds that omega-3s help lessen swelling by reducing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty fish like salmon are a good source of omega-3 fatty acids. Brukner said you can also turn to flaxseeds, chia seeds and walnuts but added a warning: "These give a different type of omega-3 that the body does not use so easily."

However, I have a strong suspicion that the husband’s temporary erectile dysfunction in response to his mother is going to require a significant amount of therapy. And the time to strongly suggest he consider looking into therapy was many years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

Because if it was always a thing, then he wasn’t masturbating as a teenager, as somebody living with parents. So I would have a lot more kinds of questions for the husband. It really does, to your point, seem like something to at least talk about with a professional.&lt;/p&gt;

Right? I’m not even sure you can get into a therapist that quickly in the U.S. these days.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="123" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7ky2yo001d3b77qgnov34s@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich: &lt;/strong&gt;A long-term solution is in order. Also, this is, at least temporarily, an issue that has an endpoint in sight. So it’s annoying for our writer to go a month or so without sex, but you can do it. It’s possible. It’s not food, you’re not going to starve. It’s sex, you can take care of yourself. You may not be able to avoid his mom during this period. So, that’s what it is. Given the abundance of issues that we see, not just in this column but in the world, I’m finding it a little bit difficult to sympathize. As much as I understand this is a serious issue, I also know you will live to see another day of sex.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="27" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7ky30u001e3b776cxff4fc@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica: &lt;/strong&gt;I’m able to sympathize. But at the end of the day, it’s just inconvenient. An erection is not the be-all and end-all of partnered sexual interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="4" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7ky32p001f3b77bkwleo7j@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich:&lt;/strong&gt; That’s very true.&lt;/p&gt;

Plenty of other people, for one reason or another, are partnered with someone who has a penis that doesn’t reliably become erect. Sometimes there is an erect penis, and people still choose to have sex without engaging with the penis. So, they’ve got a lot of options; all they have to do is get a little bit creative. I am a bit sorry that you’re not going to get dicked down real good during this time. But you will survive. If the husband is of the mindset that because he’s not hard, they’re not going to have sex, then you have hands. You can get sex toys and use your imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

Has he tried a PDE5 inhibitor? Has he used a cock ring? Sometimes you need that extra kind of assurance or lift to knock yourself out of a pattern. And then once you understand that you can do it through medical means, the psychological aspect can fall to the background because you’re just bumping yourself out of that loop of, &lt;em&gt;I see my mom, I can’t get an erection, this is my life&lt;/em&gt;. But then, if you can assist yourself medically, you can show yourself that you can do it. So, I wonder how much he has actually practiced getting over this.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="43" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7ky3ek001k3b77yc4wgarf@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica:&lt;/strong&gt; That is a really good point. Regarding this sentence: “I don’t think I can go without sex that long!”, think about that. What is sex doing for you in your life that maybe could be spread out over a more diverse toolbox?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="106" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7ky3gj001l3b77nxgxb930@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich: &lt;/strong&gt;Is it stress relief? Because if it is, you could try exercise or acts of charity. If you’re bored, you can read or watch a million things that are on TV. And if you’re that horny, again, just masturbate or have him masturbate with you. Figure out a different way for a little bit. It’s an opportunity to explore. This isn’t one of those situations where it’s the parents are staying with you, and if they hear you, it’s going to create a rift. It seems like they can still do whatever they’d like while the parents are living there. So create a new frontier.&lt;/p&gt;

I eagerly got back into the dating scene and met someone I was really into. Before having sex, we discussed that we were comfortable with not using condoms because of my sterility. However, when we were actually doing the deed, and things seemed to be going VERY well, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/01/sex-after-divorce-advice.html"&gt;I ejaculated inside of her vagina.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

However, small mutations in mitochondrial DNA can affect tissues with high-energy demands such as the heart, muscle and brain, causing devastating disease and, in some cases, death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Mitochondrial DNA is inherited from the mother, and although males can be affected, they do not transmit the disease, researchers said. About 1 in 5,000 babies are born worldwide each year with mutations that can cause the disease, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, scientists have detailed how an IVF technique called pronuclear transfer has been used to combine the DNA of three people to reduce the risk of mitochondrial disease being passed down the generations, in accompanying studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The technique uses 99.9 percent of the DNA from a man and woman, with another 0.1 percent from a second woman’s donor egg. It works by transplanting the nuclear genome of an egg from the mother with the condition - which contains genes essential for individual characteristics like hair color and height - to an egg donated by an unaffected woman that has had its nuclear genome removed, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The resulting embryo inherits nuclear DNA from its two parents, but the mitochondrial DNA comes from the donated egg, researchers said. The treatment was offered to certain women at very high risk of passing on serious mitochondrial disease, in accordance with U.K. regulations that assess each application for the procedure on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The eight infants &lt;strong&gt;- &lt;/strong&gt;who range in age from newborn to over 2 years old&lt;strong&gt; - &lt;/strong&gt;were assessed to be healthy, meeting developmental milestones and reported levels of mitochondrial disease-causing mutations that were undetectable or at levels unlikely to cause disease, the Newcastle University statement said. Three of the babies had levels of disease-causing mitochondrial DNA mutations of up to 20 percent, which is still below the 80 percent threshold for clinical disease, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Doug Turnbull, a neurologist at Newcastle University who co-wrote the study, said it was the first to document a “cohort” of children who had received the treatment. He said it is the result of an extremely cautious approach by scientists and regulators that has been more than two decades in the making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“People have used very similar techniques, but nobody’s quite used this particular technique,” he told The Washington Post in a phone interview Thursday. “It’s just absolutely critical when you’re doing a new technique to be cautious and to make sure … it’s as safe and efficient as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The procedure has also raised concern from some, including religious groups, about its ethics and the fear that it could open the door to further genetic modification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Peter Thompson, chief executive of the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority, which regulates the process in Britain, said that only people with a “very high risk” of passing on a serious mitochondrial disease are eligible for the treatment and that every application is assessed individually. As of July 1, 35 patients have been granted approval by U.K. authorities to proceed with the treatment since it was first licensed in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“These robust but flexible regulatory processes allow the technique to be used safely for the purposes that Parliament agreed in 2015,” Thompson said in a statement in response to Wednesday’s news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Scientists have cautiously welcomed the findings, while stressing the importance of long-term monitoring and raising the prospect of whether the procedure offers advantages over embryo screening for genetic disease. Others have raised the issue of cost in the long-term project that is supported by Britain’s National Health Service and medical charity the Wellcome Trust, among other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Mary Herbert, who is professor of reproductive biology at Newcastle University and lead author of the research paper, said “the findings give grounds for optimism” but further research is needed to “bridge the gap” between reducing risk of mitochondrial disease and preventing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Turnbull said the team is also looking to improve medical techniques and follow up with the children involved for as long as possible to track their health outcomes. He said researchers are offering health assessments for five years, but it “would be lovely to be able to follow them up much longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Joanna Poulton, a professor in mitochondrial genetics at the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the research, said “time will tell” whether the treatment results in “dramatic clinical advance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The births come amid a wider boom in genomic sequencing and IVF start-ups that have sparked a wider debate about the ethics and science behind embryo screening and genetic preselection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the United States, those undertaking IVF typically test for rare genetic disorders stemming from a single gene mutation, such as cystic fibrosis, or chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome. The use of donor mitochondria, however, is not permitted under U.S. regulations. In Britain, the creation of babies using DNA from three people was first made legal in 2015, hailed for its ability to prevent serious disease being passed on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related Content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2025/honduras-trans-woman-asylum-trump/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:An asylum seeker abandons her claim and leaves Trump’s America;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;An asylum seeker abandons her claim and leaves Trump’s America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/07/11/trump-rally-shooting-aaron-zaliponi-swat-team/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:He may have stopped Trump’s would-be assassin.

Even some of the possible causes require more research, they say.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2ccbed" class="body-graf"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2025.10218" target="_blank"&gt;a review&lt;/a&gt; published Thursday in JAMA, gastrointestinal cancers have become the fastest-growing type of cancers diagnosed in adults younger than 50 in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-306289" class="body-graf"&gt;The review, one of the most comprehensive looks at gastrointestinal cancer trends, summarized the findings of major international and U.S. cancer databases, plus 115 papers on gastrointestinal cancers published from January 2014 to March 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-786d2f" class="body-graf"&gt;The authors underscore the need for people to follow the screening guidelines for colorectal cancer, which &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/acs-recommendations.html" target="_blank"&gt;suggest that people with an average risk start screening&lt;/a&gt; — usually a colonoscopy or stool test — at age 45. Since doctors don’t routinely screen for pancreatic, stomach and esophageal cancers in the U.S., the authors also call for new ways to screen more people for these cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b076ae" class="body-graf"&gt;“This really points to the importance of trying to improve screening and early detection,” said Dr. Kimmie Ng, the review’s co-author and director of the Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4b6487" class="body-graf"&gt;According to the review, colorectal cancer is by far the most common early-onset gastrointestinal cancer, with nearly 185,000 cases reported worldwide in 2022 and nearly 21,000 cases reported that same year in the U.S. Diagnoses in the U.S. have risen 2% annually in people younger than 50 since 2011, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures-2023.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;according to the American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bb3245" class="body-graf"&gt;“It never used to happen in this age group, and now a very significant rise in 20-, 30- and 40-year-olds are getting colon cancer,” said Dr. John Marshall, chief medical consultant at the nonprofit &lt;a href="http://colorectalcancer.org" target="_blank"&gt;Colorectal Cancer Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, who was not involved in the research. In one of the most high-profile examples, actor Chadwick Boseman was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2016 and died of the disease four years later at age 43.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9f1ab0" class="body-graf"&gt;Early-onset cases of pancreatic, stomach and esophageal cancers are also rising, according to the new study. Previous &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjs/article/112/7/znaf102/8191209?searchresult=1" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has shown a disproportionate share of those gastrointestinal cancer diagnoses were among Black and Hispanic people. Pancreatic cancer is among the deadliest forms of cancer, with just &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/pancreatic-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html" target="_blank"&gt;13% of patients&lt;/a&gt; surviving five years after their diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6677ef" class="body-graf"&gt;Because colorectal cancer is the most common, doctors said they have a better grasp of what might be contributing to these early-onset cases compared with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c691c5" class="body-graf"&gt;“If we can understand what’s going on in colorectal [cancer], I think it would really provide a lot of guidance to help us understand the other GI tract cancers,” said Dr. Scott Kopetz, a professor of gastrointestinal medical oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eb5c48" class="body-graf"&gt;Kopetz said there are likely multiple factors driving the increase in early-onset cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7083ee" class="body-graf"&gt;“The leading theory is that there is no single leading theory,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6405bd" class="body-graf"&gt;Ng’s new review in JAMA suggests that most gastrointestinal cancers in people under 50 are associated with lifestyle factors such as obesity, lack of exercise, poor diet, cigarette smoking or alcohol consumption. One &lt;a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/70/12/2330" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; included in the review found that women who consumed more sugar-sweetened beverages during adolescence had a higher risk of developing early-onset colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-46cefa" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s really what people were doing or exposed to when they were infants, children, adolescents that is probably contributing to their risk of developing cancer as a young adult,” Ng said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-acb79f" class="body-graf"&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been vocal about the association between &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-announces-plans-remove-artificial-dyes-nations-food-supply-rcna202184" target="_blank"&gt;sugary beverages and health issues&lt;/a&gt;, including cancer. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump said Coca-Cola will start being made with cane sugar rather than corn syrup in the U.S., but the company &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/coca-cola-dodges-trump-says-soda-will-switch-back-cane-sugar-rcna219225" target="_blank"&gt;did not commit to the change&lt;/a&gt; when asked about it by NBC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e93909" class="body-graf"&gt;Marshall said he suspects the rise in early-onset colorectal cancer could have something to do with changes in people’s gut microbiomes — the bacteria that live in our gastrointestinal tracts. Diet, antibiotic use, microplastics and exposure to environmental chemicals likely all influence a person’s gut bacteria, but scientists still don’t have a clear understanding of what a healthy microbiome looks like nor how it affects our health. That is a booming area of research.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b6ba4c" class="body-graf"&gt;Ng’s review also found that 15% to 30% of people with early-onset gastrointestinal cancer carry hereditary genetic mutations that may have predisposed them to getting cancer at a young age.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Because of that, she said, “we do recommend that all young patients diagnosed under the age of 50 undergo testing for hereditary conditions.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d70c61" class="body-graf"&gt;Overall survival rates for gastrointestinal cancers have gotten better over time, due to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/stomach-cancer-diagnosed-earlier-symptoms-survival-rcna204536" target="_blank"&gt;improvements in treatment and screening&lt;/a&gt;.

When Martin has to return to work, her husband will need to take several unpaid days off to stay home with the boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It just makes me so mad that this is happening,” said Martin, 26, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. “It’s scary because my son is not protected, and I’m having to worry about child care and my job and my husband’s job.” In these situations, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/infection-control/hcp/measles/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends&lt;/a&gt; quarantine for 28 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because he’s too young for the measles vaccine, Hal needed emergency shots of immunoglobulin, or IG, an antibody that helps the immune system fight off infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, Martin said, “it’s just a waiting game.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her family’s worry and frustration are playing out in households nationwide as the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-cases-reach-highest-point-disease-was-eliminated-us-2000-rcna201421" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:number of measles cases has surpassed a level;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;number of measles cases has surpassed a level&lt;/a&gt; not seen since the highly contagious virus was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the CDC reported &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:1,309 cases of measles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;1,309 cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; in 39 states. The vast majority of patients are children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of those cases has had the opportunity to expose hundreds or even thousands of other people, especially kids, either too young to be vaccinated, like Hal, or children with weak immune systems, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ana Montanez, a pediatrician at Texas Tech Physicians in Lubbock, Texas, cared for many families during the recent &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-outbreak-west-texas-grows-unvaccinated-rcna192163" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:measles outbreak in West Texas;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;measles outbreak in West Texas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of our families, hard-working families, typically don't have a month's savings of salary to stay home, yet they have to," Montanez said. "Oftentimes it's not just one job, but two, maybe three."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cedar Rapids isn’t experiencing an outbreak of measles. Just &lt;a href="https://www.linncountyiowa.gov/1777/Measles#" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:seven cases have been confirmed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;seven cases have been confirmed&lt;/a&gt; across Iowa in 2025, according to the latest data in the state. They are the first reported measles cases in Iowa since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the Martin family’s situation illustrates the ripple effects of a single exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s happening in our town is a perfect example of why vaccination is important,” said Dr. Dustin Arnold, chief medical officer at UnityPoint Health-Cedar Rapids. “It just takes one” measles case, he said, to set off waves of impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Arnold ran a command center giving out immunoglobulin, or IG shots for eight babies who were exposed to measles at the same day care as Hal. Three others were sent to a nearby medical facility for the same treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IG injections can be given up to six days after exposure to measles. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8675579/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2021 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; found that the therapy is highly effective in protecting exposed newborns from getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IG treatments aren’t a permanent fix, said Dr. Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Children “develop much higher levels of immunity from vaccination than from immunoglobulin,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cedar Rapids IG clinics, led by Arnold, were pulled together at the very last minute. The babies who got the injections had been exposed six days earlier, on Monday, July 7. Families were notified late Friday, July 11, and the treatments started the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are infants out there who have no protection, and we don’t want them to get sick,” Arnold said. “Measles can be mild, but it can also be life-threatening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of measles patients have fared well despite their illness. Still, 13%, or 164 patients, needed to be hospitalized because of the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three people — including two young girls in Texas — have &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/second-measles-death-texas-child-kennedy-rcna199882" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:died of measles this year;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;died of measles this year&lt;/a&gt;.

Even some of the possible causes require more research, they say.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2ccbed" class="body-graf"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2025.10218" target="_blank"&gt;a review&lt;/a&gt; published Thursday in JAMA, gastrointestinal cancers have become the fastest-growing type of cancers diagnosed in adults younger than 50 in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-306289" class="body-graf"&gt;The review, one of the most comprehensive looks at gastrointestinal cancer trends, summarized the findings of major international and U.S. cancer databases, plus 115 papers on gastrointestinal cancers published from January 2014 to March 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-786d2f" class="body-graf"&gt;The authors underscore the need for people to follow the screening guidelines for colorectal cancer, which &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/acs-recommendations.html" target="_blank"&gt;suggest that people with an average risk start screening&lt;/a&gt; — usually a colonoscopy or stool test — at age 45. Since doctors don’t routinely screen for pancreatic, stomach and esophageal cancers in the U.S., the authors also call for new ways to screen more people for these cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b076ae" class="body-graf"&gt;“This really points to the importance of trying to improve screening and early detection,” said Dr. Kimmie Ng, the review’s co-author and director of the Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4b6487" class="body-graf"&gt;According to the review, colorectal cancer is by far the most common early-onset gastrointestinal cancer, with nearly 185,000 cases reported worldwide in 2022 and nearly 21,000 cases reported that same year in the U.S. Diagnoses in the U.S. have risen 2% annually in people younger than 50 since 2011, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures-2023.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;according to the American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bb3245" class="body-graf"&gt;“It never used to happen in this age group, and now a very significant rise in 20-, 30- and 40-year-olds are getting colon cancer,” said Dr. John Marshall, chief medical consultant at the nonprofit &lt;a href="http://colorectalcancer.org" target="_blank"&gt;Colorectal Cancer Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, who was not involved in the research. In one of the most high-profile examples, actor Chadwick Boseman was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2016 and died of the disease four years later at age 43.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9f1ab0" class="body-graf"&gt;Early-onset cases of pancreatic, stomach and esophageal cancers are also rising, according to the new study. Previous &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjs/article/112/7/znaf102/8191209?searchresult=1" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has shown a disproportionate share of those gastrointestinal cancer diagnoses were among Black and Hispanic people. Pancreatic cancer is among the deadliest forms of cancer, with just &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/pancreatic-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html" target="_blank"&gt;13% of patients&lt;/a&gt; surviving five years after their diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6677ef" class="body-graf"&gt;Because colorectal cancer is the most common, doctors said they have a better grasp of what might be contributing to these early-onset cases compared with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c691c5" class="body-graf"&gt;“If we can understand what’s going on in colorectal [cancer], I think it would really provide a lot of guidance to help us understand the other GI tract cancers,” said Dr. Scott Kopetz, a professor of gastrointestinal medical oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eb5c48" class="body-graf"&gt;Kopetz said there are likely multiple factors driving the increase in early-onset cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7083ee" class="body-graf"&gt;“The leading theory is that there is no single leading theory,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6405bd" class="body-graf"&gt;Ng’s new review in JAMA suggests that most gastrointestinal cancers in people under 50 are associated with lifestyle factors such as obesity, lack of exercise, poor diet, cigarette smoking or alcohol consumption. One &lt;a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/70/12/2330" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; included in the review found that women who consumed more sugar-sweetened beverages during adolescence had a higher risk of developing early-onset colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-46cefa" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s really what people were doing or exposed to when they were infants, children, adolescents that is probably contributing to their risk of developing cancer as a young adult,” Ng said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-acb79f" class="body-graf"&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been vocal about the association between &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-announces-plans-remove-artificial-dyes-nations-food-supply-rcna202184" target="_blank"&gt;sugary beverages and health issues&lt;/a&gt;, including cancer. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump said Coca-Cola will start being made with cane sugar rather than corn syrup in the U.S., but the company &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/coca-cola-dodges-trump-says-soda-will-switch-back-cane-sugar-rcna219225" target="_blank"&gt;did not commit to the change&lt;/a&gt; when asked about it by NBC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e93909" class="body-graf"&gt;Marshall said he suspects the rise in early-onset colorectal cancer could have something to do with changes in people’s gut microbiomes — the bacteria that live in our gastrointestinal tracts. Diet, antibiotic use, microplastics and exposure to environmental chemicals likely all influence a person’s gut bacteria, but scientists still don’t have a clear understanding of what a healthy microbiome looks like nor how it affects our health. That is a booming area of research.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b6ba4c" class="body-graf"&gt;Ng’s review also found that 15% to 30% of people with early-onset gastrointestinal cancer carry hereditary genetic mutations that may have predisposed them to getting cancer at a young age.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Because of that, she said, “we do recommend that all young patients diagnosed under the age of 50 undergo testing for hereditary conditions.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d70c61" class="body-graf"&gt;Overall survival rates for gastrointestinal cancers have gotten better over time, due to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/stomach-cancer-diagnosed-earlier-symptoms-survival-rcna204536" target="_blank"&gt;improvements in treatment and screening&lt;/a&gt;.

This seamless switching is crucial for adaptive behavior, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research highlights both shared and distinct neural networks for external and internal attention, revealing costs and trade-offs when shifting between them. Understanding these processes could illuminate how attention operates in natural settings and how disruptions may contribute to cognitive or psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Networks:&lt;/strong&gt; Both external and internal attention recruit overlapping frontoparietal networks, but internal attention also engages medial and ventrolateral prefrontal regions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switching Costs:&lt;/strong&gt; Behavioral studies show measurable performance costs when shifting attention between external and internal domains compared to within a single domain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Questions:&lt;/strong&gt; It remains unclear whether a superordinate control system coordinates these shifts or if they emerge from competitive dynamics within existing attention systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every day, your brain seamlessly balances between two worlds: the sights, sounds, and sensations streaming in from your surroundings, and the thoughts, memories, and plans you hold inside your mind. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This ability—to switch between focusing on what’s “out there” and what’s “in here”—is fundamental to how we adapt and function. Yet surprisingly, science has only recently begun to explore how the brain orchestrates this intricate dance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research sheds light on the neural mechanisms behind these shifts in attention, uncovering both striking similarities and critical differences between how the brain handles external and internal information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparing how we direct focus toward the sensory environment versus mental representations, scientists hope to explain not only everyday behaviors—like remembering your grocery list while watching traffic—but also shed light on disorders where these systems may go awry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why Attention Is More Than Meets the Eye&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For over a century, attention research focused primarily on the external world: how the brain selects and prioritizes sensory signals like sights and sounds. We now understand much about how frontal and parietal networks work together to amplify important signals, suppress distractions, and guide actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even early theorists recognized that attention doesn’t stop at the senses—it also operates inside the mind. Internal attention allows you to focus on a memory, an idea, or a plan, sifting through mental contents to guide behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies of internal attention gained momentum when scientists began to explore how cues can boost working memory performance by “retrofocusing” on specific stored items. These discoveries showed that internal attention can improve accuracy and even enhance the quality of memories being recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Switching Between Two Domains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In everyday life, however, external and internal attention rarely operate in isolation. Whether driving, working, or chatting with a friend, we constantly shift back and forth—watching what’s happening, recalling what to do next, imagining possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This raises a fascinating question: how does the brain switch between these two domains?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are finding that while external and internal attention share many of the same brain networks—particularly the dorsal frontoparietal system—they also engage unique regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internal attention seems to recruit medial and ventrolateral prefrontal areas, possibly because selecting among mental representations requires different computations than scanning the sensory world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behaviorally, switching between domains appears to incur a small but measurable cost: reaction times slow, and errors increase compared to switching between two tasks within the same domain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this cost seems to be asymmetrical—switching from external to internal focus tends to take longer than the reverse, perhaps because the external world so readily captures our attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Rhythms and Competition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some scientists suggest these shifts are not just deliberate but may also follow intrinsic rhythms. Attention appears to oscillate between external and internal focus on timescales from milliseconds to hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This rhythmic cycling could help the brain balance learning from the environment with consolidating internal models—ensuring neither domain dominates at the expense of the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence also suggests that external and internal contents interact competitively within sensory areas. When working memory contents and incoming sensory signals share the same features, they can interfere with each other—though higher-order areas like the parietal cortex may help shield internal representations from disruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Search for a “Switchboard”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What coordinates these shifts? Some hypotheses propose a superordinate control mechanism—a kind of neural “switchboard”—that determines when to prioritize external or internal information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candidates for this role include the hippocampus, which is known to alternate between encoding new sensory information and retrieving stored memories, and the anterior mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a region implicated in high-level control over competing cognitive demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other theories suggest no dedicated switchboard is necessary; instead, shifts between domains may emerge from competitive dynamics within shared networks, where whichever domain has more salient or urgent information wins out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging studies provide intriguing clues. Tasks that require switching between perceptual and memory-based decisions activate additional prefrontal and parietal regions compared to within-domain shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet measures of spatial attention—like subtle eye movements and alpha-band brain oscillations—shift at the same speed whether the target is external or internal, suggesting the bottleneck may lie later in processing, perhaps at the level of decision-making or motor planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding how the brain shifts between external and internal attention is not just an academic exercise. These mechanisms are central to flexible, adaptive behavior—allowing us to plan, reflect, and act effectively in a dynamic world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disruptions to these systems could underlie symptoms of conditions like ADHD, schizophrenia, and depression, where individuals may become stuck in internal rumination or overly reactive to external stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By pinpointing the neural underpinnings of these shifts, researchers aim to develop interventions that help restore balance—whether through cognitive training, neuromodulation, or targeted therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Open Questions and Future Directions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the field moves forward, many exciting questions remain. Can the brain operate external and internal attention in parallel, or do they always compete? Which neural circuits resolve conflicts between the two? How do different types of internal contents—like imagination, long-term memories, or future plans—interact with sensory inputs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experimental designs that mimic real-life scenarios, like navigating virtual environments or multitasking under time pressure, will help capture the natural ebb and flow between external and internal focus. Animal models, advanced imaging techniques, and computational models will also be key to untangling the complex dynamics of this interplay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Toward a Unified Understanding&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emerging view is that external and internal attention are not isolated systems but deeply intertwined aspects of a larger cognitive architecture. By understanding how the brain selects, prioritizes, and integrates information from both domains, we move closer to explaining how thoughts and perceptions come together to guide behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as importantly, this line of research reminds us that much of what we experience as “being present” in the world depends on the seamless and often invisible work of attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next time you catch yourself recalling a memory while glancing at a passing car—or planning your next move in a conversation while listening to someone speak—you’re witnessing your brain’s remarkable ability to bridge two worlds at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was supported by a Wellcome Trust Senior Investigator Award (ACN) 104571/Z/14/Z and by BrainWorks at the Center for Neurocognition and Behavior in the Wu Tsai Institute, Yale University (RRID: SCR_024556).

For decades, scientists have investigated mechanisms to anticipate, select, prioritize, and prepare sensory signals according to goals, memories, and salient events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, researchers have considered how these attention functions operate within internal representations. However, neither external nor internal attention in isolation captures everyday behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain frequently and seamlessly shifts between contents from the sensory stream and those held in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this perspective, we ask how the brain shifts between external and internal attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We describe similarities and differences between selective external and internal attention, present competing hypotheses regarding the operating principles of between-domain shifts, and highlight putative brain areas and mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discuss the scarce experimental forays comparing attention shifts between vs. within domains and contemplate how these constrain theoretical and computational models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conclude by suggesting open questions to guide investigation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 14:42:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOenUxZGZUTnp1ZkRId3VZOTRUenBNLXhrcXA2ZjI5UDQ4RHA2S1YwWnlmVlF2d0syVVR2SF81dUJtZzBfT0xLdzl6QnJmTlhjWG1GUTFsRWxYUnBXVmpxOU41YkpDeEtOckhxUXNwZHhnVERSX1FKZ0Y3RTQtU3NKeWM5WHVISmZk</guid></item><item><title>每分钟多走14步可以抵御老年人的虚弱影响-研究发现 | Walking 14 More Steps Per Minute Can Fight Off Frailty Effects For Seniors - Study Finds</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQRnhuLU44akxJRF9FU2FZUkZKWkduZGFsNHNtWk5HY2I1eXVnckFiVjFHbm9DVllUVmRwakZ1cW10QmlXTHdzTm5IXzk0T1E1T3JiMm5rNVJqZmRNOFRDVWdzNHg0Z1htX3FNd3QwYlFSN2VYLWNfSW05UFJ6Ym9aalREZGRyOGdRR3FTdTUzcXBYVFF2?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;&lt;div class="post-featured-image"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increasing walking speed by 14 steps per minute boosted the odds of meaningful functional improvement in older adults with frailty.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Participants who walked “as fast as they safely could” were nearly twice as likely to improve on a standard 6-minute walk test compared to those walking at a casual pace.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;These gains were linked to individual speed increases, not just being in the “intensive” exercise group.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The findings suggest that tracking walking cadence with simple devices can guide personalized exercise plans in senior care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHICAGO —&lt;/strong&gt; Picking up the pace during a walk might sound like obvious health advice, but for millions of older Americans already showing signs of physical decline, those extra steps per minute could be the difference between maintaining independence and losing it entirely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research tracking 102 &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/seniors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;seniors&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago-area retirement communities reveals that increasing walking speed by just 14 steps per minute during exercise dramatically improves physical function in people &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/frailty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;who are frail &lt;/a&gt;or becoming frail. The four-month study found that 65% of seniors who walked “as fast as they safely could” saw meaningful improvements in their ability to walk longer distances, compared to only 39% of those who stuck to a comfortable, leisurely pace.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For context, this means someone who normally walks at 80 steps per minute and bumps it up to 94 steps per minute could see real improvements in their &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/wellness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;daily physical capacity&lt;/a&gt; — the kind that affects whether they can handle grocery shopping, climb stairs, or maintain their independence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-growing-problem-of-frailty"&gt;The Growing Problem of Frailty&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Frailty affects roughly 15% of Americans over 65 and goes far beyond &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;normal aging&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a medical condition marked by unintentional weight loss, constant exhaustion, muscle weakness, slow movement, and low activity levels. Unlike typical age-related changes, frailty creates a dangerous downward spiral where people become less active, which makes them weaker, which makes them even less active.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This cycle dramatically increases the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/falling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;risk of falls&lt;/a&gt;, disability, hospitalization, and death. Breaking it has become urgent as America’s population ages rapidly, with researchers scrambling to find interventions that actually work for people who are already physically vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Walking programs have shown promise because they address multiple aspects of frailty at once. But figuring out &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/wellness/exercise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the right exercise&lt;/a&gt; “prescription,” that is, how often, how long, and how hard people should walk, has been tricky. That’s especially the case for older adults with heart conditions or those taking medications that affect their response to exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Faster walkers saw significant improvements in a 6-minute walking test that is often used for measuring physical function. (Inside Creative House/Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-counting-steps-works-better-than-heart-rate"&gt;Why Counting Steps Works Better Than Heart Rate&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditional ways of measuring exercise intensity often fail older adults. Heart rate monitors become unreliable when people take common medications like &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/beta-blockers-heart-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;beta blockers&lt;/a&gt;, which prevent heart rates from rising normally during exercise. Asking people to rate how hard they’re working on a scale of 1 to 10 also proves unreliable; many seniors struggle to accurately judge their exertion levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/steps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Counting steps&lt;/a&gt; per minute offers something much simpler and more objective. Anyone can track this using a smartphone or &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/fitness-trackers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;basic fitness watch&lt;/a&gt;, and previous research shows that hitting 100 steps per minute typically qualifies as moderate-intensity exercise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Chicago study, led by Dr. Daniel Rubin, an associate professor at the University of Chicago, equipped participants with highly accurate accelerometers worn on the thigh throughout each exercise session. These devices recorded every step, allowing researchers to calculate precise &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/walking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; speeds for each person across the entire four-month program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-experiment-fast-walkers-vs-comfortable-pacers"&gt;The Experiment: Fast Walkers vs. Comfortable Pacers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 102 participants, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/older-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;averaging nearly 79 years old&lt;/a&gt;, represented diverse racial and economic backgrounds from 14 retirement communities. The majority (80%) were women, and all showed signs of being frail or prefrail based on standard medical assessments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both groups followed identical schedules: three sessions per week, each lasting 45 minutes with 15 minutes of warm-up and cool-down plus 30 minutes of actual walking. The only difference was in the instructions given to each group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The “casual speed walking” group was told to maintain a “relaxed and comfortable pace.” The “&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/walking-speed-dementia-risk-older-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;high-intensity walking&lt;/a&gt;” group was encouraged to walk “as fast as they safely could.” All sessions were supervised by trained staff who provided standardized encouragement and safety monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the final phase of the program, the results were stark. The high-intensity group averaged 100 steps per minute compared to 77 steps per minute for the casual walkers. More importantly, the faster walkers were far more likely to see meaningful improvements in a standard fitness test called the 6-minute walk test.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 6-minute walk test measures how far someone can walk in six minutes, which is a strong predictor of overall physical function and independence. For frail older adults, improving by 30 meters or more is considered clinically meaningful, representing real-world differences in the ability to complete daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When researchers analyzed the data, they found that participants who increased their walking speed by 14 steps per minute from their comfortable baseline had significantly better odds of hitting this improvement threshold. Importantly, when they accounted for individual speed increases, the advantage of being in the “high-intensity” group disappeared entirely, meaning &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/walking-faster-type-2-diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the speed boost itself&lt;/a&gt;, not just being told to walk faster, drove the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The paper did not report any serious injuries, and participants were allowed to rest as needed during sessions. Those breaks didn’t count toward their 30-minute walking target.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0323759" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PLOS One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, offers immediate practical applications for assisted living facilities, community centers, and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/healthcare" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthcare providers&lt;/a&gt; working with older adults. Rather than generic “gentle exercise” programs, facilities could set individualized speed targets based on each person’s comfortable walking pace and use basic activity monitors to track progress toward that 14-step improvement goal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the millions of older Americans facing declining physical function, this research provides both hope and a concrete action plan. Maintaining independence may come down to something as measurable and achievable as adding 14 extra steps per minute &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/walking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;to regular walks&lt;/a&gt; — a remarkably specific target that could help transform how people age in America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers conducted a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial involving 102 prefrail and frail older adults (average age 79) living in 14 retirement communities in the Chicago area. Participants were randomly assigned to either a casual speed walking group or a high-intensity walking group. Both groups completed 48 exercise sessions over 4 months, with three 45-minute sessions per week. Each session included 15 minutes of warm-up and cool-down plus 30 minutes of walking. The casual group was instructed to walk at a comfortable pace, while the high-intensity group was told to walk “as fast as you safely can.” All participants wore thigh-mounted accelerometers during sessions to precisely measure walking cadence (steps per minute). The primary outcome was improvement in 6-minute walk test distance of at least 30 meters, considered clinically meaningful for this population.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants in the high-intensity walking group achieved significantly higher walking cadences than the casual walking group (100 vs. 77 steps per minute during the final phase). More importantly, 65% of high-intensity walkers showed meaningful improvements in their 6-minute walk test compared to 39% of casual walkers. The researchers found that increasing walking cadence by 14 steps per minute from baseline comfortable pace significantly increased the odds of achieving functional improvement. When individual cadence changes were accounted for, the group assignment effect disappeared, suggesting that the speed increase itself drove the benefits rather than other aspects of the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted in retirement communities with motivated volunteers who may not represent all frail older adults. All sessions were supervised by research assistants providing standardized encouragement, making it unclear whether unsupervised participants could achieve similar results. The baseline 6-minute walk distance of approximately 250 meters was well below community norms, highlighting the significantly impaired functional capacity of the study population. The authors noted that all participants were volunteers from retirement communities and were likely motivated, raising the possibility of selection bias.&lt;/p&gt;

Using functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy and reinforcement learning tasks, scientists found that high AIC Glx predicted both a general internalizing symptom score and heightened error sensitivity, which mediated this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During reward learning, AIC Glx decreased slightly, indicating dynamic metabolic changes, while the medial prefrontal cortex showed no such effects. These findings suggest that overactive insular glutamatergic signaling amplifies perceived errors, fueling maladaptive thought patterns seen in anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AIC Glutamate:&lt;/strong&gt; Elevated resting glutamate-glutamine levels in the anterior insula correlate with a general dimension of anxiety and depression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Error Sensitivity:&lt;/strong&gt; Heightened AIC Glx increases the tendency to overweight prediction errors, a cognitive bias linked to internalizing symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Changes:&lt;/strong&gt; During gain-based learning, AIC Glx levels decrease slightly, reflecting acute metabolic demands, while medial prefrontal cortex levels remain unchanged.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New research reveals that an overactive anterior insular cortex (AIC), a key hub for integrating emotional and bodily states, may contribute to anxiety and depression by making the brain more sensitive to errors and negative outcomes. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, combining cutting-edge brain spectroscopy and computational modeling, links elevated excitatory signaling in the AIC to a common dimension of internalizing symptoms and highlights how this overactivity shapes how we learn from mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Brain’s Hub for Feelings and Fears&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anterior insula sits deep within the brain’s folds and serves as a critical hub for sensing internal bodily signals, monitoring errors, and integrating emotions into decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111724"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Treatments that reduce glutamatergic overactivity in the AIC — whether through medications, neuromodulation, or behavioral therapies — may help dampen maladaptive error sensitivity and improve symptoms. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous neuroimaging studies have shown that the AIC is hyperactive in people with anxiety and depression, particularly when processing uncertainty or feedback about mistakes. But why the AIC behaves this way — and how this overactivity might link to the way people with these disorders perceive and respond to errors — has been unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glutamate, the brain’s main excitatory neurotransmitter, plays a central role in learning, plasticity, and emotional regulation. Dysregulation of glutamatergic signaling has been implicated in psychiatric conditions, with evidence that excessive glutamate activity in frontal brain regions heightens stress responses and emotional reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could the AIC’s glutamatergic tone explain why some people seem to overreact to errors, reinforcing worry and rumination?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, researchers recruited 56 healthy young adults to undergo functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS) — a neuroimaging technique that can measure concentrations of glutamate and its close relative glutamine, often combined as Glx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants also completed questionnaires measuring symptoms of anxiety and depression, which the team distilled into a single “general psychopathology factor” (or G-score) capturing shared internalizing tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Linking Brain Chemistry to Errors and Emotions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside the MRI scanner, participants performed a computerized decision-making task, repeatedly choosing between two options that carried either rewards or losses. The task was designed to test how sensitive participants were to prediction errors — the difference between expected and actual outcomes, which are crucial for learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, single-voxel fMRS scans measured Glx levels in the AIC and in a comparison region, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), both at rest and during the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. Individuals with higher resting Glx in the AIC were more sensitive to prediction errors during the task, both when learning from gains and from losses. They also scored higher on the G-score, indicating greater underlying symptoms of anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, error sensitivity fully explained the link between AIC Glx and the G-score — suggesting that heightened excitatory signaling in the AIC increases error sensitivity, which in turn fuels internalizing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these effects were specific to the AIC: Glx levels in the mPFC were not related to error sensitivity or symptoms. The AIC’s hyperactive glutamatergic state appears to bias individuals toward overestimating mistakes and negative feedback, feeding into the maladaptive thought patterns common in anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Dynamic Changes During Learning&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed dynamic neurochemical changes during the task. As participants engaged in reward-based learning, Glx levels in the AIC decreased slightly — perhaps reflecting the metabolic demands of active learning — and remained low afterward. Interestingly, this task-related reduction was specific to gain learning and did not occur during loss-based learning, nor was it observed in the mPFC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these transient changes did not disrupt the trait-like elevation of Glx in individuals with higher anxiety and depression symptoms. Even after the task, those with higher baseline AIC Glx still showed greater error sensitivity and higher G-scores, suggesting that the acute dips in glutamate during learning are superimposed on a more stable, elevated excitatory tone that biases cognition and emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why Does Error Sensitivity Matter?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Error sensitivity — the tendency to give disproportionate weight to mistakes or negative feedback — is an important cognitive process. In healthy learning, it allows people to adapt and improve their choices. But when excessive, it can lead to rumination, self-criticism, and avoidance, hallmarks of anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that an overactive glutamatergic system in the AIC may amplify how errors are perceived, making each mistake feel more salient and threatening than it should. This overestimation feeds into a cycle of worry and negative mood, providing a mechanistic link between brain chemistry, cognition, and internalizing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AIC’s unique role in integrating bodily states and emotions may make it especially prone to “tuning up” error signals when excitatory activity is high. While the mPFC is also involved in mood regulation, its neurochemical activity did not show the same dynamic changes or associations with symptoms, underscoring the AIC’s specific contribution to error-related affective processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Toward Better Treatments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These insights have potential clinical implications. Treatments that reduce glutamatergic overactivity in the AIC — whether through medications, neuromodulation, or behavioral therapies — may help dampen maladaptive error sensitivity and improve symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, some antidepressants and experimental glutamate-modulating drugs may exert their effects in part by normalizing insular glutamate signaling. Similarly, real-time fMRI neurofeedback training that teaches patients to downregulate AIC activity could help reduce error overestimation and worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also exemplifies the value of combining computational models of cognition with neuroimaging and advanced psychometric analysis. By measuring how people learn from feedback, how their brain chemistry shifts during the task, and how these patterns relate to general psychopathology, the researchers have uncovered a specific pathway by which brain chemistry may translate into maladaptive emotion and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Limitations and Future Directions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like all studies, this one has limitations. The sample was relatively small and limited to young, healthy adults, so the findings need to be replicated in larger and more diverse clinical populations. The cross-sectional design means that causal relationships cannot be firmly established; it’s possible that chronic anxiety and depression also alter insular glutamate levels over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the loss block always preceded the gain block, which may have influenced task-related Glx dynamics. Future studies could counterbalance block order and test longitudinal interventions aimed at modulating AIC glutamate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the findings strengthen the case for targeting insular glutamatergic signaling as a novel strategy to alleviate anxiety and depression, particularly in patients who exhibit heightened sensitivity to mistakes and negative feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anterior insula’s hyperactive glutamatergic system appears to heighten how strongly we feel and react to errors, fueling the worry and rumination that characterize anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By uncovering this specific neurochemical pathway, the study provides a clearer picture of how brain chemistry, cognition, and emotion interact — and opens new avenues for treatments that can restore balance to this overactive error-monitoring system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one of the study’s key messages suggests: by quieting the insula’s overexcited error signals, we may help quiet the mind itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this depression, neuroscience, and anxiety research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News Communications – Neuroscience News&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2025.1592015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Anterior insular cortex glutamate-glutamine (Glx) levels predict general psychopathology via heightened error sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;” by Bumseok Jeong et al. &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anterior insular cortex glutamate-glutamine (Glx) levels predict general psychopathology via heightened error sensitivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction:&lt;/strong&gt; The anterior insular cortex (AIC) integrates interoceptive, cognitive-emotional, and error-monitoring signals, and is consistently hyperactive in anxiety and depression. Converging evidence links elevated glutamate + glutamine (Glx) in fronto-insular regions to stress reactivity; however, it is unknown whether AIC Glx relates to a transdiagnostic general psychopathology factor (G-score) or to the tendency to overweight prediction errors during learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We therefore combined functional MRS (fMRS) with reinforcement-learning modeling to test whether (i) baseline AIC Glx predicts the G-score derived from bifactor analysis of PHQ-9, GAD-7, and STAI-X1, and (ii) task-evoked Glx changes track individual differences in error sensitivity during gain- and loss-based learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt; Fifty-six healthy adults (22 ± 2 yr, 16 women) completed the questionnaires and performed a two-armed bandit task (40 loss then 40 gain trials) while single-voxel semi-LASER spectra were acquired from AIC and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) at rest and during each block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six Rescorla-Wagner variants were fitted to the choices; the best model (based on the lowest LOOIC) included error sensitivity, decision temperature, and value decay. Glx (CRLB &amp;lt; 20%) was quantified using LCModel and analyzed with repeated-measures ANOVA and Bonferroni-corrected correlations; mediation was assessed using Baron-Kenny steps (α = 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; Baseline AIC Glx correlated with the G-score (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.39, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.004) and with error sensitivity for gains and losses (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;≈0.41–0.44, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; ≤ 0.005); mPFC Glx showed no such relations. AIC Glx fell during gain learning (−2.21%, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.034) and remained low post-task, whereas mPFC Glx was unchanged. Error sensitivity fully mediated the AIC-Glx/G-score link; associations were specific to Glx, not other metabolites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher excitatory tone in the AIC appears to enlarge prediction-error weighting, which in turn amplifies a shared anxiety-depression dimension. Dynamic Glx reductions during reward learning suggest acute metabolic demand superimposed on a trait-like baseline that biaes cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Targeting insular glutamatergic function–pharmacologically or via neuromodulation–may therefore mitigate maladaptive error processing that underlies internalizing psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 13:58:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFA3OWdkenM2SEwzbnNraWp0blFuWEEyTUF5cm0tSGdwZzFiLUtPYXduY1JWUWg3U3BhVEZxMlZPLTl2emltQ1JBcmczQ251NVVXbEhzQ2RoZVVZTzRMdzRra05SOU5tMmlmbGZkN2t3</guid></item><item><title>7月，麻疹感染儿童前往北泽西州的9个地点：请参阅列表-补丁 | Measles-Infected Child Went To 9 North Jersey Locations In July: See The List - Patch</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="styles_Section__card__4Uoov"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;BERGEN COUNTY, NJ — A Hudson County child with measles — a highly contagious and sometimes fatal virus — visited various spots in Bergen, Essex, and Hudson counties since July 4, including a mall and two restaurants, New Jersey officials said. They are urging people who visited the same locations to watch for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state has announced such cases so that the public can get treated early if they have the disease.

Because the disease is so contagious it requires at least 95 percent of a local population to be vaccinated in order to prevent its spread, health officials say. New Jersey's vaccination level recently dropped to 92 percent, &lt;a href="https://patch.com/new-jersey/ridgewood/measles-update-nj-state-says-3-cases-were-1-household-more"&gt;an official said.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visited Emergency Rooms Starting July 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="ContentBlocks_CardDetail__SubscribeBlock__4zBcQ ContentBlocks_CardDetail__SubscribeBlock--desktop__oN6vv"&gt;&lt;section class="styles_SubscribeForm__0dj5n"&gt;&lt;h2 class="styles_SubscribeForm__title__F_olP"&gt;Find out what's happening in Hoboken&lt;span class="styles_SubscribeForm__title--nextLine__FTO3K"&gt;for free with the latest updates from Patch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state health department said Tuesday, "The New Jersey Department of Health is alerting residents about a confirmed case of measles. &lt;br&gt;Individuals – especially parents, guardians, health care providers, and caregivers – are urged to be aware of the symptoms of this highly contagious virus and to ensure they are up to date with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) shots.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The single confirmed case is a resident of Hudson County and it is not known to be related to the Ocean County measles case reported last week."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child in question apparently was brought to two hospitals on July 4 and 5, then was released.

The findings raise important questions about the role of infections in mental health, violence, and personality traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurochemical Manipulation:&lt;/strong&gt; Parasites like &lt;em&gt;T. gondii&lt;/em&gt; increase dopamine production in the brain, influencing risk-taking and impulsivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Infected individuals may exhibit more aggression, impulsive decisions, and even heightened sexual risk behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Health Relevance:&lt;/strong&gt; Up to 80% of older humans may carry &lt;em&gt;T. gondii&lt;/em&gt;, underscoring the widespread potential for subtle behavioral influence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parasitic infections aren’t just a public health and hygiene concern—they could also shape how we think, feel, and act. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing body of research highlights how certain parasites, such as &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;, may subtly manipulate their host’s brain and behavior in ways that benefit the parasite’s survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications reach beyond individual health, suggesting that widespread infections could even influence societal trends in aggression, risk-taking, and mental health disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111720"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Infections with parasites that form cysts in the brain may disrupt key circuits in emotion and decision-making, raising risks of disorders like schizophrenia, depression, or even suicidal behavior. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new synthesis of evidence reviews how parasites hijack the nervous system and immune pathways to change behavior. Among the most notorious is &lt;em&gt;T. gondii&lt;/em&gt;, a protozoan carried by cats that infects up to 80% of older humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In animals, it famously removes rodents’ fear of cats—its definitive host—so it can complete its life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In humans, evidence suggests it alters dopamine balance, promotes impulsivity, raises aggression, and may even elevate sexual risk-taking and violent tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other parasites, like &lt;em&gt;Trypanosoma brucei&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bartonella henselae&lt;/em&gt;, and malaria-causing &lt;em&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/em&gt;, also appear to spark behavioral and neuropsychiatric changes in their hosts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are now unraveling the biochemical and neuroimmune mechanisms behind these effects. &lt;em&gt;T. gondii&lt;/em&gt;, for example, directly increases dopamine production in infected neurons by expressing its own tyrosine hydroxylase, a key enzyme in dopamine synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This increase in dopamine, along with immunomodulatory effects on brain inflammation, likely contributes to the impulsivity, risk-taking, and even sexually aggressive behaviors reported in some infected individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infections with parasites that form cysts in the brain may disrupt key circuits in emotion and decision-making, raising risks of disorders like schizophrenia, depression, or even suicidal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While research into the societal and individual impacts of these behavioral shifts is still in its infancy, the findings are provocative. They suggest that parasitic infections—often thought of as minor or asymptomatic—can have lasting effects on personality and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For public health and psychology, these insights open new avenues: increasing awareness of transmission risks (like handling raw meat or cat litter), developing vaccines or therapies that target these effects, and even rethinking the role of infections in aggression and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the next time we think about what drives risky, impulsive, or violent behavior, we may need to consider not just nature and nurture, but the possibility of parasites shaping our minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and personality research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News Communications – Neuroscience News&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1555024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sexually aggressive behavior triggered by parasitic infection – how parasites can influence our personality&lt;/a&gt;” by Marco Goczol. &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sexually aggressive behavior triggered by parasitic infection – how parasites can influence our personality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parasitic infections are not only a health problem, but also a psychological and behavioral one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that certain parasites can influence the personality traits and behavior of infected individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toxoplasma gondii, a well-known parasite, is suspected of increasing the risk of sexually aggressive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paper examines the links between parasitic infections and personality changes and analyzes the mechanisms by which parasites can affect the nervous system and associated behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim is to raise awareness of the psychological and behavioral effects of parasitic infections and to stimulate future research in this area.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 13:12:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE9fSTRZdDNxQlRUbXN0Tm1YQmowbXhTYnNJVVJETXN0RHdBRjRjOS1sQXRWOGtMYVliN0ZtUjF4WnlfcmVXMlRSdWxlZWVEVFpNYml5QmZKcVRBWFVJZWl3VTQ5SHVQSExPdDlBc0pGZw</guid></item><item><title>瑜伽休息冥想减轻压力并重塑皮质醇节律，研究发现- PsyPost | Yoga nidra meditation reduces stress and reshapes cortisol rhythms, study finds - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxPZnZJR1BEaFRFLXk5S1RtQXBha2xITm05bGFvWklVSHoya0NHYWJxb1NTS3VjWW54LWxZWFJQWWVDXzF5aHBmSUxfUmtxTzdYcUxVQmttclJYeTdFVGJ6a3NpdEZoTW1yUlNDMWFsNFA3ZURfWEhrNW9hV0xSdnFhcWNpNDI1SEt5cmI5eXdkc2x5M1ZqUlpBS09rVDNaN2FBb3gyMUFn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study finds that practicing a guided meditation known as yoga nidra can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. The research, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/smi.70049" target="_blank"&gt;Stress and Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, also shows that even short, 11-minute daily sessions can produce measurable changes in the body’s primary stress hormone, while longer 30-minute sessions may offer additional benefits for mindfulness and physiological regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoga nidra, sometimes called “yogic sleep,” is a guided meditation technique that brings practitioners into a deeply relaxed state while remaining conscious. The practice typically involves lying down, slowing the breath, setting intentions, and moving through stages of body awareness and imagery. In recent years, it has gained popularity under the label “non-sleep deep rest” and has been studied for its effects on emotional regulation, sleep, and anxiety. Although past studies suggested psychological benefits, researchers wanted to determine whether yoga nidra could also change physiological markers of stress, like cortisol, especially in a large, well-controlled study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I practice yoga nidra myself almost daily and find it incredibly helpful—not only for calming down, but also for gaining clarity and creative ideas through that short, conscious pause,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.psychologie-im-inntal.de/" target="_blank"&gt;Esther N. Moszeik&lt;/a&gt;, a research associate at &lt;a href="https://www.unibw.de/hum-psychologie/ppd/personen/moszeik" target="_blank"&gt;the University of the Bundeswehr Munich&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a previous study, we had already found that even 11 minutes of yoga nidra improved subjective sleep quality and mood. This follow-up study was designed to go one step further: we included biological stress markers, compared two yoga nidra formats, and added an active control group with music to better isolate the effects. I was also curious whether individual personality traits might influence who benefits most from which version—and how we find better matches between people and interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on cortisol, the body’s main stress hormone. The natural daily rhythm of cortisol, including a sharp rise upon waking and a gradual decline throughout the day, is a key indicator of the body’s stress response system. Deviations from this pattern have been linked to chronic stress and mental health issues. The research team set out to determine if yoga nidra could help regulate this biological rhythm and improve psychological well-being at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate these questions, the researchers conducted an online randomized controlled trial. They recruited a large sample of 362 German-speaking adults and randomly assigned them to one of four groups. The first experimental group practiced an 11-minute version of yoga nidra. The second experimental group practiced a longer, 30-minute version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see if yoga nidra had unique effects beyond simple relaxation, a third group served as an active control, listening to 10 minutes of calming instrumental music. A fourth group was a waitlist control, receiving no intervention during the study period, which served as a baseline for comparison. Participants in the intervention groups were asked to engage in their assigned practice, ideally daily, for two months using pre-recorded audio files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure the effects, all participants completed a series of online questionnaires before the intervention began, immediately after the two-month period, and again at a three-month follow-up to assess any lasting changes. These questionnaires measured perceived stress, symptoms of anxiety and depression, the tendency to ruminate on negative thoughts, overall satisfaction with life, and sleep quality. They also assessed five different facets of mindfulness, such as the ability to act with awareness and accept thoughts without judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, a subset of 229 participants provided saliva samples to measure their cortisol levels. They collected five samples at specific times over two consecutive days, which allowed the researchers to map each person’s daily cortisol pattern, including the morning rise and the slope of decline throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study revealed that both forms of yoga nidra had a positive impact on mental health. When compared to the waitlist control group, the 11-minute yoga nidra practice led to reductions in stress, anxiety, depression, and rumination. Participants in this group also reported an increase in their satisfaction with life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these effects were statistically significant, they were small in size, representing improvements of about 8% to 16% of a standard deviation. However, even small effects can be meaningful when they come from a low-cost, easily accessible intervention. When compared against the active control group that listened to music, the 11-minute yoga nidra practice showed a distinct advantage in one area: it significantly reduced symptoms of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One surprise was that even the brief 11-minute meditation produced noticeable benefits – we often assume longer is better, but the short daily practice made a difference,” Moszeik told PsyPost. “We also found hints that not everyone responds in the same way: certain personality traits seemed to amplify the benefits of the meditation: for example, very conscientious individuals showed bigger gains than others and people high in neuroticism appeared to benefit especially strongly from the longer, 30-minute sessions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When comparing the two lengths of yoga nidra, the researchers found that the 30-minute version was not universally superior to the 11-minute one. The main difference was that the longer practice led to a greater increase in one specific facet of mindfulness known as “acting with awareness.” This refers to the ability to remain focused on one’s present actions and be less easily distracted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the 30-minute practice did show broader benefits when compared to the control groups. For example, when compared to the waitlist group, the 30-minute session produced significant reductions in stress, anxiety, depression, rumination, and sleep disturbances. It also produced a noteworthy biological change: it resulted in a flatter cortisol awakening response. This means the typical sharp spike of the stress hormone in the morning was less pronounced, suggesting a more relaxed start to the day and less anticipatory stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For participants in the 11-minute group, practicing more frequently was associated with changes in their cortisol patterns. Regular practice was linked to a reduction in total cortisol output throughout the day and a steeper decline in the hormone from morning to evening, a pattern generally associated with better health and well-being. This suggests that consistency is a key component for achieving biological benefits, even with a very short practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the 30-minute group, more frequent practice was associated with reduced rumination and increased mindfulness, but it was also linked to a higher cortisol awakening response. The researchers speculate that for those engaging in longer, more regular practice, the meditation may transition from being primarily relaxing to being more energizing or activating over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main takeaway is that a simple daily relaxation practice like yoga nidra can have real, measurable benefits for your well-being,” Moszeik said. “We observed small but meaningful improvements in stress and mood for people who practiced yoga nidra compared to those who didn’t, and even their cortisol (a key stress hormone) showed a healthier daily rhythm. It’s important to know that cortisol isn’t purely ‘bad’ – in fact, we need it to wake up and get energized – but chronic stress can throw its cycle out of balance. Our findings suggest that taking just a few minutes to deeply relax each day helps keep your cortisol levels in a better balance over the day, which is linked to feeling calmer and more resilient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has several strengths, including its large and diverse sample, the use of a randomized controlled design with an active control group, and the inclusion of a biological marker for stress. Administering the intervention online also demonstrates its potential for widespread, low-cost implementation. However, the study also has some limitations. The online format meant that participants did not receive personal guidance or support, which can be an important part of learning a new meditation practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The improvements we saw were statistically significant but quite small in magnitude,” Moszeik noted. “In other words, yoga nidra isn’t a quick fix or miracle cure – it’s more like a gentle and steady nudge toward feeling better. Another limitation is that our study relied on participants practicing on their own at home, so we had to trust their self-reports about how often and how well they did the meditation. We also mainly studied healthy adults who were interested enough to sign up for a meditation trial, which means the results might not generalize to everyone. Finally, while we did include a follow-up, we only tracked outcomes for a few months, so we don’t yet know how durable these effects are in the long run.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the research team aims to build on these findings by exploring how to personalize these kinds of interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results hinted that factors like personality could moderate how much someone benefits, so one next step is to figure out which types of people respond best to which techniques,” Moszeik explained. “For instance, maybe some individuals thrive with a short daily practice while others need a longer session or a different kind of meditation – understanding those differences can help tailor stress-management programs to the person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re also interested in seeing what happens if people continue practicing yoga nidra beyond two months: Do the benefits accumulate or reach a plateau? And do these changes in cortisol and well-being translate into tangible health outcomes (like better sleep, focus, or fewer stress-related symptoms) over time? Ultimately, our goal is to make mind-body interventions like this as effective and accessible as possible, by learning how to match the right practice to the right person.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’d add that it was encouraging to see both the short and long versions of yoga nidra have benefits, which means people can choose what fits their schedule and still gain something,” Moszeik said. “Even a brief 11-minute daily routine was enough to improve some mental health measures, especially for parents, people in leadership positions, and older men. On the other hand, the 30-minute version did provide a bit of an extra boost in certain areas – for example, it seemed to further calm the spike of cortisol we normally get after waking up in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, there’s flexibility: you don’t necessarily need a huge time commitment to help manage stress, but if you can set aside a bit longer, you might see additional advantages. Overall, we hope this study shows that taking time out for deep relaxation isn’t just a nice indulgence – it’s a practical tool that can make a positive difference in your daily life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/smi.70049" target="_blank"&gt;The Effects of an Online Yoga Nidra Meditation on Subjective Well-Being and Diurnal Salivary Cortisol: A Randomised Controlled Trial&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Esther N.

It also had an impact on her social life because she was worried someone might bump into her shoulder and cause her pain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Frozen shoulder, which causes pain and stiffness often brought on by an injury, can persist for months (sometimes years) and make everyday activities difficult&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Frozen shoulder, also known as adhesive capsulitis, affects around a million people a year in the UK and occurs when the capsule of tissue that surrounds the shoulder joint becomes inflamed and thickens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The capsule is usually large enough to allow for a full range of motion in a normal shoulder,' says Rajeev Sharma, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon in private clinics across London and Hertfordshire, who specialises in shoulder, elbow and hand surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'With an inflamed condition such as frozen shoulder, the capsule thickens - and as a result the space for movement also reduces, which is the main cause for the stiffness.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some people also develop neck pain as the stiffness in the shoulder joint may mean muscles in the neck overcompensate for the lack of motion in the shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Often caused by injury 'such as a fall or even a minor stretch such as reaching for something in the back of a car', Mr Sharma says a frozen shoulder is also more common if you have diabetes. The theory is that persistently high blood sugar can make the surrounding shoulder tissue thicker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he adds it is women in the 40 to 60 age bracket - the age at which most women go through the menopause - who are most at risk of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The question is, why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has suggested a link to the drop in oestrogen that occurs around menopause to an increased risk of frozen shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rajeev Sharma, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon, says that women in their 40s to 60s - the age at which they go through the menopause - are most at risk of suffering from frozen shoulder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study by Duke University in the US, involving 1,952 women - of which 152 were taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) normally given to make up for the drop in oestrogen that occurs during menopause - found that patients who were not taking HRT were 99 per cent more likely to develop a frozen shoulder compared to those receiving HRT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results, published in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine in 2023 make sense, says Dr Elise Dallas, a menopause specialist at The London General Practice, as oestrogen 'plays several important roles in musculoskeletal health'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Oestrogen has anti-inflammatory properties and supports bone growth, as well as connective tissue health,' she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As oestrogen levels drop during menopause, collagen (an integral part of the connective tissue that forms the muscles, ligaments and tendons) can become stiffer, reducing the flexibility of joints, including the shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fall in oestrogen levels also leads to an increase in levels of cytokines, compounds which can trigger inflammation in the shoulder joint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This inflammation can cause pain, thickening of the ligaments, and tightening of the joint capsule - hallmarks of frozen shoulder,' says Dr Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, others argue that one study is not enough proof that the hormonal change that occurs during menopause is to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Sharma says that as women aged 40-60 years account for most frozen shoulder patients, the condition 'will often get correlated with menopause, even though there is no direct link to the hormonal changes of menopause'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently, as it is there is no 'cure' for frozen shoulder but treatments can help improve symptoms while the healing process takes place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common, says Mr Sharma, is hydrodistension or hydro-dilatation, where a combination of saline, local anaesthetic and a steroid is injected into the joint capsule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The steroid helps in reducing the symptoms of the pain and the high volume of saline attempts to relax the capsule for increased mobility of the shoulder joint,' says Mr Sharma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physiotherapy and exercise can help maintain shoulder strength - 'though sometimes exercises and physiotherapy can cause more pain when the frozen shoulder is in its initial and aggressive phase,' he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Emma tried physiotherapy and home remedies such as ice, wheat bags (small sacks that you heat up in the microwave), massages, a massage gun and 'every type of painkiller', which all helped short term, 'but sometimes the pain was horrendous'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even sitting to relax and watch TV was painful. I had to prop my left arm on a cushion because I couldn't let it drop to one side as it was too painful.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In severe cases patients may need an MRI scan to confirm diagnosis. Then a hydrocortisone injection. Mr Sharma says steroid injections 'help reduce inflammation and provide pain relief while the condition resolves itself naturally and can make the recovery journey more comfortable'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Emma's GP initially refused to refer her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then fate intervened just before Christmas in 2023 when Emma fell, injuring her shoulder. She was given an X-ray and MRI in A&amp;amp;E, which confirmed her frozen shoulder diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The doctor said they see many women of my age with it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Emma was referred a specialist at Kingston Hospital for a hydrocortisone injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She had the injection in January last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I must admit, I've never felt pain like it,' says Emma. 'It was excruciating.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But within a week she felt some improvement and over the course of the next couple of months, her shoulder got progressively better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She went on holiday with her partner Stuart, 57, to Indonesia and Singapore, where as it happens, 'they refer to frozen shoulder as "50s shoulder" – clearly they have a better awareness of the link to menopause', says Emma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A year on, the mobility in Emma's shoulder has improved dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My shoulder mobility is now around 97 per cent and although I find it too painful to do something like play tennis, which I used to do two or three times a week, I'm mostly back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm doing three or four aqua aerobic sessions each week to help it improve further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I just want more women to know that if they start experiencing shoulder pain around this stage of life, it's worth seeking medical advice sooner rather than later.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Autism has long been seen as a single—if highly heterogeneous—condition. But rather than one continuous spectrum, there are distinct autism subtypes, each tied to its own genetic signature, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-025-02224-z" target="_blank"&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research, published 9 July in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Genetics&lt;/em&gt;, connects genetic differences to specific patterns in how autism traits appear, supporting the notion that there are “many autisms,” says &lt;a href="https://www.iit.it/people/michael-lombardo" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Lombardo&lt;/a&gt;, senior researcher of neurodevelopmental disorders at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia in Genoa, Italy, who was not involved in the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying the genes linked to autism subtypes is just the beginning, Lombardo says. The real challenge now, he adds, “is unraveling the biology that stems from those genes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers, led by &lt;a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/people/profile/ogt" target="_blank"&gt;Olga Troyanskaya&lt;/a&gt;, professor of computer science and integrative genomics at Princeton University and deputy director for genomics at the Flatiron Institute in New York City, used a computational model to analyze data on 5,392 autistic children aged 4-18 years and their non-autistic siblings collected through the SPARK study. (The Flatiron Institute and the SPARK datasets used in the study are funded by the Simons Foundation, &lt;em&gt;The Transmitter&lt;/em&gt;’s parent organization.) The data include genetic findings and parent-reported information on developmental milestones, cognitive and behavioral traits, co-occurring conditions and family history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The machine learning analysis grouped the autistic people into four subtypes based on their genetic signatures and clinical patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “Social/behavioral” group—accounting for 37 percent of the sample and whose participants show repetitive behaviors, communication challenges and co-occurring conditions, but few developmental delays—has common genetic variants linked to ADHD and depression, and rare variants in genes active primarily after birth in certain brain cells. Another 19 percent belong to the “Mixed ASD with Developmental Delay” group, which hit many milestones later in development than children without autism but typically don’t have co-occurring conditions such as anxiety and depression; these participants carry many rare, damaging variants—both inherited and new—in genes active during early brain development in utero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="flex flex-col text-center text-red font-serif-text mt-5 mb-4 lg:my-12 lg:w-1/2 lg:ml-14 lg:-mr-52 lg:mt-16 lg:mb-6 lg:float-right lg:flex-row lg:flex-start lg:text-start"&gt;
    
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p class="font-light italic text-2sm p-0 lg:text-3md"&gt;
            [The real challenge now] ‘is unraveling the biology that stems from those genes.’        &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p class="mt-px lg:my-4 lg:hidden"&gt; — &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;span class="block font-sans font-bold leading-4.2 text-2xs uppercase mt-2 mb-1 lg:mt-6 lg:text-sm"&gt;
                &lt;span class="hidden lg:inline"&gt; — &lt;/span&gt;
                Michael Lombardo 
            &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another group, called “Moderate challenges” (34 percent), is distinguished by a developmental pattern similar to the Social/behavioral group, though with less severity; its participants have rare genetic changes in less essential genes, which may explain their mild core autism traits. The 10 percent of children in the “Broadly affected” group, on the other hand, have prominent autism traits from an early age and carry a heavy load of rare mutations in key genes, including targets of a protein involved in fragile X syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="first-letter:text-2xl first-letter:float-left first-letter:text-red first-letter:pr-2 pb-0"&gt;
    T&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
hese genetic differences track with the ages at which children reached certain developmental milestones and their age at autism diagnosis. For example, the groups with variants in early-expressed genes—the Broadly affected and the Mixed ASD with Developmental Delay groups—showed delays in early developmental skills and earlier diagnoses, whereas the group with variants in genes expressed after birth—the Social/behavioral group—had later diagnoses and developmental timelines similar to those of non-autistic children.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are a lot of kids who seem very neurotypical until a bit later in childhood,” says study investigator &lt;a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/natalie-sauerwald/" target="_blank"&gt;Natalie Sauerwald&lt;/a&gt;, associate research scientist of computational genomics at the Flatiron Institute. “The fact that we were able to find genetics that aligns with that was really surprising.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other research efforts have identified &lt;a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/validating-autism-subtypes-a-crucial-but-often-overlooked-step-in-research/"&gt;autism subgroups&lt;/a&gt;, but none currently offer the definitive take on how to group populations within the autism spectrum—likely because results depend on who’s studied and how, Lombardo says. The new study included children aged 4-18, which increased the sample size but introduced variability, because a preschooler and a teenager are at different developmental stages, he says. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44220-023-00056-6" target="_blank"&gt;His own work&lt;/a&gt;, focused on narrower age ranges, has found fewer subtypes, suggesting that different datasets may yield different subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, rather than linking genes to single traits as in past investigations, Troyanskaya and colleagues looked at a person’s overall combination of traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team validated their new findings using data from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC), which contains information gathered by clinicians. The autism subtypes identified based on parent-reported data were consistent with those found in the SSC, which suggests that the subtypes reflect real differences, Troyanskaya says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more data become available, the identified autism subtypes may be further refined, revealing additional genetic and clinical details within each group, she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More data can validate the findings across diverse populations and adult cases, which could eventually lead to more tailored diagnoses and support in the future, Sauerwald says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://research.pasteur.fr/en/member/thomas-bourgeron/" target="_blank"&gt;Thomas Bourgeron&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Human Genetics and Cognitive Functions Unit at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, who was not involved in the work, agrees. “Some individuals need medical support, maybe gene therapy, and others need better inclusion in society, better recognition of neurodiversity and so on,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, he adds, a common limitation in autism research is that it focuses too much on clinical data and not enough on real-life experiences, so there’s a need for more practical, long-term information to better understand how autism affects daily life. “We need to have a better idea of the trajectory of these individuals.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="181" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6dkwz600153b77cw3bpnsz@published"&gt;Your boss does seem to have a real illness, but it has nothing to do with moles. I can’t diagnose him through a letter, but you might be right that he has hypochondria. Also known as intense health anxiety, it is a form of mental illness that can be disruptive and dangerous, but treatable. Two main syndromes are defined in psychiatry’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554399/"&gt;illness anxiety disorder&lt;/a&gt;, or excessive fear of developing a medical condition, and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532253/"&gt;somatic symptom disorder,&lt;/a&gt; which involves excessive concern about physical symptoms. The COVID pandemic&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/mentalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmen.0000120"&gt; exacerbated many people’s health anxiety&lt;/a&gt;. (Masking at work isn’t necessarily a sign of hypochondria, though; dangerous respiratory diseases are still circulating.) The availability of Dr. Google has created a new twist on hypochondria called “&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29324396/"&gt;cyberchondria&lt;/a&gt;,” or excessive searching for medical information. You aren’t your boss’s psychiatrist, and this (among other things!) is definitely not your job, but you or one of your colleagues could tell him that intense worry about health is getting more &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-hypochondria-can-be-deadly-and-how-newer-treatments-help/"&gt;medical attention as a common and treatable problem&lt;/a&gt;—and potentially nudge him toward seeking help.&lt;/p&gt;

You could tell him that you’re simply too busy with your actual work to help search for medical information. You could say that it’s inefficient for you to do these searches since you aren’t experiencing the symptoms yourself and wouldn’t know what to follow up on. Or try the privacy approach: His perceived symptoms might lead to a diagnosis he wouldn’t want to share, and out of respect for his privacy, you don’t think it’s appropriate for you to dig into the medical literature. There’s also the “this is too serious for me” option: “I don’t feel qualified to evaluate and discuss information about health conditions, but the doctors covered by our employer’s insurance can help.”&lt;/p&gt;

I have been told I’ll receive a severance package, but I’ve had a few potential employers express interest in me. I don’t want to leave my already understaffed store without the help they need, but I know I need to protect myself in an uncertain job market. Nothing has been offered directly to me yet, but I’m very tempted by one potential employer. The employer I’m interested in knows my current employer well, and I’m scared my current employer will find out I’m on the hunt and fire me preemptively. He’s known for making snap decisions. How do I know when/if to jump ship?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2qqy001z3b7704k8qrtt@published"&gt;Your current employer did the right thing by admitting that the company is going out of business. And they are right to offer severance to reward people who stay until the end. Did they tell you how much severance? If it’s, say, three months’ worth of your salary or more, it would probably make financial sense to stay. You could use the severance-funded time to do a thorough job search, and maybe take some time off between jobs. But if they’re being vague about the amount, or if you’re worried the severance could disappear when the company does, don’t let it tie you to a doomed employer. Companies fire people all the time for their own reasons; you have every right to quit for yours.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="155" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2qr000203b77j3448qbt@published"&gt;It sounds like you need more information, and I think it’s worth the risk to have honest-ish conversations with both your current and potential employers. I suggest you start with the latter. Tell them you feel a sense of loyalty to your existing team. (Taking your job seriously makes you even more attractive as a potential hire.) Follow up by saying that you admire the future employer’s work and are intrigued by the possibility of joining them. It’s usually a good idea in a job interview (or pre-interview) to express enthusiasm for the future employer, which explains why you’re talking with them despite your loyalty to your current job. Say explicitly that you would like to keep this conversation confidential for now since you’re not actively looking for work. A potential employer should never share hiring conversations, period, but people are lousy at secrets, and it’s reasonable to confirm that they won’t mention it elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2qr200213b77k3mbmffu@published"&gt;The potential employer’s response will tell you a lot about whether you want to work there: Do they respect your privacy? Are they open about their timeline for hiring you? If they do make an offer and want you to start right away, you could use your dilemma during negotiations. Mention that you would be giving up a severance package if you leave your other job before the end of the year … but if there’s room to increase their salary offer, that would make your decision easier.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2qr300223b77y4r46chf@published"&gt;If you decide to stay in your current job, you could use these overtures to push for more information or opportunities. Tell your boss you appreciate his honesty about the company going out of business. Say you’d like to stay to the end, and you have not been looking for a job, but you have been approached by potential future employers. If Mr. Snap Decisions looks like he’s about to blow a gasket, backtrack by telling him you just thought he deserved to know that competitors are taking an interest in his employees, and cut the conversation short.&lt;/p&gt;

The company is understaffed, and closing down a business is complicated, so there might be opportunities for you to take on interesting new responsibilities and develop different skills. Tell your boss you’re hoping to make the most of the next few months in the job and you’d like to find out more about what you can contribute. You might even be able to get a new title by the end that could help you get a job at the next level, wherever you land next.&lt;/p&gt;

I was offered a new job, and I am two weeks in. It is in the realm of what I want to be doing. My stress levels aren’t as high, and I don’t fear working in an unsafe environment.&lt;/p&gt;

I am struggling with feeling as though I’ve become a babysitter to the older residents who are residing there while receiving medical care. That is not part of the job description. They have aides, they are just not always present in the areas where I am assigned, but the aides should be around at all times due to the fall risks of some of the residents.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2xic002i3b77lw85vfj2@published"&gt;Well, the inevitable happened. An unmonitored resident fell while I was leading a program. I felt awful. They couldn’t speak to answer questions, which made matters worse. English is also not their first language. I spent my entire day off ruminating on what happened and thinking about whether I should be working here. I never received a reply or feedback from my supervisor after I messaged them about what happened. Any advice? I know looking for another workplace is a great solution, but it took me a year to land this job.&lt;/p&gt;

The learning curve for any new job can be steep and unsettling. It’s natural to ruminate on work problems, especially at the start. Give yourself time to understand the workplace better, and give yourself grace to know you’re doing your best in an imperfect environment. Be patient with yourself and your co-workers as you learn this new job while still recovering from the trauma of the old one.&lt;/p&gt;

Ask your supervisor for a check-in after your first few weeks. Don’t mention their lack of response to your message; your supervisor might have too many messages to monitor, and you don’t want to set them up to be defensive. Instead, say you want to make sure you understand your responsibilities and proper procedures. Among other things, you want to know how you can help protect the residents if they’re unaccompanied. (Avoid the word “babysitter,” which sounds disrespectful.) If their aides aren’t present, should you alert your supervisor? Or the aides’ supervisor? Go seek the aides out yourself? Or should you monitor residents when they’re participating in one of your programs? If this responsibility wasn’t in your job description, well, job descriptions are often incomplete, and you need to know what’s really expected of you before you make any decisions about whether to stay, go, or stay and fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive impairment is increasing globally. All stages of dementia are marked by declines in memory and executive function. Previous research has examined whether micronutrient levels may relate to cognitive resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Association between dietary copper intake and cognitive function in American older adults," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-09280-9" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/i&gt;, researchers designed a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cross-sectional+analysis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cross-sectional analysis&lt;/a&gt; to evaluate the relationship between dietary copper consumption and cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cohort of 2,420 participants aged 60 years or older was selected from the 2011–2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). All participants had complete data on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dietary+intake/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dietary intake&lt;/a&gt; and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dietary copper intake was derived from two averaged 24-hour dietary recalls. Cognitive function was measured using four instruments: the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), the Animal Fluency Test (AFT), the immediate and delayed recall subtests of the CERAD protocol, and a composite Z score reflecting global cognition. Copper intake was stratified into quartiles.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Multivariate linear regression models were used to test associations. In the fully adjusted model, participants in the highest copper intake quartile (Q4, ≥1.44 mg/day) had higher scores than those in the lowest quartile (Q1, &amp;lt;0.76 mg/day): DSST (β=3.80, 95% CI 1.90, 5.70), AFT (β=1.23, 95% CI 0.48, 1.99), CERAD-DRT (β=0.47, 95% CI 0.15, 0.80), and Z score (β=0.20, 95% CI 0.10, 0.29). No statistically significant association with CERAD-IRT was found in the fully adjusted model (β=0.58, 95% CI −0.06, 1.22).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants in the higher copper intake quartiles were more likely to be male, non-Hispanic white, married, and higher income, with lower smoking prevalence and more favorable nutritional profiles, including higher intake of zinc, iron, selenium, and total energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spline-based regression modeling showed an inverted L-shaped association between copper intake and DSST, AFT, and Z score. Cognitive test performance improved with copper intake up to thresholds of 1.63 mg/day (DSST), 1.42 mg/day (AFT), and 1.22 mg/day (Z score).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond these thresholds, associations with DSST, AFT, and Z score lost statistical significance, showing near zero change and wide confidence intervals..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants with a history of stroke showed a stronger association between copper intake and global cognition. In this subgroup, Q4 intake was associated with a higher Z score than Q1 (β=0.55, 95% CI 0.24, 0.86; p for interaction=0.009). No significant interaction effects were observed for other demographic or clinical variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors conclude that copper intake was associated with better cognitive function test scores in older adults. Associations were strongest at moderate intake levels and most pronounced in individuals with prior stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the precise mechanisms underlying the relationship between dietary copper intake and cognitive function remain unknown, the authors state that the findings "… are considered biologically plausible. Dietary copper is crucial for brain health and may confer protective effects on cognitive function through its involvement in antioxidant defense, neurotransmitter synthesis, and energy metabolism."&lt;/p&gt;

He’s not had the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, which isn’t recommended until age 1. When Martin has to return to work, her husband will need to take several unpaid days off to stay home with the boy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f13e9b" class="body-graf"&gt;“It just makes me so mad that this is happening,” said Martin, 26, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. “It’s scary because my son is not protected, and I’m having to worry about child care and my job and my husband’s job.” In these situations, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/infection-control/hcp/measles/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends&lt;/a&gt; quarantine for 28 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-06fcbd" class="body-graf"&gt;Because he’s too young for the measles vaccine, Hal needed emergency shots of immunoglobulin, or IG, an antibody that helps the immune system fight off infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-76da3c" class="body-graf"&gt;At this point, Martin said, “it’s just a waiting game.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4c2628" class="body-graf"&gt;Her family’s worry and frustration are playing out in households nationwide as the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-cases-reach-highest-point-disease-was-eliminated-us-2000-rcna201421" target="_blank"&gt;number of measles cases has surpassed a level&lt;/a&gt; not seen since the highly contagious virus was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a759e8" class="body-graf"&gt;On Wednesday, the CDC reported &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;1,309 cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; in 39 states. The vast majority of patients are children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e7f320" class="body-graf"&gt;Each of those cases has had the opportunity to expose hundreds or even thousands of other people, especially kids, either too young to be vaccinated, like Hal, or children with weak immune systems, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-af4654" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Ana Montanez, a pediatrician at Texas Tech Physicians in Lubbock, Texas, cared for many families during the recent &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-outbreak-west-texas-grows-unvaccinated-rcna192163" target="_blank"&gt;measles outbreak in West Texas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e41b0b" class="body-graf"&gt;"A lot of our families, hard-working families, typically don't have a month's savings of salary to stay home, yet they have to," Montanez said. "Oftentimes it's not just one job, but two, maybe three."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd465b" class="body-graf"&gt;Cedar Rapids isn’t experiencing an outbreak of measles. Just &lt;a href="https://www.linncountyiowa.gov/1777/Measles#" target="_blank"&gt;seven cases have been confirmed&lt;/a&gt; across Iowa in 2025, according to the latest data in the state. They are the first reported measles cases in Iowa since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6d63eb" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, the Martin family’s situation illustrates the ripple effects of a single exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b56e5e" class="body-graf"&gt;“What’s happening in our town is a perfect example of why vaccination is important,” said Dr. Dustin Arnold, chief medical officer at UnityPoint Health-Cedar Rapids. “It just takes one” measles case, he said, to set off waves of impact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-035921" class="body-graf"&gt;On Saturday, Arnold ran a command center giving out immunoglobulin, or IG shots for eight babies who were exposed to measles at the same day care as Hal. Three others were sent to a nearby medical facility for the same treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-052e01" class="body-graf"&gt;IG injections can be given up to six days after exposure to measles. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8675579/" target="_blank"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; found that the therapy is highly effective in protecting exposed newborns from getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-205a8a" class="body-graf"&gt;IG treatments aren’t a permanent fix, said Dr. Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Children “develop much higher levels of immunity from vaccination than from immunoglobulin,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-262dd2" class="body-graf"&gt;The Cedar Rapids IG clinics, led by Arnold, were pulled together at the very last minute. The babies who got the injections had been exposed six days earlier, on Monday, July 7. Families were notified late Friday, July 11, and the treatments started the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0b4c4c" class="body-graf"&gt;“There are infants out there who have no protection, and we don’t want them to get sick,” Arnold said. “Measles can be mild, but it can also be life-threatening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a6b370" class="body-graf"&gt;The majority of measles patients have fared well despite their illness. Still, 13%, or 164 patients, needed to be hospitalized because of the infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-739ffb" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Three people — including two young girls in Texas — have &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/second-measles-death-texas-child-kennedy-rcna199882" target="_blank"&gt;died of measles this year&lt;/a&gt;.

The results are even more surprising. Researchers have discovered that gut bacteria produce a molecule that not only induces but also causes atherosclerosis, the accumulation of fat and cholesterol in the arteries that can lead to heart attacks and strokes. This unexpected link between microbes and &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2023-12-11/three-minutes-of-intense-exercise-a-day-can-improve-cardiovascular-health-in-sedentary-women.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/health/2023-12-11/three-minutes-of-intense-exercise-a-day-can-improve-cardiovascular-health-in-sedentary-women.html"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; — the leading cause of death in humanity — is a paradigm shift. The work was published Wednesday &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09263-w" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09263-w"&gt;in the journal &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a showcase for the world’s best science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The in-depth study of Santander employees using advanced medical imaging equipment soon revealed another shocking finding: atherosclerosis was ubiquitous. The volunteers were apparently healthy, aged between 40 and 55, but 63% of the participants showed signs of the disease. The new results show that some gut bacteria, in certain states, produce imidazole propionate, a simple molecule with six carbon atoms, eight hydrogen atoms, two nitrogen atoms, and two oxygen atoms (C₆H₈N₂O₂). This compound enters the blood, interacts with immature white blood cells, and triggers an inflammatory reaction in the arteries, which promotes the buildup of fatty plaques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“Imidazole propionate induces atherosclerosis on its own. There’s a causal relationship,” asserts the biologist David Sancho, 53, leader of the new study at the National Center for Cardiovascular Research (CNIC) in Madrid. His team administered the molecule to mice, which developed the disease. Furthermore, scientists observed elevated levels of imidazole propionate in one out of every five volunteers with active atherosclerosis, the type in which fatty plaques are more likely to rupture and form the blood clots that cause heart attacks and strokes. The new results demonstrate that atherosclerosis is not only a disease caused by fat, but that it also has an inflammatory &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2024-07-02/from-the-wheelchair-to-the-bicycle-car-ts-achieve-spectacular-remissions-against-autoimmune-diseases.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2024-07-02/from-the-wheelchair-to-the-bicycle-car-ts-achieve-spectacular-remissions-against-autoimmune-diseases.html"&gt;and autoimmune component&lt;/a&gt;, according to Sancho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="a_m a_m-h "&gt;&lt;span class="_db a_m_w"&gt;&lt;img alt="Aorta arteries from a healthy mouse (left), another exposed to imidazole propionate (center), and another treated with propionate and an inhibitor drug, with red staining of atherosclerotic plaque." decoding="auto" class="_re lazyload a_m-h" srcset="https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/GYU5WVCRXJF7LMV4LM5QYL7W34.png?auth=e0101706e037800f217aad3fae228fd5f7a6b26d68dcf5c71477b376dc498357&amp;amp;width=414 414w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/GYU5WVCRXJF7LMV4LM5QYL7W34.png?auth=e0101706e037800f217aad3fae228fd5f7a6b26d68dcf5c71477b376dc498357&amp;amp;width=828 640w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/GYU5WVCRXJF7LMV4LM5QYL7W34.png?auth=e0101706e037800f217aad3fae228fd5f7a6b26d68dcf5c71477b376dc498357&amp;amp;width=980 1000w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/GYU5WVCRXJF7LMV4LM5QYL7W34.png?auth=e0101706e037800f217aad3fae228fd5f7a6b26d68dcf5c71477b376dc498357&amp;amp;width=1960 1960w" sizes="(min-width:1199px) 1155px,(min-width:1001px) calc(100vw - 44px),(min-width:768px) 767px, 100vw" src="https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/GYU5WVCRXJF7LMV4LM5QYL7W34.png?auth=e0101706e037800f217aad3fae228fd5f7a6b26d68dcf5c71477b376dc498357&amp;amp;width=414" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="a_m_p" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aorta arteries from a healthy mouse (left), another exposed to imidazole propionate (center), and another treated with propionate and an inhibitor drug, with red staining of atherosclerotic plaque.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="a_m_m"&gt;CNIC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The good news is that if C₆H₈N₂O₂ causes the problem in a significant percentage of patients, steps can be taken to prevent it.

This could help explain why some people develop heart disease despite having few or no traditional risk factors, such as high cholesterol or high blood pressure,” he emphasizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="a_m a_m-h "&gt;&lt;span class="_db a_m_w _pr lb_btn"&gt;&lt;img alt="Left to right: the biologist David Sancho and the pharmacologists Annalaura Mastrangelo and Iñaki Robles, at the National Center for Cardiovascular Research in Madrid." decoding="auto" class="_re lazyload a_m-h" srcset="https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/SNWJQHZDERDHTARAG5MFUL5I6Y.jpeg?auth=a86605930325f41d7350f19ea30746d51960ed8934a2ea93236762aabd8d0167&amp;amp;width=414 414w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/SNWJQHZDERDHTARAG5MFUL5I6Y.jpeg?auth=a86605930325f41d7350f19ea30746d51960ed8934a2ea93236762aabd8d0167&amp;amp;width=828 640w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/SNWJQHZDERDHTARAG5MFUL5I6Y.jpeg?auth=a86605930325f41d7350f19ea30746d51960ed8934a2ea93236762aabd8d0167&amp;amp;width=980 1000w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/SNWJQHZDERDHTARAG5MFUL5I6Y.jpeg?auth=a86605930325f41d7350f19ea30746d51960ed8934a2ea93236762aabd8d0167&amp;amp;width=1960 1960w" sizes="(min-width:1199px) 1155px,(min-width:1001px) calc(100vw - 44px),(min-width:768px) 767px, 100vw" src="https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/SNWJQHZDERDHTARAG5MFUL5I6Y.jpeg?auth=a86605930325f41d7350f19ea30746d51960ed8934a2ea93236762aabd8d0167&amp;amp;width=414" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden="true" class="icon_multimedia_ampliar | _pa a_m_i a_m_i-a _dn" viewbox="0 0 40 40"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#svg-ampliar"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="a_m_p" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Left to right: the biologist David Sancho and the pharmacologists Annalaura Mastrangelo and Iñaki Robles, at the National Center for Cardiovascular Research in Madrid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="a_m_m"&gt;CNIC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Cardiovascular diseases kill 18 million people each year. Banco Santander’s chairman, &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2014/09/10/inenglish/1410337590_990302.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2014/09/10/inenglish/1410337590_990302.html"&gt;Emilio Botín, died of a heart attack&lt;/a&gt; four years after signing off on the project, which has allowed for the analysis of more than 4,000 volunteer workers, 400 of whom are included in this new study. The research, conducted using expensive and complex techniques such as computed axial tomography (CAT) and positron emission tomography (PET), has made it possible to detect high levels of imidazole propionate in the very early stages of atherosclerosis, which could greatly facilitate diagnosis at that invisible stage when a person is unknowingly at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Sancho and his colleagues acknowledge that further research will be needed to identify the specific strains of bacteria capable of producing the molecule, but they point to “changes in intestinal microbial ecology” following dietary modifications, with an increase in bacterial genera such as &lt;i&gt;Escherichia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Eubacterium&lt;/i&gt;. When Fuster presented the project in 2010, he noted how difficult it is to diagnose cardiovascular problems early and how simple it is to prevent them, with measures &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2025-07-08/tell-me-who-you-are-and-ill-tell-you-how-to-exercise-different-personalities-enjoy-different-workouts.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/health/2025-07-08/tell-me-who-you-are-and-ill-tell-you-how-to-exercise-different-personalities-enjoy-different-workouts.html"&gt;such as exercising&lt;/a&gt;, following a healthy diet, and not smoking. The new study shows that blood levels of imidazole propionate are lower in people with diets rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, tea, and low-fat dairy products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The Argentine microbiologist Federico Rey and Indian pathologist Vaibhav Vemuganti applaud the “exciting opportunities” that the new study opens for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. In a commentary also published Wednesday in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;, the two experts emphasize that exposure to imidazole propionate worsens plaque formation in the arteries of mice. “This effect occurs independently of changes in cholesterol levels, a surprising result given the central role of cholesterol in the development of atherosclerosis,” note the two specialists, from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “This discovery offers an interesting clue about a possible new factor involved in the origin of atherosclerosis. This is very relevant because, although lowering cholesterol — through drugs called statins, for example — can effectively reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, a considerable proportion of people still experience adverse cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarctions or strokes,” they warn. The CNIC itself said in a statement that the new study “could revolutionize” the diagnosis and treatment of atherosclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Sancho stresses that the work has been made possible thanks to the collaboration of thousands of volunteer employees of Banco Santander in Madrid, but also thanks to grants of €1 million from the “la Caixa” Foundation, €150,000 from the European Research Council and €100,000 from the State Research Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The discovery of the decisive effect of imidazole propionate on atherosclerosis takes place against a backdrop in which the scientific community is revealing the unknown role &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2025-01-21/tell-me-what-bacteria-live-in-your-gut-and-ill-tell-you-who-your-friends-are.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/health/2025-01-21/tell-me-what-bacteria-live-in-your-gut-and-ill-tell-you-who-your-friends-are.html"&gt;of intestinal microbes&lt;/a&gt; in some human diseases. The biotechnologist Cayetano Pleguezuelos and his colleagues at the Hubrecht Institute (The Netherlands) demonstrated in February 2020 that a strain of the bacterium &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; produces a toxic molecule, called colibactin, which damages the DNA of human cells and causes malignant tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Cases of colorectal cancer are skyrocketing in people under the age of 50, due to unknown causes, doubling in many countries in the last two decades. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09025-8" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09025-8"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt;, led by computational biologist Marcos Díaz Gay, suggested just three months ago that behind this colorectal cancer epidemic is the &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; toxin. “In young patients, up to 39 years of age, we see that colibactin pattern in one out of every three cases,” stressed Díaz Gay, of the National Cancer Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sign up for &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en" rel=""&gt;&lt;i&gt;our weekly newsletter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>EL PAÍS English</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 08:50:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-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</guid></item></channel></rss>
