The show captures the exhaustion and desperation many cancer patients feel, and the seductive allure of ditching traditional medicine for the promise of a “natural” cure. It also exposes the dark underbelly of the alternative health industry — a world where quacks and influencers prey on the vulnerable. They speak with unwavering confidence, yet their claims are backed by zero peer-reviewed evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know this all too well ... because I almost fell for it myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer in December 2022. I immediately began scheduling consultations with surgeons, but most appointments were pushed to mid- or late January because of the holidays. With weeks to wait, I decided to use the time proactively — or so I thought — and met with Dr. T, an integrative medical doctor, to explore if supplements could support my health while I waited for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Dr. T fully backed my decision to pursue surgery, she mentioned another holistic practitioner, Dr. D, who specialized in &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjenniedurant%2Fbreast-cancer-essay&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.healthline.com%2Fhealth%2Fbreast-cancer%2Fthermography&amp;amp;xcust=7851554%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:thermography;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;thermography&lt;/a&gt;. She explained that thermography — a thermal imaging technique that maps blood flow on the breast’s surface — potentially can identify areas of abnormal heat linked to inflammation or tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What caught my attention, though, was her offhand remark that Dr. D had allegedly “healed” a breast cancer patient without surgery, radiation or chemotherapy. As a science writer curious about holistic medicine, I was intrigued. Could thermography detect my cancer? I decided to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span&gt; Courtesy Jennie Durant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author shortly before breast-conserving surgery at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I arrived at Dr. D’s office, I noticed that it felt more like a spa than a medical clinic — a welcome change from the windowless rooms with fluorescent lighting where I’d gotten my breast screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thermogram process involved nine thermal images taken with a special camera, followed by a “cold challenge” where I submerged my hands in icy water to test how my body responded. I was told that healthy tissue cools in sync with the brain’s signals, while cancerous or inflamed areas resist the change and show up as hot spots on the thermogram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was fascinated, but I couldn’t ignore the red flags: thermograms &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjenniedurant%2Fbreast-cancer-essay&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fnews-events%2Fpress-announcements%2Ffda-issues-warning-letter-clinic-illegally-marketing-unapproved-thermography-device-warns-consumers&amp;amp;xcust=7851554%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:aren’t FDA approved ;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;aren’t FDA approved &lt;/a&gt;as standalone tests for detecting breast cancer, and the technician operating the machine turned out to be the doctor’s wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After waiting for 30 minutes for my results — an eternity that left me uneasy — Dr. D finally called me into his office. And then, things took a bizarre turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, he showed me the rainbow-colored thermogram report and acknowledged that it hadn’t detected my cancer — in fact, he seemed visibly flustered by the imaging fail. Instead, it had only revealed “extra heat” in the area, putting me in the “high-risk” category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, he revealed his theory: My cancer was caused by “too many COVID vaccines,” and I shouldn’t get another. I was too stunned to respond. Not only is there zero evidence linking COVID vaccines to breast cancer or other “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjenniedurant%2Fbreast-cancer-essay&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.contagionlive.com%2Fview%2Fmrna-covid-19-vaccines-and-turbo-cancer-the-latest-myth-that-won-t-disappear&amp;amp;xcust=7851554%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:turbo cancers;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;turbo cancers&lt;/a&gt;,” the claim flew in the face of my personal history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What about the fact that my mom had the same type of cancer, in the same breast, at the same age?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He dismissed this outright. “No, it’s definitely the vaccines,” he insisted, before pivoting to his next pitch: Super Mineral Water, a product he sold in his clinic, which he claimed could “detox” my body and possibly help cure me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By then, I was equally horrified and embarrassed — not just by his quackery, but by my naiveté for walking into this mess. I grabbed my things and left as quickly as I could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span&gt; Courtesy Jennie Durant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author ringing a bell after finishing a month of radiation treatment at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After my experience, I turned to the internet and stumbled on some comment boards about thermograms. One post led me to the story of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjenniedurant%2Fbreast-cancer-essay&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodmorningamerica.com%2Fwellness%2Fstory%2Fbreast-cancer-survivor-shares-cautionary-tale-relying-solely-60728490&amp;amp;xcust=7851554%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Morganne Delian;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Morganne Delian&lt;/a&gt;, a believer in homeopathic medicine who opted for a thermogram instead of a mammogram to detect cancer when she felt a lump in her breast. The thermogram practitioner reportedly told Delian that he couldn’t see a lump but warned she had “mild to moderate risk of developing aggressive breast tissue.” Months later, after finally undergoing a mammogram and a biopsy, she was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stories like Delian’s are chilling reminders of the potential dangers posed by unproven screening tools and alternative therapies.

Part of it, I think, is the allure of control in a moment when you feel paralyzed with terror. A cancer diagnosis strips you of your agency — your body feels like a traitor and your treatment plan is dictated by a team of experts that you’ve just met. Alternative medicine offers the illusion of empowerment and personalized care. Quacks don’t bog you down with statistics, side effects or limitations — they offer hope and simplicity. In a world where cancer treatments are scary or difficult to understand, that simplicity and hope can become irresistible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After my diagnosis, one of the best things I did was learn to trust my cancer team and the science that guided them. I abandoned my wishful thinking — the fantasy of the “lovely healing experience,” like Milla’s tropical Hirsch retreat in “Apple Cider Vinegar.” Instead, I embraced the stark reality of white hospital walls and a windowless operating room, where my surgeon skillfully removed my tumor and left me cancer free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span&gt; Courtesy Jennie Durant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author and her husband at the D.C.

I also take tamoxifen daily, a preventative medicine that I’ll take for at least five years, or for as long as my oncologist advises. Why? Because she’s the expert — not me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science saved my life. It saves lives every day. Yet, we’re in a dangerous moment when people distrust the regulators and science communities tasked with protecting them, while placing blind faith in politicians and influencers who profit from our vulnerability. &lt;em&gt;Apple Cider Vinegar&lt;/em&gt; exposes the dark side of these charismatic characters — people who lie as easily as they breathe.

The second case is a 1-year-old in Denver who recently traveled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said Monday they confirmed the case in an unvaccinated Denver County infant resident. They recently traveled with family to an area of Chihuahua, Mexico, which is experiencing a measles outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news was announced in a joint press release from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials urged Coloradans to check their vaccination status and monitor for symptoms like fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash that usually starts several days after exposure on the face and spreads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who were at the Denver Health emergency department on Sunday, April 6 from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. may have been exposed, according to the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news comes after &lt;a href="https://www.cpr.org/2025/03/31/colorado-measles-case-pueblo/"&gt;a case was reported&lt;/a&gt; at the end of March, of a Pueblo adult who had traveled to an area of Mexico where there is an ongoing measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Infants under 12 months are especially vulnerable to measles because they are typically too young to be vaccinated. This case is a stark reminder that families traveling internationally should delay unnecessary travel or talk to their health care providers about early MMR vaccination for infants, especially when visiting areas with known measles outbreaks,” said Dr. Rachel Herlihy, state epidemiologist and deputy chief medical officer at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She expressed gratitude to Denver Health and the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment “for their swift action, expertise, and collaboration in identifying this case and protecting the broader community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babies normally get the routine dose of measles, mumps, and rubella — or MMR vaccine — at 12 to 15 months. Measles is highly contagious and often severe, but it is a preventable disease. Health officials say the MMR vaccine remains the best protection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorado’s vaccination rate for measles is &lt;a href="https://www.cpr.org/2025/04/01/colorado-below-herd-immunity-for-measles/"&gt;1 percentage point lower&lt;/a&gt; than needed to reach herd immunity, Herlihy said in a press conference when the first case was announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we call the community immunity or herd immunity threshold for measles is about 95 percent. So statewide we are falling short of that. So that does mean that Colorado is potentially at risk for outbreaks,” said the state epidemiologist, Rachel Herlihy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of April 3, 2025, a total of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;607 confirmed measles cases&lt;/a&gt; were reported nationally, more than other recent years, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition to Colorado, cases have been confirmed in Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has recorded two deaths this year; in 12 percent of the cases, the person was hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Colorado Public Radio</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 00:50:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFAteGNYSjJPUFYtMFZjZTFBS3NhLXQ2cHpiRnpfQkIxUEpfTTF3Sll3VWdmaVA5emlsbHA1ZVN3UExiaVZ0RWZMbVRHclNXWW5SM1JkX3NSeHY4RlJxQXFVOFhkd0JmMVVNTWtpZEVlNDBLaXBDM0pWWEJqdGlPdw</guid></item><item><title>Indiana Department of Health confirms first measles case in 2025 - WLKY</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxNTk5jTzI1NXAzTlc5bnFpc3NTUmZaSjhURW4yajNpbWFBWXhXS01XbEZLTlRYT3FkcUtuX1laMU9Lb1p2V0hvMlQzZmtsS1V6TTlkTjlSeWpWRm13bjJiM29FVi05dk05WnU5OFhmUjJybkxwNVVsTTFGTFNobUVhZkFmZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-content--body-text-raw"&gt;

Though the findings describe only a correlation, experts said the data underscored the need for screening and early treatment of diabetes, a condition that is becoming more common worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In the United States, an estimated &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/php/data-research/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;10 percent of women&lt;/a&gt; had diagnosed diabetes in 2021, and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/pregnancy/gestational-diabetes#:~:text=Gestational%20diabetes%20(GDM)%E2%80%94diabetes,have%20it%20after%20giving%20birth." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;9 percent&lt;/a&gt; of pregnant American women develop gestational diabetes every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“We’ve known for some time that there’s some link between elevated glucose levels in pregnancy and future neurodevelopmental disorders,” said Dr. Elizabeth Halprin, who is chief of adult diabetes at the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston and was not involved in the study. The new findings speak “to the need to control diabetes during pregnancy,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;h3 class="css-15h6bi9 e1gnsphs0" id="link-58147e68"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"&gt;The Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The analysis, which pooled data from 202 studies on more than 56 million pregnancies around the world, examined outcomes for children whose mothers had Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes while pregnant, or were diagnosed with gestational diabetes. These conditions are collectively referred to as “maternal diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Even when studies accounted for other factors like a woman’s age or body mass index, children born to women who had diabetes during pregnancy were 28 percent more likely to have a neurodevelopmental issue than children whose mothers didn’t have the disease. The risks of A.D.H.D. and intellectual disability were slightly higher compared with those of other issues, like autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jctd2000v2cqxd7bo1bho@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is on the ground in Texas for the second time this year, as an ongoing multistate measles outbreak centered in the western part of the state has grown to one of the worst the United States has seen in decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk00053b6m464isa6j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC team of three is meeting with state and local officials to assess “the immediate needs to respond to this outbreak,” the agency said, and more staff will be sent once the assessment is complete, after a formal request from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and an order from US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk00063b6mlls0mnl3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But recent threats confronting public health have made the response to the outbreak more challenging than it may have otherwise been, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk00083b6mz0oqz75r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS announced sweeping layoffs last week, including an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/27/health/hhs-rfk-job-cuts/index.html"&gt;2,400&lt;/a&gt; from the CDC. The CDC also pulled back over $11 billion in grants to state and local health departments that were allocated during the Covid-19 pandemic but that local departments say were being used to respond to other public health threats, including the measles outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk00093b6mp6nqc6s6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a result of federal funding cuts, New Mexico – which has reported 54 measles cases as part of the outbreak – terminated contracts for 20 temporary workers who were helping order vaccines and check vaccination records.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000a3b6mugpo9458@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The cuts “resulted in our agency canceling some contracts with community providers that provide outreach to underserved communities relating to vaccination efforts and education,” said Robert Nott, communications director for the New Mexico Department of Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000b3b6mbvgwy84e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Dallas, more than 50 immunization clinics had to be canceled after the cuts, according to Dr. Philip Huang, director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department. Some of these outreach efforts were in schools that had low rates of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jjni900033b6ofrdcmsng@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dallas County has not reported any measles cases this year, but as other parts of the state prepare for potential spread of the outbreak, Huang warned that his county’s lab testing capacity may be affected.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000c3b6m1dsef7y2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As local health officials scramble to increase vaccinations, they say they’re seeing a great deal of vaccine hesitancy among communities affected by the outbreak. Yet efforts to understand this hesitancy and what could promote increased vaccination have also been halted, with &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/28/health/vaccine-research-safety-nih-funding/index.html"&gt;at least two dozen&lt;/a&gt; research grants related to those topics canceled in the past few weeks by the National Institutes of Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000d3b6m69zk7t7n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The studies that were cut were really focused on improving the preventative care experience and health outcomes for children and for families,” said Dr. Sophia Newcomer, an epidemiologist at the University of Montana whose grant analyzing CDC data on how and when children get vaccinated was terminated last month.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000e3b6mzjxd52q8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What we see today is a big outbreak of measles, and it’s clear that we need now, more than ever, high-quality vaccination services in every corner of the US.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000g3b6mdvafpli4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Growing vaccine hesitancy has been coupled with a steady decline in trust in public health since the Covid-19 pandemic, which experts say can further hamper the effectiveness of programs and interventions that are central to an outbreak response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000h3b6mt1v2jkwp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “State and local health departments often build trust one interaction at a time, and that investment is important because it’s the currency that public health operates with,” said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. “The science and data guide us in how to respond to measles outbreaks, but it’s trust, built over time, that can compel people to listen and act on public health guidance.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000i3b6mc5tjq42x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Just over half of US adults have favorable views of state and public health officials, according to a KFF &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/28/health/public-health-kff-poll/index.html"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; from January; about 54% said they trust local health officials “a great deal” or “a fair amount” to make the right recommendations on health, down from 64% in June 2023. Key federal health agencies, including the CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration, also saw similar dips in public opinion over that time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000j3b6m0p02cmvd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kansas has reported 24 confirmed cases of measles, which the state health department said may be linked to the outbreak centered in West Texas. But some patients there&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;are reluctant to be tested for measles, limiting abilities to capture the full scale and epidemiology of the outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000k3b6m4jy9n08c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are encountering individuals that are apprehensive or are resistant to testing. While the reasons for their decision have not been disclosed to our office, these individuals are willing to engage in discussions about their health status and the steps necessary to prevent the spread of measles,” Kerri Ulrich, health department administrator in Kansas’ Kiowa County, wrote in an email. “During an outbreak, we have two key roles: monitoring and assisting those who are ill, and taking steps to prevent the spread of the disease.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000l3b6m3on3fzzr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say it’s important to have a complete epidemiological picture during an outbreak – especially with measles, because it is so contagious.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000m3b6m5181dbnp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One person can infect over a dozen others if everyone is susceptible, so it’s really important to understand the epidemiology of who is infecting who, what potential contact locations might have happened, and where there could have been unknown transmission events,” said Dr. Nina Masters, a senior research scientist at the health care analytics company Truveta and former CDC epidemiologist who has responded to a number of measles outbreaks. “Because it’s an airborne pathogen and can stay in the air for two hours after someone leaves a room, it can be very hard at first glance to identify what those contact points might be” without investigation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000n3b6me85oxz6v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And many are raising the alarm that the ongoing outbreak may be significantly bigger than official case counts suggest.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000o3b6m7byzfwd8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My understanding is that there are many, many, many more cases than are being reported,” said Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious diseases physician in New York City and author of a book warning about the resurgence of measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000p3b6m4nq4a2n5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At least 631 measles cases have been reported in the US since the start of the year, according to a CNN tally using data from the CDC and state health departments. There have been dozens of hospitalizations, and two children have died.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000q3b6mwb0rta6f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, at least 1 in every 1,000 children who become infected with measles may die. At that rate, there are probably now at least twice as many cases as have been reported – and perhaps thousands more.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000r3b6mkdff1kwp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that the confirmed case numbers that we see are a lower bound,” Ratner said. “They’re almost certainly an underestimate of the actual number of cases, and the fact that we’ve seen two pediatric deaths already makes me worry that there are potentially many more cases than we know of.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000t3b6m0h7jrr78@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The MMR vaccine is highly effective, with one dose offering 93% protection against measles and a second shot raising it to 97%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000u3b6mor4eyvjd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But messaging around the importance of the vaccine – and the severity of the situation, in general – has been highly disjointed among various leaders.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000v3b6mru5mg7vd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There has to be an absolutely clear and unambiguous and repeated message to families that what they should do is get their children vaccinated. And we haven’t seen that,” Ratner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000w3b6mazadplwa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In February, the Texas Department of Health Services declared Gaines County to be a designated measles outbreak area, invoking &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/Admin-Meales/doc/measles-vaccination-pep-recommendations.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;new vaccination guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. Infants ages 6 months to 11 months are recommended to immediately get an early dose of the MMR vaccine, with two other doses following the regular vaccination schedule: one between 12 to 15 months and one between 4 and 6 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000x3b6m7a20yvyh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Children ages 1 to 4 who have received a dose should get their next MMR dose immediately, as long as it’s 28 days after their first one, according to the guidelines. Children who have had no shots should also get two MMR doses 28 days apart.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000y3b6maaeyy82y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By Monday, the state health department had expanded the designated measles outbreak area to include 10 counties.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000z3b6mmsm3q19l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Increasing MMR coverage is a statewide priority. DSHS encourages all eligible individuals to be up to date on MMR vaccination to limit and prevent measles outbreaks,” the agency said in a health alert.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk00103b6mfpsmazhy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2019, the worst year for measles since it was declared eliminated in the US a quarter-century ago, health officials also recommended early doses of the MMR vaccine for infants – and a new &lt;a href="https://www.truveta.com/blog/research/research-insights/first-time-measles-vaccination-trends-us-children-under-24-months/" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from Truveta says that there was a bump in vaccinations that year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk00113b6mygs9kacf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It shows a positive signal that parents are listening to their providers. They are listening to public health. They’re aware of these travel-based recommendations,” Masters said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk00123b6mb8wj67jh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Kennedy’s stance on the MMR vaccine and his messaging around it have been mixed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk00133b6mfhnepsck@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In March, he wrote in an &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/02/health/measles-rfk-vaccines/index.html"&gt;opinion piece&lt;/a&gt; in Fox News that “the decision to vaccinate is a personal one.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk00143b6mow8g7bre@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons,” he wrote, and parents should consult with health-care providers “to understand their options to get the MMR vaccine” for their children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk00153b6mrzjstpfq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Sunday, after the death of a second unvaccinated school-age child, Kennedy arrived in West Texas “quietly to console the families and to be with the community in their moment of grief,” according to a social media post. In the same post, he wrote that “The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk00163b6m8b4ojup2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But many experts stress the importance of more direct messaging.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk00173b6muef2dtd5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He still hasn’t said the thing he should say, which is that parents should get their children vaccinated,” Ratner said, and this is more concerning as Kennedy touts the use of vitamin A and the other &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/health/kennedy-measles-texas-doctor-treatment/index.html"&gt;unconventional therapies&lt;/a&gt; for measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk00183b6mlsia98o4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Kennedy is in a position now where people take his words seriously, and he is in over his head. This is not an area in which he has expertise, and the things that he says can be dangerous,” Ratner said, citing reports&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;of children with &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/health/texas-measles-vitamin-a-toxicity/index.html"&gt;liver toxicity&lt;/a&gt; from too much vitamin A.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk00193b6mqjb2vz76@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Many people have interpreted his comments to mean that people should use vitamin A to prevent measles. It does not work for that. We do sometimes give vitamin A to children who already have measles, but vitamin A is not the thing that you should be talking about to stop a measles outbreak,” he said. “The thing that stops a measles outbreak is vaccination, which is also the thing that prevents the measles outbreak from happening in the first place.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk001a3b6mxv4extoe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In March, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/31/health/cdc-measles-forecast-propublica/index.html"&gt;buried a measles forecast&lt;/a&gt; that stressed the need for vaccinations, according to internal records reviewed by ProPublica. Leaders ordered staff to not release an expert assessment that found that the risk of catching measles is high in areas near outbreaks where vaccination rates are lagging, ProPublica reported.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk001b3b6m8995vft3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And on Sunday, President Donald Trump downplayed the size of the outbreak and the need for action.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk001c3b6mncqpb969@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s so far a fairly small number of people relative to what we’re talking about,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk001d3b6mze9s8y66@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is not something new,” he said. “And we’ll see what happens, but certainly, if it progresses, we’ll have to take action very strongly.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk001e3b6mdbaltgwj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The key elements of a successful outbreak response for measles include case identification and investigation, isolating cases and quarantining those with possible exposure, and supporting vaccination, as well as post-exposure prophylaxis, Masters said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk001f3b6mu99rjbe1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the “backbone” of ensuring that it all works well is trust, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk001g3b6mjatfgjla@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If communities lose that trust in public health, in their health departments, in science, in institutions, it just makes it that much harder for the teams on the ground, for the state and local health departments, for the physicians, for everyone involved in this response,” Masters said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;An endorsement of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has provoked an angry outcry from anti-vaccine activists.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine," Kennedy said in the third paragraph of &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414" target="_blank"&gt;a lengthy post&lt;/a&gt; on the social media platform X. Kennedy made the post following meetings on Sunday in Gaines County, Texas with the families of two children who &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/07/nx-s1-5354181/second-child-dies-from-measles-in-texas-as-outbreak-spreads" target="_blank"&gt;have died&lt;/a&gt; of measles during a recent outbreak in the state. He also said he had instructed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to "supply pharmacies and Texas run clinics with needed MMR vaccines," along with other medical supplies.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy's endorsement is in line with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;all available scientific evidence&lt;/a&gt; on the MMR vaccine. "A single dose is roughly 93% effective at preventing illness, and the second dose gets that up to 97%," says Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia. According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, just 10 of the 481 measles cases recorded &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;as of April 4&lt;/a&gt; were in partially or fully vaccinated individuals — that's around 2% of all overall cases. So far three unvaccinated people, the two children in Texas and &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/alert/2025/3/?view=2188" target="_blank"&gt;an adult&lt;/a&gt; in New Mexico, have died from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm delighted to hear what Secretary Kennedy has said about giving the vaccination," says Dr. Kathryn Edwards, a retired professor of pediatric infectious disease. Edwards said she'd hoped for an explicit endorsement of the vaccine much earlier in January but that "it's better late than never."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Kennedy's suggestion that the vaccine was effective infuriated several members of the anti-vaccine community who responded on X to the statement.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Anti-vaccine anger&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm sorry, but there is no defense for this poorly worded statement," wrote Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, a prominent anti-vaccine activist who &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/02/14/1077689734/as-state-medical-boards-try-to-stamp-out-covid-misinformation-some-in-gop-push-b" target="_blank"&gt;once claimed&lt;/a&gt; during a legislative hearing in Ohio that the COVID vaccine could cause patients &lt;a href="https://x.com/Tylerjoelb/status/1402288748575002632" target="_blank"&gt;to become magnetized&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to stick "spoons and forks" all over their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Del Bigtree, a prominent anti-vaccine activist who supported Kennedy's presidential run and recently co-founded a non-profit with him called MAHA Action, also questioned the health secretary's endorsement. Bigtree suggested that Kennedy's post had "got cut off." He then went on to make unproven claims about vaccines and autism, and linked to a documentary he had made on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We voted for challenging the medical establishment, not endorsing it," &lt;a href="https://x.com/MdBreathe/status/1909059321326973356" target="_blank"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; Dr. Mary Talley Bowden, a Texas-based physician who has opposed COVID vaccines and is currently fighting a complaint from Texas's medical board over hospital admitting privileges. Bowden says the complaint is related to her prescribing patients ivermectin. Ivermectin is an unproven &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/30/1089809588/ivermectin-covid-treatment-brazil-study" target="_blank"&gt;alternative therapy&lt;/a&gt; for COVID.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Kennedy was one of those candidates that attracted people who might not vote for Trump," Bowden told NPR in an interview. Much of the attraction was from people who were "very fed up with what happened during the pandemic," she says. "Neither Biden or Trump were willing to even talk about the pandemic, and Kennedy was," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-58795" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;She says that Kennedy's decision to endorse the MMR vaccine to control the outbreak reminds her of the heavy-handed response to COVID.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Do we need to make a proclamation, 'Ok, this is what needs to be done'?" she says. "That's what rubs me the wrong way."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy's statement also contradicts years of his own vaccine skepticism. The health secretary &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/03/nx-s1-5198506/rfk-jr-anti-vaccine-chd-lawsuits" target="_blank"&gt;formerly chaired&lt;/a&gt; an anti-vaccine non-profit called Children's Health Defense that, during a measles outbreak in 2019, tried to sue New York over the state's school vaccine requirement. It ultimately lost the case. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2023, during &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/1999-robert-kennedy-jr/id360084272?i=1000644538873" target="_blank"&gt;an interview&lt;/a&gt; with the popular podcaster Joe Rogan, Kennedy denied that the measles vaccine had led to a drop in deaths. He claimed that malnutrition was the root cause of measles deaths, and that by the time the vaccine debuted in 1963, mortality was already low. The few deaths that did occur "were all kids in the Mississippi Delta, black kids, severely malnourished, and they were dying of measles," he told Rogan. Kennedy did not cite any evidence for that claim.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In his new role, the health secretary has occasionally acknowledged the efficacy of the MMR shot. "Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons," he wrote &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" target="_blank"&gt;in an op-ed&lt;/a&gt; on Fox News on March 2. But in the same post, Kennedy claimed vitamin A can "dramatically reduce measles mortality." Offit says vitamin A does not affect the disease course in developed nations like the United States, and that it can damage children's livers in large doses. Texas Public Media reported that several children in West Texas &lt;a href="https://www.tpr.org/public-health/2025-03-27/west-texas-children-treated-for-vitamin-a-toxicity-as-medical-disinformation-spreads-alongside-measles-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;were hospitalized&lt;/a&gt; with vitamin A toxicity following his Fox News statement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Alternative Therapies&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was unclear why Kennedy chose this moment to explicitly endorse the MMR shot. The Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to NPR's request for a comment. In &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1909049021211263268" target="_blank"&gt;a second post&lt;/a&gt; later Sunday evening, Kennedy posted pictures posing with the families of those who had lost children, and promoted two therapies, "aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Budesonide is an inhaled steroid used to treat asthma and has "no role in measles," Offit says. Clarithromycin is an oral antibiotic, but Offit says it's the wrong kind of antibiotic for treating secondary bacterial infections caused by measles. "Both of those things are valueless," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Offit says that, despite Kennedy's online endorsement, he expects the measles outbreak to continue and possibly worsen. "This is a massive outbreak that is not being controlled," Offit says. Measles was eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, but it is killing children again. "I have never been more upset; it's just so hard to watch this."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NPR's Selena Simons-Duffin and Rob Stein contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers observed plasticity in thalamic neurons in response to visual experiences, independent of the cortex—an unexpected finding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes, especially pronounced during development but also present in adults, may offer a new target for treating neurodevelopmental disorders. By focusing on the thalamus, therapies could influence brain-wide connectivity more efficiently and potentially enhance cognitive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent Plasticity:&lt;/strong&gt; The thalamus can rewire its own connections without input from the cortex.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developmental Sensitivity:&lt;/strong&gt; Thalamic plasticity is most prominent early in life but still possible in adulthood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting thalamic neuromodulators may help treat conditions like autism by altering sensory processing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Boston Children’s Hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Years ago, as a neurology resident, Chinfei Chen, MD, PhD, cared for a 20-year-old woman who had experienced a very small stroke, affecting only the thalamus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was so tiny that she wouldn’t have noticed any symptoms had the stroke been in any other area of the brain,” says Chen, who is now an investigator at the F.M.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Located deep in the brain, the thalamus is the brain’s central relay hub, receiving information from the outside world and transmitting it to many areas of the cortex. Perhaps because it’s harder to access, it’s been underexplored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Chen thinks the thalamus is critical to cognitive function, especially during early development when brain connections are first forming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuronal connections — and the ability to update them as needed — have mainly been studied at the cortex level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study just published in the journal&lt;em&gt; Neuron&lt;/em&gt;, Chen and her colleagues show that the thalamus can update its own connections, independently of the cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Studying connections in the thalamus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newer technologies that can selectively activate and monitor cells are now affording a better glimpse of the thalamus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s been an explosion of studies of smaller and deeper brain areas that were not well studied before,” says Takuma Sonoda, PhD, in the Chen Lab, the study’s first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers placed mice in a controlled visual environment, presenting them with horizontal lines moving in different directions (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then recorded the activity of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the part of the thalamus that relays visual information to the visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recordings showed that cell populations within the LGN changed their response patterns based on the animals’ visual experience. This finding was unexpected as plasticity, the ability of neuronal connections to change, has traditionally been attributed to the cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Providing different experiences can change the connectivity of the thalamus, and these changes in connectivity can be long-lasting,” explains Chen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was especially true during development, but we also saw plasticity in adult mice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the circuits that changed were those connecting the retina to thalamus, &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;those connecting the cortex to thalamus— evidence that the thalamus was rewiring.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new angle on neurodevelopmental disorders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chen believes her team’s findings are relevant to children with neurodevelopmental disorders, which often involve altered brain connections. Some therapies — such as repetitively exposing children with autism to different situations to get them accustomed to them — may be changing these connections, strengthening certain pathways over others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you want to alter connectivity across many cortical areas, it may be beneficial to intervene at the level of the thalamus, before signals are broadcast throughout the brain,” says Chen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She suggests that one way to influence connectivity in the thalamus is by modulating neurotransmitters, using existing drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Neuromodulators could alter the processing of sensory information including visual processing, which can be affected in neurodevelopmental disorders,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of studies are looking at expression patterns of neuromodulatory receptors on thalamic neurons, and it’s possible we could find pharmaceuticals that are more specific to the thalamus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thalamus may also be a more strategic target to focus on in improving cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you could change connectivity in the thalamus before information is transmitted throughout the rest of the brain, you could target one place rather than multiple areas of the brain. The thalamus is a very key area of the brain that shouldn’t be neglected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroplasticity and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3852575d54545d1642594b54574f785b5051545c4a5d564b1650594a4e594a5c165d5c4d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Joelle Zaslow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://childrens.harvard.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Boston Children’s Hospital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Joelle Zaslow – Boston Children’s Hospital&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2025.02.023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Experience influences the refinement of feature selectivity in the mouse primary visual thalamus&lt;/a&gt;” by Chinfei Chen, et al. &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience influences the refinement of feature selectivity in the mouse primary visual thalamus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurons exhibit selectivity for specific features: a property essential for extracting and encoding relevant information in the environment.

Kennedy Jr. on February 25, 2025. (Photo by Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For vaccine opponents, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s appointment as secretary of health and human services represented something close to nirvana. It was a chance, finally, to take on Big Pharma and to bring their long-stigmatized beliefs into the political mainstream. Perhaps no one in the country has done more than Kennedy to convince people not to vaccinate themselves or their children. Now, he was going to be in charge of the country’s vaccine programs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those dreams came crashing down Sunday afternoon, when Kennedy visited the family of the second child to die in the Texas measles outbreak for a trip that was billed as an effort to better understand the federal response to the disease. Buried near the bottom of an X post about his visit, Kennedy &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414" rel&gt;conceded&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that the measles vaccine is “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles.” He also said the government was providing “needed MMR vaccines.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That statement went off like a bomb in MAHA-land, where it’s taken as scripture that basic sanitation and vitamin A are the real way to avoid measles, which (they add) isn’t that serious of a disease anyway. The replies to Kennedy’s tweet filled up with former supporters, prominent and not, who thought he had made a grievous error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There is no defense for this poorly worded statement,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/BusyDrT/status/1909006120297124009" rel&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Sherri Tenpenny, a prominent anti-vaccine activist who has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.36YX9NM" rel&gt;called&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; concern about the measles outbreak “hysteria.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kennedy has a long history of criticizing the measles vaccine, which—to be abundantly clear—is empirically effective and may well constitute one of the great medical breakthroughs of the twentieth century. He said in a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/SenseReceptor/status/1896700481579204635" rel&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; recently released by his Children’s Health Defense group that it’s possible the measles vaccine is causing more deaths than measles itself. He’s been &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/opinion/rfk-jr-vaccines-samoa-measles.html" rel&gt;blamed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for fueling anti-MMR vaccine sentiments in Samoa &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/how-rfk-jr-falsely-denied-his-connection-to-a-deadly-measles-outbreak-in-samoa/" rel&gt;before and during&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a fall 2019 measles outbreak that ended up killing 83 people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As recently as last month, Kennedy did an interview with Fox News’s Sean Hannity at a Steak 'n Shake where he &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/wheres-the-beef-tallow" rel&gt;expounded&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; on the supposed dangers of the measles vaccine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Still, Kennedy’s supporters were already &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/03/rfks-flip-flop-on-the-measles-shot-is-ripping-the-anti-vax-world-apart/" rel&gt;growing restless&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in early March, when he wrote an op-ed amid the measles outbreak saying the vaccine should be available to people who want it. Given his previous claims that the vaccine was actually harmful, they wondered, why would he now want to make it available?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Others groped for conspiracy theories to defend Kennedy. Kim Iversen, a former host of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hill&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;’s daily talk show, speculated on her own show in March that nefarious forces were deliberately spreading the measles in Texas to make Kennedy look bad.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Did somebody go and release measles?” she &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://rumble.com/v6q2vkk-shocked-betrayed-rfk-jr.-flips-on-measles-vaccine-nato-trap-europe-could-dr.html" rel&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As early as December 2024, Dr. Mary Bowden, a Houston doctor who was &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/suspended-texas-doctor-promoted-ivermectin-covid-treatment-resigns-hos-rcna5833" rel&gt;suspended&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from her job for pushing COVID-19 misinformation, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/TheRiftTV/status/1908261647002591606" rel&gt;complained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; on a podcast that Kennedy was ditching attacks on vaccines for the more politically palatable, blander “Make America Healthy Again” movement. She and other anti-vaccine activists worried that he and the incoming Trump administration would be more preoccupied with eliminating “Red Dye no. 4” and seed oils from the food supply than on going after vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“He’s our nuclear bomb—we’re in World War III, he’s going to take down Japan,” Bowden said in the podcast interview. “All of a sudden, the nuclear bomb—the target has shifted to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;food&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fury has only grown now that Kennedy managed to eke out one wholly positive statement about vaccines—whether because of bad press or because the death of a second child during the outbreak brought about his Damascene conversion. Former One America News host Liz Wheeler, whose YouTube channel has more than 400,000 subscribers, accused Kennedy of no longer being “based.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“What on earth is going on with Bobby Kennedy,” Wheeler &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/Liz_Wheeler/status/1909078816007536827" rel&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in a post on X. “We voted for based. We didn’t vote for ‘needed MMR vaccines.’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This brewing discontent with Kennedy among the MAHA faithful is also one of the forces behind the obviously fake but increasingly popular “RFK blackmail” conspiracy theory I &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/when-owning-the-libs-matters-more-than-the-constitution-trump-third-term-maga-republicans-daily-wire" rel&gt;touched on last week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. In this telling, Kennedy only stopped being “based” because someone—presumably Israel—is blackmailing him with some unspecified but damaging material.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is flimsy stuff even by the standards of these conspiracy theories—but if Kennedy continues to acknowledge the reality of the measles outbreak and the value of vaccines, I think it’ll become even more popular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/subscribe?coupon=5e5ef02e&amp;amp;utm_content=160810591","text":"Get 30 day free trial","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"&gt;&lt;a class="button primary" href="https://www.thebulwark.com/subscribe?coupon=5e5ef02e&amp;amp;utm_content=160810591" rel&gt;&lt;span&gt;Get 30 day free trial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="captioned-image-container"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff79dd5c-73c8-497d-aae5-f3859757e421_4475x2983.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="image-caption"&gt;Virginia Lt.

Mothers who faced early trauma were more likely to have children who reported similar experiences and to exhibit traits of neurodevelopmental conditions themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No such link was found for fathers, possibly due to differing caregiving roles or underrepresentation in the study.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study examines the association between parents’ adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and children with neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD and autism. These ACEs include abuse, neglect, and familial dysfunction, which can lead to long-term trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results have been published in the &lt;em&gt;Nordic Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mother of the child&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 86 mothers and 37 fathers, along with 48 children diagnosed with ADHD, autism, or both, recruited from two psychiatric clinics in Sweden. Mothers who experienced difficult circumstances in childhood were more likely to have children who reported similar experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, these mothers had an increased risk of having traits of ADHD and autism themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If a mother has grown up in an unsafe environment, this can affect the way she manages stress, provides security, and builds intimate relationships with her child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This, in turn, can make it more difficult for the child to regulate their emotions and deal with everyday challenges, especially if the child has a neurodevelopmental disorder,” says Maria Davidsson, doctoral student at Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg affiliated with the university’s Gillberg Neuropsychiatry Centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For fathers, on the other hand, no such association was seen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we can’t say why this link is only seen with mothers, perhaps it could be due to the mother more often having an intimate caring relationship with her children. It could also be that the fathers’ childhood experiences affect the children in other ways without any direct link to their mental health,” says Maria Davidsson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possible reason why the same association was not seen with the children’s fathers could be that fewer fathers participated in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider the bigger picture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers say it is important to consider the bigger picture when assessing children with ADHD and autism. Looking into the parents’ childhood experiences, such as via ACE screening, can help provide a better understanding of how early experiences impact child development and the family’s need for support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Neurodevelopmental problems rarely occur alone. Instead, they’re often linked to other factors, making it important to consider the entire context in assessments and interventions alike,” says Maria Davidsson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this ASD, ADHD, and childhood trauma research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e29290879191a291838a8e8590878c918983cc8597cc9187" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Elin Lindström&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://gu.se" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Elin Lindström – University of Gothenburg&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08039488.2025.2469737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Adverse childhood experiences in children with neurodevelopmental disorders and their parents&lt;/a&gt;” by Maria Davidsson et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nordic Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adverse childhood experiences in children with neurodevelopmental disorders and their parents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="d1e176"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are potentially traumatic events associated with negative health outcomes. Children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) are at increased risk of ACEs, however, research on ACEs in children with NDD and their parents, and its possible relation to child problems, is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We aimed to explore the association between ACEs in parents and children; if there is an association between parental ACEs and NDD traits, and if ACEs in parents or children are associated with the child’s emotional behavioral problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="d1e179"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 86 mothers, 37 fathers, and 48 children diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and/or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), recruited from two child psychiatric clinics in Sweden. Parents provided demographic information and reported their own ACEs, NDD traits, and their children’s emotional and behavioral problems. Children responded to measure of ACEs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="d1e182"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maternal ACEs were significantly correlated with child ACEs (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.382, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.034), as well as with maternal ADHD traits (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.451, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and ASD traits (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.451, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Child ACEs also correlated with child emotional problems (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.304, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.038). Regression analysis revealed a relationship between maternal ACEs and child emotional and behavioral problems (&lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt; = 0.511, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.036). None of these associations were found in fathers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="d1e217"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study highlights the need for ACE screenings in evaluations of children with ADHD/ASD and suggests clinicians to consider maternal trauma and maternal NDD traits.

suggests there is a way to counteract the dangerous tiny particles — by eating any 'deeply colored fruit or vegetable'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a review of 89 studies, they said certain foods — such as black beans and blueberries — contained anthocyanins, a powerful antioxidant behind dark blue, red, purple or black pigments in fruits and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anthocyanins act as antioxidants in the body, they said, removing free radicals — volatile molecules — that can be released by microplastics and damage cells in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reviewing the research, Dr Angelo Falcone — an integrative medicine physician who was not involved in the research — told &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.foodandwine.com/anthocyanins-fruits-vegetables-microplastics-11709874"&gt;Food and Wine&lt;/a&gt;: 'The general rule is, the deeper and more vibrant the purple, blue or red color, the higher the anthocyanin content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Berries are superstars, particularly blueberries, blackberries, cranberries, raspberries, and bilberries, but other excellent sources include black rice, purple corn, red cabbage, purple sweet potatoes, red grapes, pomegranates and acai berries'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts suggested that deeply colored fruits and vegetables could help to limit damage to the body from microplastics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anthocyanins are water-soluble antioxidants responsible for fruits' and vegetables' deep hues, such as reds, purples, blues and blacks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;These antioxidants are capable of neutralizing free radicals released by microplastics — limiting their damage to the body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Free radicals released by microplastics can enter cells and cause damage to DNA or other cell structures, which may trigger a rise in inflammation levels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Microplastics enter the body either directly by consuming foods that are contaminated with them or through the skin via contact where they travel into the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once in, they enter cells where they can damage DNA and disrupt hormones — raising levels of inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say microplastics are a source of oxidative stress, or an imbalance of free radicals in the body linked to cell damage and chronic illnesses like heart disease, as well as hormone imbalances and fertility problems in both men and women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To reduce microplastics levels in the body, experts recommend&lt;span&gt; purchasing fewer foods in plastic packaging, not using or reheating food in plastic containers, limiting the use of single-use plastics like cutlery and avoiding plastic kitchen tools like cutting boards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fruits and vegetables are already recommended as a way to limit damage to the body because of their high antioxidant content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in the review, published in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9952726/"&gt;Journal of Pharmaceutical Analysis&lt;/a&gt; — and first reported by &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.foodandwine.com/anthocyanins-fruits-vegetables-microplastics-11709874"&gt;Food and Wine &lt;/a&gt;— researchers have now suggested certain foods can also help to limit damage to the body from microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anthocyanins are present in many fruits and vegetables, particularly those with red, purple and blue colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists say the deeper the color of a fruit or vegetable, the more anthocyanins they likely contain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Showing how anthocyanins could help, the Chinese scientists cited a 2022 study on rats who had ulcerative colitis, a chronic intestinal disease that causes rectal bleeding, anemia and severe dehydration among other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the paper, the rats were fed a supplement of&lt;span&gt; Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), an anthocyanin common in black rice and black beans, and had their sperm count and testicular health tracked. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed that by the end of the weeks-long study, the rats had boosted sperm counts and reduced testicular damage — which the reviewers said suggested anthocyanins had improved their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another paper from 2023 that they cited, researchers monitored cells in a lab that made testosterone.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each cell was exposed to a substance that mimics free radicals thought to be released by microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Microplastics are unavoidable in the modern world, and may have found their way into almost everything we eat and drink&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were then exposed to four different anthocyanins, with results showing the cells then had reduced oxidative stress and better testosterone production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, cyanidin-3,5-diglucoside (C-3,5-G) — found in pomegranates and red apples among others — was found to be the most potent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also reviewed studies they said suggested anthocyanins boosted female reproductive health that were both carried out in animals and in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn't clear how much anthocyanin someone needs to consume to get the benefits, but previous research has suggested it is about 50 milligrams per day — equivalent to one cup of blueberries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All of the research included in the study was carried out in the lab or in mice, suggesting further research is needed in humans to assess whether these can help to reduce suspected damage from microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nonetheless, fruits and vegetables are considered a cornerstone of a healthy diet because of the nutrients, fiber and antioxidants that they contain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Current US dietary guidelines recommend that Americans consume five-a-day — typically two fruits and three vegetables daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 20:09:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQd3dPTFBKUHlHVXE5TjVIbUtScWNsRjh1MnpidXJySEhwZmt2cHNWZFdWX0JZVGJxM0NkM1lUWENWNGRnX2xaNlhlRnNnZjF0UksxLUV4aF9QeE1JMlpIaFhvQVVzdjd4ejJuWGROdGZjZERtQUVpclNqdFZLcC1nRWhHbWlMbXhFdkhRRDVJN0w3SHVPanM3SnNiRzVSVmJ6dlVPRmg5QVLSAa4BQVVfeXFMT1BhR2FXVFozOUVIM19GaDdDQUVFZmI2R0ZISGxxU2ZFZzRTS1FVUnVUQ1BFUW9lVzhMR3lDaENfTlpjRVhvSmJla01vWXZpdGNRVlJRSzdKTXF4Xzl3OUdVbWJRQXowNGI5UUZCLWlGTGhlTV8yNnJJdlFxNlg2QVFLZ1lMaFZ5TDJUNDM5dFNrRlFzbGR0S3R2RFdqS1B0V2RibzF5LW1fdnBURkFR</guid></item><item><title>4:3 intermittent fasting beats calorie counting for weight loss - The Brighter Side of News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPM1VadFFwa0lkc1U2Ty1fNkd6dTJkM1ZETXAtanc4WjJVei0zRzhIZEhxakVEZHd3VTdIcmdnM3lrYXYtekdwTGdkRU1BdjN4TDZMYnhDZ2lITnR5LUlnaDJUTW1LRUtNS1NfUmllamhrOG1GYzREU0hyRGRoRmxnbktFSDN3WTV6aWJNQkdKSXA1YjFySzFRXzZKa3RwNnZobnQ0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiBox-root css-a9h2n1" data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks"&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the search for sustainable weight loss, one diet strategy is starting to stand out from the rest.

In contrast, the daily calorie group followed a strict plan that cut daily intake by 34%, requiring participants to count calories and follow a diet that included 55% carbs, 15% protein, and 30% fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of 12 months, participants in the 4:3 group had lost an average of 7.6% of their body weight, compared to a 5% loss in the DCR group.

These are important risk factors for heart disease and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Victoria Catenacci, MD, one of the study's lead authors and a specialist in obesity medicine, said the findings were both surprising and hopeful. “It was exciting to see that this method led to better outcomes,” she explained. “This is a strategy backed by evidence, especially for people who find daily calorie counting hard to stick with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her co-lead author, Dr. Danielle Ostendorf, agreed. Now a researcher at the &lt;a href="https://www.utk.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Tennessee Knoxville&lt;/a&gt;, she emphasized the value of this method for real-world use. “The 4:3 approach might be the sweet spot,” she said. “It's flexible enough for people to live their normal lives but strict enough to create a real calorie deficit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="why_4_3_works_when_others_don_t"&gt;Why 4:3 Works When Others Don’t&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study stands out because it matched the calorie deficit between both groups—something most similar studies haven't done. Whether participants restricted calories three days a week or every day, they were expected to cut their weekly intake by roughly 34%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Dr. Danielle Ostendorf, researcher at the University of Tennessee Knoxville. (CREDIT: University of Tennessee Knoxville) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That made the results even more meaningful. Previous studies using other fasting methods—like the 5:2 plan (fasting two days per week) or alternate-day fasting—didn’t show better weight loss than traditional diets. But this time was different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ostendorf explained why 4:3 might hit the right balance. “Two fast days a week might not be enough to cause big &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/major-study-reveals-how-time-restricted-eating-affects-weight-loss/"&gt;weight changes&lt;/a&gt;,” she said. “But fasting every other day can be too hard. With 4:3, it’s flexible and easier to follow over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The numbers support her view. While 47% of people in the calorie-counting group reached the 5% weight loss target considered clinically meaningful, 58% of the fasting group hit that goal. That’s a big deal when you consider the long-term health benefits tied to just a 5% drop in weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="better_adherence_lower_dropout"&gt;Better Adherence, Lower Dropout&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest surprises in the study was that people in the 4:3 fasting group not only ate fewer calories, they also stuck with the program longer. Using a scientific method called the doubly labeled water technique, the researchers tracked actual calorie intake based on how participants’ bodies processed hydrogen and oxygen isotopes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the 4:3 group followed the diet more closely than those in the DCR group, despite having the same target energy deficit. That translated into lower dropout rates: only 19% of the fasting group quit the study by the one-year mark, compared to 30% of the DCR group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Catenacci explained why that may be. “With fasting, you don’t have to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/eating-fewer-ultra-processed-foods-greatly-reduces-type-2-diabetes-risk/"&gt;think about food every day&lt;/a&gt;,” she said. “That may help people feel less overwhelmed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan also made room for personal flexibility. Participants could pick which three days to fast each week, adjusting around work or social plans. On those days, women aimed for 400–600 calories and men for 500–700, depending on body size. On regular eating days, there were no set limits—but a strong push toward healthy meals and portion control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="behavioral_support_was_key"&gt;Behavioral Support Was Key&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both groups had access to group-based coaching sessions led by registered dietitians. For the first 12 weeks, they met weekly. After that, the meetings were held every other week. Participants also received a free gym membership and were encouraged to exercise for 300 minutes per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/these-four-foods-can-lower-your-risk-of-tinnitus-study-finds/"&gt;behavioral components&lt;/a&gt; played a major role in the study’s success. “The support gave participants accountability and structure,” said Dr. Ostendorf. “That aligns with current clinical guidelines for obesity treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining the 4:3 fasting model with community support, fitness tools, and expert guidance, the research team created an environment that helped participants stick with their goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="looking_beyond_the_scale"&gt;Looking Beyond the Scale&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="20" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are not stopping here. They are now studying how 4:3 fasting might benefit specific groups—like breast cancer survivors, older adults, and people with chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. A pilot program with 15 breast cancer survivors has already been completed, and a new phase is starting soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="21" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They're also digging deeper into the biology behind the benefits. Stool and blood samples were collected from participants to explore changes in the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/gut-microbes-in-infancy-shape-diabetes-risk-and-metabolic-health-for-life/"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; and hormones related to hunger and metabolism. These results could help explain why the 4:3 plan works better for some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="22" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe these fasting periods may offer other metabolic advantages,” said Dr. Ostendorf. “We’re still analyzing those findings, but we suspect that adherence plays a major role.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="23" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Catenacci added that they’re seeking long-term funding to see how the 4:3 method holds up beyond one year. “Twelve months is great, but we want to know what happens over two or three years,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="making_it_accessible"&gt;Making It Accessible&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="24" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, there’s no widely available clinic or community program that offers a structured 4:3 intermittent fasting plan. That’s something Dr. Ostendorf hopes to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="25" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve had people asking how they can try this,” she said. “So now we’re thinking about how to design a low-cost program that could be offered in local clinics or online.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="26" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their vision includes making the plan easy to follow, supported by education and tools that empower people to take charge of their own health. If future research continues to support the benefits of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-discover-why-intermittent-fasting-has-anti-aging-effects/"&gt;4:3 intermittent fasting&lt;/a&gt;, this approach could soon be part of standard care for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Brighter Side of News</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 20:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPM1VadFFwa0lkc1U2Ty1fNkd6dTJkM1ZETXAtanc4WjJVei0zRzhIZEhxakVEZHd3VTdIcmdnM3lrYXYtekdwTGdkRU1BdjN4TDZMYnhDZ2lITnR5LUlnaDJUTW1LRUtNS1NfUmllamhrOG1GYzREU0hyRGRoRmxnbktFSDN3WTV6aWJNQkdKSXA1YjFySzFRXzZKa3RwNnZobnQ0</guid></item><item><title>Immune Signals Shape Social Behavior and Anxiety in the Brain - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZkFVX3lxTE03SlBrYmRDMUxHQVFnVXljYnBGS0JiZnF1WFJKbkVxdk1QcEZpVHNBZ0pEc04ybWpSdTRBMllPSGVOcjh5MU5zczQ2ZEJPaWxGeWJiZTZyOUZoSlgzSlU3ckIxdXEwdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research reveals that the immune molecule IL-17 can influence behavior by acting directly on specific regions of the brain. IL-17 reduces neuron excitability in the cortex to enhance sociability, while in the amygdala, it increases excitability and induces anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings demonstrate that cytokines can act like neuromodulators, linking immune activity to distinct emotional and social behaviors. This growing understanding of neuro-immune interaction could inform treatments for conditions like autism and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Roles of IL-17:&lt;/strong&gt; IL-17 promotes sociability in the cortex and anxiety in the amygdala.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuromodulator Behavior:&lt;/strong&gt; IL-17 acts directly on neurons, influencing excitability and behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting IL-17 pathways may offer new approaches to treat neurological disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;MIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune molecules called cytokines play important roles in the body’s defense against infection, helping to control inflammation and coordinating the responses of other immune cells. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing body of evidence suggests that some of these molecules also influence the brain, leading to behavioral changes during illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two new studies from MIT and Harvard Medical School, focused on a cytokine called IL-17, now add to that evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108439"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;During infections, this anxiety may be a beneficial response, keeping the sick individual away from others to whom the infection could spread, Choi hypothesizes. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that IL-17 acts on two distinct brain regions — the amygdala and the somatosensory cortex — to exert two divergent effects. In the amygdala, IL-17 can elicit feelings of anxiety, while in the cortex it promotes sociable behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that the immune and nervous systems are tightly interconnected, says Gloria Choi, an associate professor of brain and cognitive sciences, a member of MIT’s Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, and one of the senior authors of the studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re sick, there’s so many more things that are happening to your internal states, your mood, and your behavioral states, and that’s not simply you being fatigued physically. It has something to do with the brain,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jun Huh, an associate professor of immunology at Harvard Medical School, is also a senior author of both studies, which appear today in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;. One of the papers was led by Picower Institute Research Scientist Byeongjun Lee and former Picower Institute research scientist Jeong-Tae Kwon, and the other was led by Harvard Medical School postdoc Yunjin Lee and Picower Institute postdoc Tomoe Ishikawa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral effects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choi and Huh became interested in IL-17 several years ago, when they found it was involved in a phenomenon known as the fever effect. Large-scale studies of autistic children have found that for many of them, their behavioral symptoms temporarily diminish when they have a fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2019 study in mice, Choi and Huh showed that in some cases of infection, IL-17 is released and suppresses a small region of the brain’s cortex known as S1DZ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overactivation of neurons in this region can lead to autism-like behavioral symptoms in mice, including repetitive behaviors and reduced sociability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This molecule became a link that connects immune system activation, manifested as a fever, to changes in brain function and changes in the animals’ behavior,” Choi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IL-17 comes in six different forms, and there are five different receptors that can bind to it. In their two new papers, the researchers set out to map which of these receptors are expressed in different parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mapping revealed that a pair of receptors known as IL-17RA and IL-17RB is found in the cortex, including in the S1DZ region that the researchers had previously identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The receptors are located in a population of neurons that receive proprioceptive input and are involved in controlling behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a type of IL-17 known as IL-17E binds to these receptors, the neurons become less excitable, which leads to the behavioral effects seen in the 2019 study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“IL-17E, which we’ve shown to be necessary for behavioral mitigation, actually does act almost exactly like a neuromodulator in that it will immediately reduce these neurons’ excitability,” Choi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, there is an immune molecule that’s acting as a neuromodulator in the brain, and its main function is to regulate excitability of neurons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choi hypothesizes that IL-17 may have originally evolved as a neuromodulator, and later on was appropriated by the immune system to play a role in promoting inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That idea is consistent with previous work showing that in the worm &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt;, IL-17 has no role in the immune system but instead acts on neurons. Among its effects in worms, IL-17 promotes aggregation, a form of social behavior. Additionally, in mammals, IL-17E is actually made by neurons in the cortex, including S1DZ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a possibility that a couple of forms of IL-17 perhaps evolved first and foremost to act as a neuromodulator in the brain, and maybe later were hijacked by the immune system also to act as immune modulators,” Choi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provoking anxiety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the other &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt; paper, the researchers explored another brain location where they found IL-17 receptors — the amygdala. This almond-shaped structure plays an important role in processing emotions, including fear and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That study revealed that in a region known as the basolateral amygdala (BLA), the IL-17RA and IL-17RE receptors, which work as a pair, are expressed in a discrete population of neurons. When these receptors bind to IL-17A and IL-17C, the neurons become more excitable, leading to an increase in anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that, counterintuitively, if animals are treated with antibodies that block IL-17 receptors, it actually increases the amount of IL-17C circulating in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding may help to explain unexpected outcomes observed in a clinical trial of a drug targeting the IL-17-RA receptor for psoriasis treatment, particularly regarding its potential adverse effects on mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hypothesize that there’s a possibility that the IL-17 ligand that is upregulated in this patient cohort might act on the brain to induce suicide ideation, while in animals there is an anxiogenic phenotype,” Choi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During infections, this anxiety may be a beneficial response, keeping the sick individual away from others to whom the infection could spread, Choi hypothesizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Other than its main function of fighting pathogens, one of the ways that the immune system works is to control the host behavior, to protect the host itself and also protect the community the host belongs to,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the ways the immune system is doing that is to use cytokines, secreted factors, to go to the brain as communication tools.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the same BLA neurons that have receptors for IL-17 also have receptors for IL-10, a cytokine that suppresses inflammation. This molecule counteracts the excitability generated by IL-17, giving the body a way to shut off anxiety once it’s no longer useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinctive behaviors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the two studies suggest that the immune system, and even a single family of cytokines, can exert a variety of effects in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have now different combinations of IL-17 receptors being expressed in different populations of neurons, in two different brain regions, that regulate very distinct behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One is actually somewhat positive and enhances social behaviors, and another is somewhat negative and induces anxiogenic phenotypes,” Choi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her lab is now working on additional mapping of IL-17 receptor locations, as well as the IL-17 molecules that bind to them, focusing on the S1DZ region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, a better understanding of these neuro-immune interactions may help researchers develop new treatments for neurological conditions such as autism or depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that these molecules are made by the immune system gives us a novel approach to influence brain function as means of therapeutics,” Choi says. “Instead of thinking about directly going for the brain, can we think about doing something to the immune system?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded, in part, by Jeongho Kim and the Brain Impact Foundation Neuro-Immune Fund, the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative, the Simons Center for the Social Brain, the Marcus Foundation, the N of One: Autism Research Foundation, the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, the Picower Institute Innovation Fund, the MIT John W.

Researchers recorded brain activity while participants completed a simple, low-effort learning task based on probability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, participants who let their minds drift performed just as well—if not better—than when fully focused. This suggests that passive states of mind, similar to sleep-like neural activity, can support certain types of unconscious learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passive Learning Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Mind wandering didn’t harm performance and sometimes improved learning in low-attention tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Activity Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep-like cortical oscillations were associated with better task performance during mind wandering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spontaneity Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Spontaneous mind wandering was more beneficial than deliberate daydreaming.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When people let their minds wander during tasks that require attention and active thinking, it can hurt how well they learn and perform the tasks. But there are more passive kinds of learning that require less attention. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Péter Simor, from Eötvös Loránd University, and colleagues explored how mind wandering influences learning in tasks requiring little attention in their &lt;em&gt;JNeurosci&lt;/em&gt; paper.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108435"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and a person." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Thus, sleep-like neural activity linked to spontaneous mind wandering promotes learning in tasks that require minimal attention.  Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 40 study participants performed a simple learning task while the researchers recorded their brain activity. This simple task was used because participants could make predictions based off probabilities that they learned without awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mind wandering while doing the task did not worsen performance, and in some cases even enhanced learning. Spontaneous mind wandering was more beneficial to learning than deliberate mind wandering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During mind wandering and improvements in task learning, oscillatory neural activity in the cortex, resembling the brain activity that occurs during sleep or sleep-like states, occurred. Thus, sleep-like neural activity linked to spontaneous mind wandering promotes learning in tasks that require minimal attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most cognitive work looks at learning when you are fully engaged. But in real life we spend so much time passively learning! As our brain needs sleep, maybe we also need passive ways of learning, or ‘wakeful rest,’ to recover from tasks that require your brain to be online and engaged,” says Simor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this learning and daydreaming research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7f121a1b161e3f0c191151100d18" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN Media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://sfn.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN Media – SfN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1421-24.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mind Wandering During Implicit Learning is Associated with Increased Periodic EEG Activity and Improved Extraction of Hidden Probabilistic Patterns&lt;/a&gt;” by Péter Simor et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind Wandering During Implicit Learning is Associated with Increased Periodic EEG Activity and Improved Extraction of Hidden Probabilistic Patterns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mind wandering, occupying 30-50% of our waking time, remains an enigmatic phenomenon in cognitive neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large number of studies showed a negative association between mind wandering and attention-demanding (model-based) tasks in both natural settings and laboratory conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mind wandering, however, does not seem to be detrimental for all cognitive domains, and was observed to benefit creativity and problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We examined if mind wandering may facilitate model-free processes, such as probabilistic learning, which relies on the automatic acquisition of statistical regularities with minimal attentional demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We administered a well-established implicit probabilistic learning task combined with thought probes in healthy adults (N = 37, 30 females).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore the neural correlates of mind wandering and probabilistic learning, participants were fitted with high-density electroencephalography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that probabilistic learning was not only immune to periods of mind wandering but was positively associated with it.

These “communication highways” in the brain are essential for functions like language and mental arithmetic and are shaped by early environmental influences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using brain imaging from over 9,000 children, the researchers found that widespread white matter differences could partly explain the long-term impact of adversity.

However, certain social resiliency factors like neighborhood cohesion and positive parenting may have a protective effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results are published in &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White matter are the communication highways that allow the brain networks to carry out the necessary functions for cognition and behavior. They develop over the course of childhood, and childhood experiences may drive individual differences in how white matter matures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Sofia Carozza, PhD, and senior author Amar Dhand, MD, PhD, of the Department of Neurology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system, wanted to understand what role this process plays in cognition once children reach adolescence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The aspects of white matter that show a relationship with our early life environment are much more pervasive throughout the brain than we’d thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead of being just one or two tracts that are important for cognition, the whole brain is related to the adversities that someone might experience early in life,” said Carozza.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team studied data from 9,082 children (about half of them girls, with an average age of 9.5) collected in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study, funded by the National Institutes of Health and conducted at 21 centers across the U.S., gathered information on brain activity and structure, cognitive abilities, environment, mood and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at several categories of early environmental factors, including prenatal risk factors, interpersonal adversity, household economic deprivation, neighborhood adversity, and social resiliency factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carozza and Dhand used diffusion imaging scanning of the brain to measure fractional anisotropy (FA)—a way of estimating the integrity of the white matter connections—and streamline count, an estimate of their strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then used a computational model to compare how these features of white matter were related to both childhood environmental factors and current cognitive abilities such as language skills and mental arithmetic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their analysis revealed widespread differences in white matter connections throughout the brain depending on the children’s early-life environments. In particular, the researchers found lower quality of white matter connections in parts of the brain tied to mental arithmetic and receptive language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These white matter differences accounted for some of the relationship between adverse life experiences in early childhood and lower cognitive performance in adolescence.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are all embedded in an environment, and features of that environment such as our relationships, home life, neighborhood, or material circumstances can shape how our brains and bodies grow, which in turn affects what we can do with them,” said Carozza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We should work to make sure that more people can have those stable, healthy home lives that the brain expects, especially in childhood.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that their study is based on observational data, which means they cannot draw strong causal conclusions. Brain imaging was also only available at a single timepoint, offering a snapshot but not allowing researchers to track changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prospective studies—following children over time and collecting brain imaging information at multiple time points—would be needed to more definitively connect adversity and cognitive performance.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authorship:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to Carozza and Dhand, Mass General Brigham authors include Isaiah Kletenik.

Furthermore, white matter FA partially mediated the detrimental relationship between adversity and cognition later in adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings advance a white matter-based account of the neural and cognitive effects of adversity, which supports leading developmental theories that place interregional connectivity prior to gray matter maturation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 19:20:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE9JeElxc2xob3otZC1MQ2duTVhlWF83NFdVM2d4c3NycmVuZ29RUEU3M2YwY2NzV1FnY0pMZnJFMkZHWWxrdm9GSWQtRDQyRXRubWNrNEJGMHowU1g0VUQ5ejZGeGdnRXEzZHlWYXJncWRxM1Zaa3l4ZmpaQVRoOUk</guid></item><item><title>Common sweetener can destroy some of the most dangerous bacteria - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxQdkxMY055dDZCT2x0SE9hZXhrWVJFbXdxcVFXQ3dFaHV2NVQ0RDEzZkhxUGNYU1UxLVZLTmFub01QUklzRHZlNE5McC1fZkVkVDRwOTlRZ0FvT0ptckdvNXIxbUdVZjBDMnBoN2xMaU1wS1hJSjV1RjB4ZUt6NmkwbHlQd01mRTZ3NWs0ZlQ3V21xR1ZsZTJF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saccharin, a common artificial sweetener, may soon play a new medical role.

These bacteria often infect those with weakened immune systems and resist most antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-sweetener-destroys-bacteria"&gt;How the sweetener destroys bacteria&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In exciting work led by our team, we’ve identified a novel antimicrobial – saccharin,” Professor McCarthy said. “Saccharin breaks the walls of bacterial pathogens, causing them to distort and eventually burst, killing the bacteria.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This physical breakdown lets antibiotics enter the bacteria more easily. As a result, saccharin helps conventional drugs work better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saccharin has been used in food for over a century. It is considered safe for human consumption. Until now, though, little was known about the sweetener’s direct impact on bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dna-chaos-inside-bacterial-cells"&gt;DNA chaos: Inside bacterial cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study reveals saccharin disrupts more than bacterial walls. It also messes with DNA inside bacterial cells. Treated bacteria grow long and thin, unable to divide. Their DNA starts replicating out of control, especially away from the usual origin points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, DNA replication in bacteria starts at a site called the ori and ends at the ter. After saccharin treatment, the researchers observed far more ori and ter points than expected. This suggests multiple rounds of replication continue unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This DNA chaos may stem from saccharin triggering DNA repair processes. These repair systems start replication from damaged spots instead of the usual starting site. As a result, DNA builds up rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sweetener-weakens-bacteria-s-defense"&gt;Sweetener weakens bacteria’s defense&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saccharin also changes how &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/frogs-lead-the-way-in-developing-new-antibiotics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; maintain their outer layers. The sweetener disrupts proteins and pathways involved in making and protecting the cell envelope. This weakens the bacteria’s defense, making them easier to kill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that saccharin caused bacteria to form strange bulges. These bulges eventually burst, killing the cell. This effect mimics what happens when bacteria are exposed to powerful β-lactam antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-biofilms-and-resistant-strains"&gt;Biofilms and resistant strains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria often form biofilms – sticky layers that protect them from antibiotics. Saccharin prevents bacteria from forming these biofilms and can also break down ones that already exist. It even worked on polymicrobial biofilms, which are tougher to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saccharin increased how well antibiotics entered resistant &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cigarette-waste-fuels-antibiotic-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;em&gt;A. baumannii&lt;/em&gt;. When researchers combined saccharin with carbapenem antibiotics, the treatment became far more effective. Drug-resistant bacteria showed reduced resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-saccharin-can-treat-wounds"&gt;Saccharin can treat wounds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test real-world use, scientists embedded saccharin into hydrogels. These hydrogels were applied to burn wounds in a lab model using pig skin. The saccharin-infused gel outperformed silver-based wound dressings, cutting down bacterial infections significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Artificial sweeteners are found in many diet and sugar-free foods. We discovered that the same sweeteners you have with your coffee or in a ‘sugar-free’ drink could make some of the world’s most dangerous &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-antibiotic-found-in-soil-has-potential-to-fight-superbugs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; easier to treat,” said Professor McCarthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-fight-against-antibiotic-resistance"&gt;The fight against antibiotic resistance &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world may soon face a future where antibiotics no longer cure infections. This is because bacteria are changing and becoming stronger due to the heavy use of antibiotics in both medicine and farming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When antibiotics are used too often, bacteria learn how to fight back, making treatments less effective. At the same time, scientists aren’t discovering many new antibiotics to replace the ones that are failing. This means common infections could become serious or even deadly again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without new solutions, the growing problem of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/antibiotic-resistance-could-cause-a-health-crisis-globally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antibiotic&lt;/a&gt; resistance puts millions of lives at risk and makes routine treatments more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This has created a dangerous situation,” said Professor McCarthy. “We urgently need new drugs to treat resistant infections – and saccharin could represent a new therapeutic approach with exciting promise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/s44321-025-00219-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EMBO Molecular Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 19:09:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxQdkxMY055dDZCT2x0SE9hZXhrWVJFbXdxcVFXQ3dFaHV2NVQ0RDEzZkhxUGNYU1UxLVZLTmFub01QUklzRHZlNE5McC1fZkVkVDRwOTlRZ0FvT0ptckdvNXIxbUdVZjBDMnBoN2xMaU1wS1hJSjV1RjB4ZUt6NmkwbHlQd01mRTZ3NWs0ZlQ3V21xR1ZsZTJF</guid></item><item><title>Second child dies of measles—anti-vaccine advocate reported it before officials - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxQSy1uWVdFU3U2Qk8tZi1NLWRHcmZrcWI2OU9peEFWZlpnbGx3NkNjY1AxdHExYl9TRWhtcVlRSWZsWDk3ZEZjeXJkNU5KWER2dmdjWEZVczRabzcwRXdycUZWdXpVRG1YTDRaQzlTSllYREg3VU80Njg3Z2NIUnJ0c21Zc3B3QXdISy04bFlRZXZSTjMxcDJrMkV5TUFYRGQ5T2NjTnBqdHBIWFpVRTlVVGtySDJYR1FBd3Jn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Edwards treated the siblings of the first child who died of measles. The family sought care from Edwards for their other four children, who were also unvaccinated and fell ill from measles after their 6-year-old sibling died. Edward's involvement was revealed in an interview with the deceased child's parents, which was led by the rabid anti-vaccine organization Kennedy founded and until recently headed, Children's Health Defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/anti-vaccine-group-founded-by-rfk-jr-weaponizes-childs-measles-death/"&gt;In the interview&lt;/a&gt;, the CHD representatives, like Malone, led the parents to believe that the child's death was not from measles and that vaccines are harmful. The mother of the child concluded in the interview to deter other parents from immunizing their children against measles, despite the death of her daughter: "Don't do the shots. There [are] doctors that can help with measles. [Measles is] not as bad as they're making it out to be," she said, through a translator of low German.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message from Kennedy and these alternative practitioners has clearly impacted the communities in West Texas. Some unvaccinated children hospitalized with measles have signs of vitamin A toxicity, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/04/07/vitamin-a-poisoning-measles-rfk-jr/"&gt;doctors told The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three deaths amid an outbreak with under 600 reported measles cases are also raising questions. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, nearly 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications. Three reported deaths so far in the outbreak could be a statistical blip. But health experts are questioning whether the outbreak is much larger than known—if parents are not bringing their sick children to health providers—and/or if parents are delaying care, relying on unproven treatments, which could up the risk of life-threatening cases. The CDC also estimates that about 20 percent of US children with measles are hospitalized. With 58 hospitalizations reported so far, the percentage is about half of what's expected.&lt;/p&gt;

Among them was hair loss, which can occur as a result of nutrient or protein deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, Ms Ramirez of Fort Worth, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-a5d9ac40-13c0-11f0-93dc-d7dabae5537a" class=""&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, began taking a common over-the-counter vitamin that claimed to improve hair, skin and nail health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, soon after beginning the vitamins in late February, she began noticing yellowing of her eyes and skin.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her doctors discovered she was experiencing liver failure, which her gastroenterologist attributed to a typically innocuous ingredient called methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) in her vitamin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has found MSM to be generally benign and even protect against liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some scientists have said, however, that MSM could exacerbate liver damage in people with pre-existing liver disease, but no cases of this have been reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, Ms Ramirez has become jaundiced, with yellowing skin and eyes. She has also undergone surgery to remove her gallbladder because of hard deposits that had built up there, block the flow of bile through the liver and gallbladder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The gallbladder stores and releases the digestive fluid produced by the liver. But doctors may have to remove it if hard deposits form there, blocking the flow of bile from the liver and gallbladder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Ramirez did not say how her doctor concluded that MSM was the culprit, though supplements, which are &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-6269695/Hundreds-natural-supplements-contain-active-drugs-FDA-knows-doesnt-tell-public.html"&gt;not regulated by the FDA&lt;/a&gt;, can be &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13663359/fda-recalls-herbal-supplement-sold-amazon-life-threatening-risk.html"&gt;contaminated along&lt;/a&gt; the production line or come in dosages that are &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14470339/Doctor-reveals-popular-supplements-health-crises.html"&gt;far higher than recommended&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Ramirez of Fort Worth, Texas is experiencing liver failure, which her gastroenterologist attributed to a typically innocuous ingredient called methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) in her hair growth supplement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Ramirez warned her TikTok followers of the risk of taking the supplement, which was made and sold by a [popular drugstore, from her hospital bed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘They couldn’t figure out what was wrong with me, apart from needing my gallbladder removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They thought I had hepatitis, and [the tests] were all negative, negative, negative, negative. They’re like, have you started any new medicine, I’m like, no. [They asked] Have you started a new multivitamin or any vitamins?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained that as she has shed pounds, she has taken more supplements to stay strong and replenish any vitamin deficiencies from changing her diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among them was a supplement designed to strengthen the protein in hair and nails, boost collagen, and increase levels of minerals like zinc and vitamin E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘It didn’t click to me to be like, oh, I started a hair, nails [vitamin]. So today, my GI doctor came in. He’s like have you started a hair growth vitamin? And I’m like, yeah.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor told her that she ‘induced liver failure.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Be very careful doing these vitamins, these supplements,’ she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Ramirez had to have her gallbladder removed as a result of severe damage to her liver, which processes digestive fluids&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors first believed she may have hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver. Many diagnostic tests showed nothing abnormal. But her gastroenterologist floated the idea that MSM could be the culprit behind her jaundiced skin and eyes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her case is seemingly rare as there are no similar instances &lt;span&gt;recorded in humans or mice in the medical literature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She wrote on her &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-jenny-heal-and-care-for-her-family?attribution_id=sl:f0dbae17-7c9a-4b7b-9368-161a4428eee2&amp;amp;lang=en_US&amp;amp;utm_campaign=fp_sharesheet&amp;amp;utm_content=amp13_t1-amp14_t2&amp;amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;amp;utm_source=copy_link"&gt;GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt;: 'I would never think I would be in this spot in a million years.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Ramirez said she had taken the CVS brand supplement.

Among them was hair loss, which can occur as a result of nutrient or protein deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, Ms Ramirez of Fort Worth, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-a5d9ac40-13c0-11f0-93dc-d7dabae5537a" class=""&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, began taking a common over-the-counter vitamin that claimed to improve hair, skin and nail health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, soon after beginning the vitamins in late February, she began noticing yellowing of her eyes and skin.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her doctors discovered she was experiencing liver failure, which her gastroenterologist attributed to a typically innocuous ingredient called methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) in her vitamin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has found MSM to be generally benign and even protect against liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some scientists have said, however, that MSM could exacerbate liver damage in people with pre-existing liver disease, but no cases of this have been reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, Ms Ramirez has become jaundiced, with yellowing skin and eyes. She has also undergone surgery to remove her gallbladder because of hard deposits that had built up there, blocking the flow of bile through the liver and gallbladder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Ramirez of Fort Worth, Texas is experiencing liver failure, which her gastroenterologist attributed to a typically innocuous ingredient called methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) in her hair growth supplement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The gallbladder stores and releases the digestive fluid produced by the liver. But doctors may have to remove it if hard deposits form there, blocking the flow of bile from the liver and gallbladder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Ramirez did not say how her doctor concluded that MSM was the culprit, though supplements, which are &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-6269695/Hundreds-natural-supplements-contain-active-drugs-FDA-knows-doesnt-tell-public.html"&gt;not regulated by the FDA&lt;/a&gt;, can be &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13663359/fda-recalls-herbal-supplement-sold-amazon-life-threatening-risk.html"&gt;contaminated along&lt;/a&gt; the production line or come in dosages that are &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14470339/Doctor-reveals-popular-supplements-health-crises.html"&gt;far higher than recommended&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mom-of-four warned her TikTok followers of the risk of taking the supplement, which was made and sold by a [popular drugstore, from her hospital bed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘They couldn’t figure out what was wrong with me, apart from needing my gallbladder removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They thought I had hepatitis, and [the tests] were all negative, negative, negative, negative. They’re like, have you started any new medicine, I’m like, no.

So today, my GI doctor came in. He’s like have you started a hair growth vitamin? And I’m like, yeah.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor told her that she ‘induced liver failure.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Be very careful doing these vitamins, these supplements,’ she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Ramirez had to have her gallbladder removed as a result of severe damage to her liver, which processes digestive fluids&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors first believed she may have hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver.

                                        Estimated read time: 6-7
                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You're fat and tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not insulin's fault. Insulin is just the messenger. When sugar levels are high in the bloodstream, insulin instructs body cells to open their doors and allow sugar in. But under certain circumstances cells ignore insulin's message and the doors remain shut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the doors stay shut, you've got two problems. One, you don't get enough fuel (sugar) into the cells, so you're tired. Two, sugar stays in the bloodstream where it causes damage. In an effort to prevent this damage, the sugar is removed and stored as fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, you're fat and tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How likely is it that you have insulin resistance? "Pretty likely ,and getting more likely all the time," says Dr. Whit Roberts, D.C. of &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IR6" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The percentage of adults with insulin resistance has doubled in the last 20 years, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507839/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;according to research&lt;/a&gt; published in the National Library of Medicine. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22206-insulin-resistance" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Cleveland Clinic reports&lt;/a&gt; this is due to many factors including worsening diets, the exposure to more drugs and toxins, more stress and more fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Insulin resistance is perhaps the most serious epidemic in the world today, Roberts says. "It can lead to all the major killers including heart disease, obesity, strokes, diabetes and &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/sugar--insulin-resistance-and-cancer--what-is-the-link.h00-159461634.html" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;13 types of cancer&lt;/a&gt;. The good news is that we are learning all the time better ways to reverse it. Some are surprising."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Pixel-Shot - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One: Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9036496/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; published in the National Library of Medicine showed that people who get less than seven hours of sleep have higher levels of insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a problem since well over half my patients have some form of insomnia. They struggle falling asleep, staying asleep, or just getting sound sleep," Roberts says. "That's why at &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IR6" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;, improving our patients' quality and quantity of sleep is one of our highest priorities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting enough sleep, however, is easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fortunately, we have found that lowering total body inflammation through a proprietary combination of herbs, foods and therapies leads to improved sleep in almost all of our patients," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Nasnunt - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Two: Antioxidants&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second surprising way to reverse insulin resistance is to increase your consumption of antioxidants. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1865087/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;One study showed&lt;/a&gt; that taking 2 grams of vitamin C for two weeks resulted in a significant change in insulin resistance. Roberts explains this is why Health Utah's health and weight loss program relies heavily on eating foods rich in antioxidants. Additionally certain foods with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7602234/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;high polyphenol and phytonutrient content&lt;/a&gt; are recommended as they have also been found to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is the hard part. Everyone knows they should be eating better. It's just hard when low-quality foods are flavor-enhanced, sugar-laced, caffeine boosted and so convenient. That's why the health and weight loss program at Health Utah focuses heavily on making the transition to healing foods easier. They use a process called framework that engages the subconscious mind to reframe your relationship with food. Weekly classes and educational materials also provide skills, tools, and strategies necessary to achieve sustainable weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: hocine - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Three: Lemon juice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The craziest way science has found to help reverse insulin resistance is drinking lemon juice. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7468735/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Scientific research&lt;/a&gt; is now reflecting what holistic healers have suggested for years, that lemon juice has a powerful effect for good in the body, even improving sensitivity to insulin and lowering blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts and &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IR6" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; utilize this kind of knowledge in working with their patients. Lemon juice has been a consistent part of their health and weight loss program for over 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When our patients start their health and weight loss program, they begin by cleaning out the body. This requires improving liver function," Roberts says. "Lemons, herbs and in-office therapies facilitate this detoxification as well as the reversal of insulin resistance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health Utah specializes in sustainable weight loss. Everything they do is geared toward this goal. Their coaching, their classes, their work with the subconscious mind, the fact that they don't count calories or cut out carbs and their focus on reversing insulin resistance create a lasting solution to the health and weight issues of their patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IR6" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; invites KSL readers to take advantage of a $59 weight loss package. The package allows two people to get body scans. These scans identify potential underlying conditions that cause insulin resistance and stubborn weight. You will walk away with a 17-page report detailing the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts will review the results of the scan with you, correlate its findings with your health history. This provides a tremendous amount of information allowing him to make valuable recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will also be able to fill out a proprietary survey that will give you insight into health issues that likely compromise your weight loss efforts.

found 60 percent of people reported an improvement of their migraine attack after participating in some of form of sexual activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Having an orgasm may help you get rid of that days-long migraine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The neurologists sent a questionnaire to 306 migraine patients and 96 cluster headache patients who had been treated over a two-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants were asked to answer eight questions, including whether they had any experience with sexual activity during a headache attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A deep analysis into their answers showed out of the 34 percent of people who had experience with sexual activity during a migraine attack, 60 percent saw their attacks improve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Out of this, 43 percent of people with migraines found their headache changed shortly after orgasm or maximal excitement, about 18 percent reported the change with the time of orgasm, 20 percent found the change at the beginning of sexual activity while another 20 percent had the change within 30 minutes of orgasm or maximal excitement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the case of cluster headaches, out of the 31 percent of the patients that had experience with sexual activity during an attack, 37 percent reported an improvement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While researchers are yet to discover the exact cause of migraines, some believe that specific nerves in the blood vessels can send pain signals to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This releases inflammatory substances into the head's nerves and blood vessels - causing a strong throbbing or pulsing pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stress, anxiety and emotional triggers can also release chemicals in the brain that contribute to migraines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr Megan Donnelly, a neurologist and headache specialist with Novant Health in Charlotte, North Carolina who was not involved in the study, orgasms and pain affect the same areas of the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained that orgasms stimulate the production of endorphins, which are natural pain relievers in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The release of endorphins from sex can be a powerful distraction as well as give relief from the pain of a migraine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During a migraine attack, people may have lower levels of certain neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin. Both of these neurotransmitters are released during sexual activity and can improve the ache. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The release of endorphins from sex can be a powerful distraction as well as give relief from the pain of a migraine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the study also found 33 percent of people who suffered from migraines and 50 percent of people with cluster headaches saw their condition worsen after sexual activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Donnelly noted: 'Although 60 percent of migraine patients surveyed reported an improvement in their headaches with sexual activity, one-third of those with migraines found their headaches worsened with sex.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2019 study published in the Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology found 78 percent of people living with migraines - mostly women - also experienced sexual dysfunction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the longer the duration of migraines and the more frequent they were, the lower the sexual functioning among migraine sufferers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The neurologist told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdlinx.com/article/migraines-exploring-sex-as-a-cure-and-cause/7uCku8mRtkVKoyyxPs8hrV"&gt;MDLink&lt;/a&gt;: 'Treating migraines may positively impact sexual dysfunction, but individual responses can vary.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the expert, some migraine sufferers may also be experiencing a condition called sex headache. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Dr Megan Donnelly, a woman's neurologist and headache specialist with Novant Health in Charlotte, North Carolina &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Headaches associated with sexual activity, sometimes called 'orgasm headaches' or 'sex headaches,' can range from mild to severe and occur during or after sexual activity, often around the time of orgasm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324719#:~:text=When%20a%20person%20has%20an,intense%20headaches%20in%20some%20people."&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;, orgasms can rapidly increase blood pressure which can cause blood vessels in the head to dilate.  This can trigger sudden, intense headaches in some people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In most cases, they are considered benign and do not have an underlying cause, however, at times sex headaches can be a symptom of a more serious condition, such as problems with blood vessels in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These kind of headaches occurs four times more often in men and people are usually in their 40s when it first happens, according to a 2010 study published in The Journal of Headache and Pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 17:02:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOYkVTSC0xcllZX2lfUzVwcFJFRjBpb2NmV2twLWx3R3ZHaEJKYVNXYmxPbHdHX0YwUjYxOHJNMnFfR1NkQnY3OUx0cWx0OS1VWE9Wc242M0dvUVczdThqTHg1QUpZOExQSUJQRTBnZkVxNEpVd2NrZUQ1RzdvdnFEaGUtdFJVYmhpS2E4NzhmTzZwV2Q1WUx1STNuRFZIemo0SlFTWNIBqgFBVV95cUxOSG43S2ZGVTkyQzN5OFhWMml0OURDeFZETms5UWFORGt3RHpQOWx3RUhJaXFqNE5jVWMxbkxZeUtsQVcxZ0VqUlFzRl9JMi1HbDRrakpLdE8yX2prdWpWODRoaVVxdXdyX2tsWDNmVlZRcDZsXzBreGtUaGlfLXFLcC1JZENTcVRXelE5NUt1YXNrUkR6cUhDaFZYcWU3OG0wX1BXSEJRUUJJdw</guid></item><item><title>What exactly is brain fog?

Recently, however, scientists have made some breakthroughs in understanding what might provoke it in some conditions—particularly long COVID—and how to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;What brain fog is—and what it isn’t &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;While there is no universally agreed upon definition of brain fog—and many experts debate how useful the term is in a clinical setting—most scientists consider it to be a set of symptoms of an underlying condition rather than a diagnosis. “Brain fog has become a catch all for all of the broader neurological symptoms of certain conditions like long COVID,” Becker says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As to why so many different conditions cause similar symptoms, it might be because brain fog can point to deficits in many areas of cognition, including attention, concentration, or ability to execute tasks, says Avindra Nath, intramural clinical director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. “If the brain isn’t functioning properly, people call it brain fog.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Yet experts distinguish brain fog from cognitive impairment, the latter of which results in deficits in memory or attention that can be &lt;i class=" "&gt;measured&lt;/i&gt;. Patients with brain fog often report problems with attention and memory, but clinicians can’t always find measurable deficits in these areas. Sometimes, patients with brain fog undergo a battery of tests, only for everything to come back normal, she says. “That can be really frustrating for patients,” Becker says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Physicians sometimes dismiss the brain fog as purely psychological in nature. This is particularly true for people with chronic conditions or long COVID, who often feel like their providers aren’t taking them seriously, Becker says.“There is a prevailing perspective that long COVID,” has a purely psychiatric origin, she says. “And I think it's important to challenge that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>National Geographic</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 17:01:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE9UTlZtdS02aHoxa2tMR2ZJaExCWUtlcnNzQjZ5Uk13cEtqVVZRYTZVUUk4cU5TQlZUYVNYcEV4ZlB3VW55anZMQlhZaWRIZ1lQN3lua1RFdXNXZ3UyZzhxWmJRVWdxU0ZMaVFCWTdfOHg4bE9yQ0ZtUHc2VkJFR2c</guid></item><item><title>Man receives world's first sperm transplant in groundbreaking experiment to reverse infertility - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A man in his early 20s has received the world's first sperm-making stem cell transplant in a new procedure that could be groundbreaking for infertility treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Until now, the procedure had only been tested in animals. But it successfully allowed male mice and monkeys to father offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patient was diagnosed with azoospermia, a condition that causes no sperm to be present in his ejaculate and makes it impossible to naturally conceive a child, after receiving chemotherapy as a child to treat bone &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-da70d850-13cc-11f0-a4f1-4f5cc1f4a174" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But men can develop azoospermia for a number of reasons, including &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13988987/frightening-effect-consuming-soup-body.html"&gt;hormonal dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a blockage along the reproductive tract and certain genetic conditions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, azoospermia affects roughly 645,000 men between the ages of 20 to 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For this clinical trial, doctors implanted the man's own stem cells — which were harvested and frozen during his childhood before he underwent chemotherapy  — into his reproductive system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14531869/paralyzed-man-walks-stem-cell-injection-treatment.html"&gt;Stem cells are capable of developing into many different types of cells in the body&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In this case, the doctors used sperm-forming stem cells, which are present in the testicles at birth and later mature into sperm cells during puberty. If the transplant succeeds, the patient should begin producing sperm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A man in his early 20s has received the world's first sperm-making stem cell transplant, and this new procedure could be groundbreaking for infertility treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No sperm cells have been detected in his semen yet, but ultrasounds confirmed his hormone levels and the procedure did not damage the man's testicular tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Going forward, the doctors will analyze a sample of his semen twice a year to see if it contains sperm cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If refined and proven safe, spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) transplantation could be a revolutionary fertility-restoring technique for men who've lost the ability to produce sperm,' Dr Justin Houman, an assistant professor of urology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center who was not involved in the study, told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/fertility-pregnancy-birth/man-gets-sperm-making-stem-cell-transplant-in-first-of-its-kind-procedure"&gt;Live Science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This treatment may prove especially beneficial for other cancer patients who received chemotherapy before puberty, and thus developed azoospermia, or men with 'genetic or acquired testicular failure,' he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The historic procedure is detailed in a paper published on the preprint server &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.25.25324518v1"&gt;medRxiv&lt;/a&gt;, which features research that is still undergoing review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Young men at risk of developing azoospermia can choose to harvest and preserve their sperm-forming stem cells for future use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If they are diagnosed with the condition after reaching sexual maturity, doctors can then return these stem cells to where they came from: the rete testis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rete testis are small tubes helps move sperm cells from the testicles to the epididymis: a narrow, tightly-coiled tube that is attached to each of the testicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;This treatment may prove especially beneficial other cancer patients who received chemotherapy before therapy, and thus developed azoospermia, or men with genetic or acquired testicular failure (STOCK)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is done using an ultrasound-guided needle. In theory, once the stem cells are implanted, they can mature and begin producing sperm — essentially giving the patient a second chance at puberty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, researchers noted that there is a chance that the patient who participated in this clinical trial may never recover his fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They said one reason for this could be that only a small amount of stem cells were harvested from the patient during his childhood to avoid damaging his reproductive tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Therefore, it's possible that any sperm production resulting from the transplant may be limited, if it occurs at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the patient never begins producing a sufficient amount of sperm cells, he will still have other options for fathering a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Through surgery, doctors could try to recover any sperm cells he does produce and use them for in vitro fertilization (IVF), which involves growing an embryo in a lab with sperm and stem cells that have been harvested from each parent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But there are other risks too, especially for patients with azoospermia who have also been diagnosed with cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For these patients, some of the transplanted stem cells could have cancer-causing genetic mutations that could eventually develop into new tumors, Houman told LiveScience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What's more, there's also a 'theoretical risk' that the transplant could trigger a dangerous inflammatory response from the patient, even though it uses their own cells, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We need to proceed cautiously, and with rigorous oversight,' he said. 'This is promising science — but it's still early days.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Then there are seven supplements you need to add to your routine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health coach Cory Rodriguez has revealed how to improve all four of these areas of your life by taking a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14556439/bryan-johnson-pill-aging-longevity.html"&gt;cocktail of daily supplements containing magnesium. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Magnesium is an essential mineral that comes in many forms, each with their own benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first form of magnesium Mr Rodriguez recommends is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14555957/The-cheap-powder-gym-fanatics-love-ease-depression-tiredness-chronic-fatigue-long-Covid-Oxford-researchers-say-semi-essential.html"&gt;magnesium glycinate for  sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Sleep Foundation notes this&lt;span&gt; form of magnesium can be easily absorbed by the body and it is recommended by sleep experts to 'promote calm, relaxation, and improved sleep'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Naoki Umeda from the Cleveland Clinic recommends keeping your magnesium dosage for sleep at 200mg nightly and taking the supplement about 30 minutes before bedtime. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next up, Mr Rodriguez says magnesium chloride is the best version for digestion. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say this supplement can positively impact digestion by acting as a natural laxative, easing constipation, and potentially reducing bloating and cramping due to its muscle-relaxing properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Health coach Cory Rodriguez has revealed how to improve your sleep, digestion, memory and energy by taking a cocktail of daily supplements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Annie Price, who is a certified holistic health coach for health company DrAxe.com, explains that magnesium chloride aids digestion by offsetting a decline of gastric acid secretion in the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gastric acid is produced by the stomach, and she highlights that it's 'absolutely essential to proper digestion because it helps break down foods into smaller absorbable units. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Without enough gastric acid, we not only can have suboptimal digestion, but we can also experience a malabsorption of essential nutrients.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, an excessive intake of magnesium chloride can lead to digestive issues like diarrhea. The recommended dose is 500mg to 1,000mg per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For an extra boost of energy, Mr Rodriguez - who has close to 3million followers on Instagram - advises stocking up on magnesium malate. The dose ranges from 200mg to 400mg per day, depending on your gender, age and health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The nutritional compound, which is a blend of magnesium and malic acid, is touted for promoting energy production. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dietician Ozgenaz Kazan explains: 'Malic acid, a component of magnesium malate, is a key player in cellular energy production. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It takes center stage in the process known as the Krebs cycle, which is a central part of how our bodies generate energy from the foods we eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This energy production can lead to increased vitality and decreased feelings of fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So, if you've been looking for a natural way to boost your energy levels, magnesium malate might be worth considering.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you're looking to improve your focus and ability to concentrate, Mr Rodriguez recommends magnesium L-threonate as an option. The recommended dosage of this supplement is 2000mg per day, with four 500mg tablets &lt;span&gt;split between mornings and evenings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one human study, the supplement was shown to improve learning, recall, memory and cognitive abilities, with older people demonstrating the most improvement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moving to another area of the body, Mr Rodriguez says magnesium sulfate - commonly known as Epsom salts - can help ease sore muscles and aid relaxation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The salts are a popular addition to warm baths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Detailing the benefits, Dr Umeda explains: 'The idea is that when you pour Epsom salt into warm water, it dissolves the magnesium and sulfate and allows it to be absorbed into your body through your skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mr Rodriguez says that magnesium chloride is the best thing for digestion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Centuries of user testimonials claim wonderful benefits from using Epsom salt this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Scientific research, however, isn't quite as vocal in its support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There are no definitive studies showing that magnesium can be absorbed through your skin in sufficient amounts to address potential deficiencies of the mineral. And what research has been done offers skepticism.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says when purchasing Epsom salt, it is important to buy a product that's 100 percent magnesium sulfate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then he suggests pouring about 300g of Epsom salt into a tub as it fills with hot water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He adds: 'Once the bath is drawn, test the water for its heat level and adjust as needed. You don't want to scald yourself. Slowly ease yourself into the tub and relax. A 15-minute soak should be enough.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another muscle Mr Rodriguez says magnesium can benefit is the heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Magnesium taurate is a dietary supplement made up of magnesium and taurine, an amino acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many health brands recommend taking three 500mg capsules per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Explaining why these ingredients can benefit the heart, experts from Health.com note: 'In addition to reducing blood pressure, magnesium taurate may have an overall cardioprotective effect - meaning that it may protect heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This could be due to its antioxidant properties, or its ability to reduce cell damage caused by oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Magnesium supplements, including magnesium taurate, have been found to prevent and treat high cholesterol, cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), stroke, and heart disease. They may also help to reduce the overall damage after experiencing a myocardial infarction (heart attack).'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lastly, Mr Rodriguez says magnesium citrate is a great remedy for constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some studies have reported positive outcomes using doses ranging from 290mg to 2,000mg per day, depending on individual factors and the severity of constipation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, most experts recommend starting with a smaller dose, such as 200mg to 400mg per day, and then gradually upping the dosage as required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physicians from the Cleveland Clinic explain that it works by increasing the amount of water your intestine absorbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This softens the stool, making it easier to have a bowel movement, while at the same time, it increases pressure, which prompts the muscles in your intestines to move the stool. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Cleveland Clinic, the recommended maximum daily intake of magnesium supplements for adults is 350 mg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts note that excessive intake can potentially lead to side effects like diarrhea, nausea, and cramping. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Rodriguez says he generally sticks to magnesium glycinate as i&lt;span&gt;t's 'quite useful for better sleep and this type is also very absorbable by the body, so it does a good job of raising magnesium levels in the blood'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 16:29:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxObHNQT1EwRlRhZFpfS3JCLWFqb3hxczRZMGpwVlN0Qm4xOXJ2R2RYMUVRZm0xc3FEcjlwMDJveFNPZE1jYVZXa3doV2J3WVN2MnByblh0enYxNDlLR3QyMENNVFFnZUxCV1lQcnI2MXI5ZVB6RFpucjEwZ2lya21sSXBTWG9Da2FFTVVhRktidy0xV0tMbXMwUWlaeWJzemVZVDA1dlRQVFRwZ9IBrwFBVV95cUxPNlE5dGl4QVljUnRqZnFYVzdXakdnQndPZGVIc1JhWkpkSWU1dFR6b1FYQnFzS0hma25mYmxQQUUyWXRZekZ0NE85YWVPbEh4NUpOdmxSemt1OFVMOEZxUWdMdGd1czRvZGtnUFJ0Y3hUeFlDc2hMX3FwRDJ4a0xIaTY3eFVacUw0Yk9qa3hIU0tCQWRjQUxyY1ZUNXhEVV9YVGQ1Z3NKV0haZTl0MVRR</guid></item><item><title>Robert F Kennedy Jr claims anti-vax physicians healed ‘some 300 measles-stricken children’ - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxNc0RTOU5taHNzcTBCYmZGVDlReW9qa09fdWJuc2FqZ0xHTmFzd2hTcFJmTjUwOGM5S3E2aTY5Z1ljU3M0TGtkSnlLYjlXMnlSMjFoTWlVUy1lSW5oWlhoeDlxdnMyOUs3U2lzcGNzVDZkVHdYMUJfdWk1aHRqQjhkRA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;

At the time, he had stopped short of endorsing the MMR vaccine, which he minimized as merely a “personal choice” rather than a public health and safety measure that long ago was proven effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1909049021211263268" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday following his presence in Seminole at the funeral of Daisy Hildebrand, an unvaccinated eight-year-old who died on 3 April, Kennedy said he had visited with Richard Bartlett and Ben Edwards – and claimed without evidence the anti-vax physicians had treated and healed “some 300 measles-stricken Mennonite children”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The Texas Medical Board &lt;a href="https://www.tmb.state.tx.us/dl/FB642150-D8B3-A8F6-F5D3-E5832892E381" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;disciplined&lt;/a&gt; Bartlett in 2003 for his “inappropriate treatment of patients with intravenous antibiotics and other medications”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy’s tweet said Bartlett had used “aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin” to treat children with measles, two drugs Bartlett reportedly &lt;a href="https://science.feedback.org/review/no-evidence-budesonide-clarithromycin-aspirin-combination-silver-bullet-treatment-covid-contrary-texas-doctors-claim/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;previously claimed&lt;/a&gt; were also ingredients in his “magic bullet” treatment for Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Bartlett, who ran a short-lived congressional &lt;a href="https://www.gosanangelo.com/story/news/local/2019/09/27/richard-barlett-odessa-drops-out-congressional-race/3785795002/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, has something of a checkered past. During a lengthy medical career that he has said was “a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Journey-Medicine-Man-Confirmed-Miracles/dp/1943127824" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;calling from God&lt;/a&gt;”, patients &lt;a href="https://www.mrt.com/news/article/Congressional-candidate-faces-allegations-from-7821914.php" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;complained&lt;/a&gt; of receiving “unnecessary diagnostic tests, medications or treatments”. And in 2021, he received a criminal trespass &lt;a href="https://www.oaoa.com/local-news/bartlett-issued-trespass-warning-at-mch/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt; after being caught allegedly rifling through trash bags at an Ector county hospital where he did not work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Edwards, meanwhile, has a vaccine-free “wellness practice” at a converted barn building in Seminole where he promotes better nutrition and treats patients with cod liver oil and vitamins to control the measles outbreak, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/west-texas-measles-outbreak-families-forego-conventional-medicine-vacc-rcna194795" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Like Bartlett, Edwards is an advocate of budesonide, a corticosteroid more commonly used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease – and inhaled to open airways in asthma patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy has previously expressed admiration for the pair, telling&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369595673112" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; Fox News&lt;/a&gt; last month that budesonide has produced “very, very good results”, and that patients had experienced “almost miraculous and instantaneous” recoveries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Conversely, Kennedy talked up the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/mmr" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;MMR&lt;/a&gt; vaccine during his visit to Texas. He said the purpose of the trip was to comfort the families of Hildebrand and Kayley Fehr, a six-year-old whose death in February was the first from measles in the US in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“My intention was to come down here quietly to console the families and to be with the community in their moment of grief,” he said in an earlier&lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; post&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday to X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In early March, I deployed a CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] team to bolster local and state capacity for response across multiple Texas regions, supply pharmacies and Texas run clinics with needed MMR vaccines and other medicines and medical supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Since that time, the growth rates for new cases and hospitalizations have flattened.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Jaban Moore, who specializes in parasitic infections and chronic illnesses, recently shared the common symptoms that indicate your liver may not be functioning well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A zinc deficiency can lead to dermatitis, a skin condition that can cause inflammation, redness, and rashes, including around the mouth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Dermatitis and rashes around the mouth &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver toxicity can cause the body to not effectively absorb certain nutrients, such as vitamin B2 and zinc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to a 2022 review published in Nutrients Journal, a common complication of zinc deficiency is dermatitis, a skin condition that can cause inflammation, redness, and rashes, including around the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dermatitis often presents as skin irritation around your mouth and looks like a rash that has small fluid-filled or solid-appearing bumps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another possible cause of dermatitis around the face is vitamin B2 deficiency, which can indicate liver degeneration as it is one of the key organs that requires the particular nutrient to function, according to Dr Moore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Spider veins &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dilated blood vessels on the chest, abdomen, face or ribs are one of the first signs of liver dysfunction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since this organ is highly involved in regulating the chemistry of the blood through purification, problems in the liver can create dysfunctions in blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can affect the levels and processing of hormones throughout the body, which can manifest as spider veins, also known as telangiectasias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These are small dilated blood vessels that appear as red or blue lines on the skin, often resembling a spider web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Spider veins can also be an early sign of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), where there is a build up of fat molecules in the liver - which can potentially slow down blood flow and create clots in the veins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Itchy and darkened skin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A damaged liver can struggle to process and eliminate toxins and bile - leading to a buildup of bile salts in the bloodstream  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can cause irritation in the nerves and continuous itching across the body, including on your face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts recommend to avoid scratching the itches as it can worsen the irritation in the nerves and worsen the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While treatment options vary based on the severity of the itches, typical solutions include using mild soaps and taking prescription oral medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dilated blood vessels on the chest, abdomen, face or ribs may tend to be one of the first signs of liver dysfunction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Extensive buildup of fat molecules in the liver can also pave the way for acanthosis nigricans, a condition that creates darkened, velvety patches of skin in folds around the neck and armpits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Inflammation in the liver due to fat accumulation makes it less responsive to insulin released from the pancreas, which signals to create glucose - sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This disrupts its ability to process glucose and insulin - making the body resistant to the hormone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When cells become resistant to insulin, the body produces more insulin to compensate, leading to hyperinsulinemia (high levels of insulin in the blood). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Excessive insulin can accelerate the growth of skin cells in the body and in turn lead to a thickening of the outermost layer of the skin - causing it to darken. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver damage can also lead to hormonal imbalances and changes in the liver's ability to metabolize hormones - resulting in skin pigmentation changes that can create a grayish complexion on the face and darker skin in the folds of the neck.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Rosacea&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rosacea is a condition that can cause your skin to appear very red with tiny bumps and rashes. It is most commonly visible on the face.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While this facial redness, often affecting the cheeks and nose, itself is not a direct indicator of liver toxicity, it has been linked to fatty liver diseases like NAFLD and NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fatty liver disease occurs where there is a buildup of fat molecules which can cause liver damage and at times, inflammation - potentially creating a toxic environment in the organ.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some studies suggest that NAFLD and NASH can affect genes that control hair follicles and sebum producing cells - potentially leading to the development of rosacea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According Dr Moore, while a 2017 article from the American Academy of Dermatology suggests rosacea can be a visible sign of liver dysfunction, not everyone with rosacea has liver issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 16:06:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxOZWtnTDN2YW0xN2dTYmxiTWdVRlhHR0d3Nlc1V3Q4dXNCRFZGTS1BZFVmV2YtV25JTkZKVUgwRU44elFLRlN3MkxPSUhYV0ZYLUFVZmNKZFJOUFppRUNVNGNtOWZwN3BQbFdxYVpfNG0yTHJVSjNTTkxsQnNVb3NDRUdZWkVkcXJJWXpGeEk2QUpobks4MWNaeDBIUGxVX0JtdkHSAacBQVVfeXFMTTdrcktOdTVqTnVibEJTd2MtY0wtVzBra2VXTVZtUDVOeFVVRF9vcW9GSWJ5NmttbmpaVFVuaVdHUjBLaUNpMGkyX1J6cUJJcGtoZXBCNTdPMlkzUC1VSDYzSkVlUDVsMWVCTXZEWGxVSVo3V0E2MVA1VzEtWGZGLUl5SUhnY1FoSGEyWkNTV1B5NHRYVVlOR3hyLVhPMjV2VGk3S0Y2VmM</guid></item><item><title>Wonder drug or waste of money?

As a result, fish oil supplements have been &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/benefits-of-fish-oil#11-benefits" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;touted&lt;/a&gt; as a way of reducing the risk of heart attacks and inflammation, and improving cognitive function and skin health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This has made fish oil supplements a booming business. Omega-3 supplements are some of the most popular nutritional supplements in the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db399.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bda.uk.com/resource/supplements.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/fish-oil-market" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; put the value of the global fish oil market around $3.1bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2fa2e4b8-11c0-413b-8496-22e3f1015945" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Are whole-grain foods really healthier?","elementId":"2fa2e4b8-11c0-413b-8496-22e3f1015945","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/mar/24/are-whole-grains-healthy"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But the scientific data isn’t as emphatic.

However, what each supplement contains – say, how much EPA and DHA are in each pill – is not consistent. In the US, dietary supplements are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, explains Dr Stephen Kopecky, a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic. (Supplements &lt;a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/business-guidance/food-supplements#legal-requirements" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;are regulated&lt;/a&gt; in the UK.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“You’ve got to turn the bottle around to look at the ingredient label,” Kopecky says. Companies, he warns, “can change their labels week to week”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ ","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4},"elementId":"da47962f-944b-42fb-bdf5-b6410843d748","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="da47962f-944b-42fb-bdf5-b6410843d748" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ " data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99%C2%A0" data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-fish-oil-supplements" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the benefits of fish oil supplements?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Experts say it is important to differentiate between the benefits of eating fish and the benefits of consuming fish oil supplements. Omega-3s in fish have been shown to help reduce inflammation and plaque formation, lower blood pressure and triglycerides – a type of fat in the blood – and stabilize and protect cell members in the heart and brain, says Sherry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But nutrition is complicated. Kopecky says it is unclear whether these benefits come from the omega-3s alone, or a combination of the fatty acids and the way the fish was caught, prepared and served. “There’s all these other factors,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The current fish oil boom is partly attributable to a 1985 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3990713/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in the New England Journal of Medicine, says Dr Steven Nissen, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The paper found that “mortality from coronary heart disease was more than 50 percent lower among those who consumed at least 30g of fish per day than among those who do not eat fish”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Indeed, says Nissen, people who eat more fish tend to have better health outcomes. But it’s probably not just because they consume more omega-3s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-20" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the same time, she adds, “there has also been some research that shows no benefits and even some harm”. More study is needed on specific dosages and formulations, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If you do have high triglycerides or cardiovascular concerns, experts suggest you talk to a doctor before taking fish oil supplements. Prescription fish oil is available, says Sherry, and tends to be more regulated than over-the-counter supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-risks-of-fish-oil-supplements" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the risks of fish oil supplements?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some studies have found that potent fish oil supplements can put people at higher risk of atrial fibrillation – an irregular heartbeat that &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/atrial-fibrillation/what-is-atrial-fibrillation-afib-or-af" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;can lead to&lt;/a&gt; blood clots, stroke and heart complications.

class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“Sometimes you’ll see it in the context of weight management products or supplements for weight loss because the fiber helps you to stay full,” Cording says.

as part of that, it can be &lt;em data-node-id="19.1"&gt;supportive&lt;/em&gt; of weight management because of the impacts on fullness and blood sugar regulation,” Cording says. “But just introducing psyllium husk is not enough to cause weight loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Gans says you might lose a little weight while taking psyllium husk, simply because you’ll be more satisfied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“Fiber, overall, may help with satiety,” she says.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“For most individuals, psyllium husk is completely safe,” Gans says. “However, if on any medications or

Ozempic mimics a protein present in your own body called glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and activates GLP-1 receptors in your body, Cording explains. The activation of these receptors causes an increase in insulin, which helps escort glucose to your cells, where it’s converted to energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="34" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Ozempic also slows your digestion, making you feel fuller, longer, and therefore less likely to overeat. Psyllium husk works differently in your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="35" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“Everything is being called the ‘new Ozempic,’” Cording says. “Psyllium husk can help with reducing blood sugar and it can help you to feel more full so you may not be as prone to snacking or eating quite as much. But it’s not the same as Ozempic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-kind-of-side-effects-might-you-have-when-consuming-psyllium-husks" data-node-id="36" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="36.0"&gt;What kind of side effects might you have when consuming psyllium husks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="37" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The biggest risk is the risk of developing gas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“If a person is not used to consuming fiber in their diet, it may cause gas and bloating at the start,” Gans says. “Therefore, I would recommend starting slowly, less than the recommended dose, and also drinking plenty of water to help acclimate one’s body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="39" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;You can even end up constipated if you take too much psyllium husk and not enough water, Cording says—so make sure you're having plenty of H2O if you use the supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="40" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Overall, experts say psyllium husk can be a supplement worth your time—just check in with your doctor first.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Future work will be important to understand how risk factors like diabetes and obesity increase risk of dementia to develop effective treatments and prevention strategies.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the study, scientists at the University of Florida analysed the health records 396,963 people over the age of 50 with type 2 diabetes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;None had a diagnosis of dementia and were either taking GLP-1 medication or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) which work by reducing the amount of glucose the kidneys re-absorb allowing it to pass out of the body in urine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over a follow-up of a 10 years they found &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;'both GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is were statistically significantly associated with decreased risk' of dementia compared to other medication.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2831976?guestAccessKey=903463ed-188b-43f3-a655-a69f968d4580&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=040725"&gt;Jama Neurology&lt;/a&gt;, they added that among&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; GLP-1RAs specifically, 'semaglutide seems to be promising in reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD)'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They said: 'This finding is particularly intriguing given the existing research on semaglutide's neuroprotective properties.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Responding to the study, Dr Leah Mursaleen, head of clinical research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: 'The results from this study support the growing evidence that GLP-1RA and SGLT-2 inhibitors medicines may reduce dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We don't know yet why these medicines may be offering a protective effect, and will need more research to understand how they are affecting the brain.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Around 900,000 Britons are currently thought to have the memory-robbing disorder.

It’s so embarrassing - I’m always wearing elastic pants when I go out to eat. Why does this happen to some people?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/#/bundle/postmost?method=SURL&amp;amp;location=YAHOO&amp;amp;initiative=feed" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post.;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most patients with bloating who come to see me in my gastroenterology clinic think it is because something from inside - such as increased gas - is pushing their bellies outward. This drives them to try changing their diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sometimes that helps. Often it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For many people, frequent bloating has little to do with gas or stool; it could be an abnormal muscle response, researchers in my field have come to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If we think of the abdominal cavity - or the hollow part of the belly containing internal organs such as the liver and stomach - as a cardboard box, the issue may not be what’s inside the box, but rather the box itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And if we started pushing the lid of the box downward, something would have to give.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For many people, during bloating episodes, the diaphragm - or the muscle supporting the lungs between the abdominal and thoracic cavities - descends, and the abdominal wall muscles relax, pushing everything within the abdominal cavity, such as the bowels, forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This response - called abdomino-phrenic dyssynergia - may seem counterintuitive; after all, bloating often occurs with meals. So people try changing their diets. And for some, eliminating certain classic triggers such as onions or garlic can improve symptoms, but many are left wondering why that didn’t fix anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The good news? There are other ways to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Abdomino-phrenic dyssynergia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some amount of bloating is normal and universal. Usually, it is infrequent and transient - but if it happens often and affects your quality of life, talk to your physician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sometimes I find a quick and easy solution, such as stopping artificial sweeteners and chewing gum, or changing my patients’ continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, masks. But there are many other causes of bloating, including foods. Medical conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome may also play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Abdomino-phrenic dyssynergia can happen after eating, which is why food tends to be the first thing blamed. For instance, many people complain that lettuce gives them uncomfortable gas and bloating. But a 2019 study found that the gas produced by fermentation of lettuce via our gut microbiomes is minimal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;CT scans of the abdomen revealed that people who complained of bloating after eating lettuce had no significant changes in their intestinal gas compared to before eating lettuce. Instead, their scans showed the hallmarks of abdomino-phrenic dyssynergia: a descending diaphragm and the protruding abdominal wall muscles that forced their bowels from resting comfortably under the rib cage to move closer to the belly button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What to try for bloating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Consult your doctor: People are sometimes embarrassed by their bloating or brush it off as no big deal. It’s important to talk openly with your doctor about what’s concerning you and not delay. The first step is to ensure we are not missing anything serious, including celiac disease or ovarian cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Assess dietary triggers in a systematic fashion: Lactose intolerance or other classic food offenders such as cruciferous vegetables, lentils and beans account for bloating in as many as a third of patients. I tend not to recommend restricting too many foods - such as with a trial of a low-FODMAP diet - without the guidance of a registered dietitian. Make sure you have the right team with you and are assessing possible triggers in a systematic, trackable fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Be open about your bowel habits with your doctor: Sluggish bowels are an important source of bloating and may be easily treated with medicine. Your physician can also help evaluate if your pelvic floor may be aggravating your symptoms. Remember the cardboard box? The pelvic floor is the bottom of that box, and it, too, can contribute to bloating when those muscles don’t coordinate appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Discuss biofeedback training: If simple dietary changes don’t help and constipation is not an issue, you may need to think about abdomino-phrenic dyssynergia. A gastroenterologist can best evaluate. Two randomized placebo-controlled trials showed that special kinds of physical therapy exercises, called biofeedback, can train patients to mobilize their diaphragm and reduce bloating. This involved maneuvers to elevate the chest and contract the abdominal wall. After four weeks, participants who did these exercises before and after eating experienced 66 percent symptom improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This kind of biofeedback may not be available at every medical center. Some scientists have suggested that diaphragmatic breathing exercises, which involve related maneuvers and can be practiced at home independently, may also be of use to patients with bloating, but more research is needed to confirm the benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What I want my patients to know&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When a woman who has undergone menopause comes to my clinic complaining of new bloating, a little alarm goes off in my mind. That alarm gets louder if she tells me that the bloating is there all the time - even first thing in the morning. Bloating and distension can be one of the earliest signs of ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer is relatively rare, at least when compared with other cancers in the United States, but I take new bloating symptoms like this one very seriously because ovarian cancer is also one of the easiest cancers to miss at an early stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related Content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/04/04/sportsbooks-vip-programs-loyalty-hosts/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:‘VIP’ bettors say sportsbooks keep them playing, no matter the cost;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;‘VIP’ bettors say sportsbooks keep them playing, no matter the cost&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/04/03/cherry-blossom-dc-couple-picnic-annual-tradition/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Every year, they picnic under the cherry blossoms.

Prior to that, rates of invasive strep had been stable for 17 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Invasive group A strep occurs when bacteria spread to areas of the body that are normally germ-free, such as the lungs or bloodstream. The same type of bacteria, group A streptococcus, is responsible for &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/strep-throat-covid-fall-illness-what-know-rcna122152" target="_blank"&gt;strep throat&lt;/a&gt; — a far milder infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Invasive strep can trigger necrotizing fasciitis, a soft tissue infection also known as &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/fear-warming-oceans-flesh-eating-bacteria-rcna75935" target="_blank"&gt;flesh-eating disease&lt;/a&gt;, or streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, an immune reaction akin to sepsis that can lead to organ failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Within 24 to 48 hours, you could have very, very rapid deterioration,” said Dr. Victor Nizet, a professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Diego. Cases can transition from “seeming like a routine flu-like illness to rushing the patient to the ICU, fearing for their recovery,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The data came from 10 states, with roughly 35 million people total, that track the infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In 2013, around 4 out of 100,000 people were diagnosed with invasive strep. By 2022, that rate had risen to around 8 out of 100,000. The number of cases rose from 1,082 in 2013 to 2,759 in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The study identified more than 21,000 total cases of the infection over the nine-year period, including almost 2,000 deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“When you see this high number of deaths, extrapolate that across the country — we’re probably well into more than 10,000 deaths,” Nizet said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Christopher Gregory, a CDC researcher and an author of the study, said the threat of invasive strep to both the general population and high-risk groups has “substantially increased.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The study calls for “accelerated efforts” to prevent and control infections. It also offered a few possible explanations for the rise in cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;First, rising rates of diabetes and obesity, among other underlying health conditions, over the study period made some people more vulnerable to invasive strep. Both diabetes and obesity can lead to skin infections or compromise the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Second, invasive strep is increasing among people who inject drugs, which can allow the bacteria to enter the bloodstream. Infections have also increased in people experiencing homelessness — in 2022, the rate of infections among this population was 807 out of 100,000. Gregory said the rate was “among the highest ever documented worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/strep-throat-rates-remain-high-rcna80424" target="_blank"&gt;strains of group A strep &lt;/a&gt;appear to be expanding and becoming more diverse, which could create new opportunities for infection. Strains that have expanded in recent years seem more likely to cause skin infections than throat infections, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Those strains may also be &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/-arrived-post-antibiotic-era-warns-new-drugs-deadly-superbugs-rcna76601" target="_blank"&gt;driving resistance to antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; used to treat certain cases of invasive group A strep, macrolides and clindamycin. While penicillin is the go-to antibiotic to treat strep infections, it can be used in combination with clindamycin to treat toxic shock syndrome, and doctors sometimes prescribe a macrolide if a patient has a penicillin allergy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Overall, the study found that the rate of infections was highest in adults ages 65 and older, and rose in all adults from 2013 to 2022. But it did not detect an increased rate in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“That was, to me, the most shocking part of the study,” said Dr. Allison Eckard, division chief for pediatric infectious diseases at the Medical University of South Carolina. “Because clinically, we really are seeing what feels like an increase.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In late 2022, there were widespread reports from children’s hospitals of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/rise-invasive-strep-a-infections-us-kids-rcna61507" target="_blank"&gt;a spike in pediatric cases of invasive strep&lt;/a&gt;. The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/cdc-warns-rise-severe-strep-a-infections-children-rcna63034" target="_blank"&gt;issued an alert&lt;/a&gt; at the time, noting a possible link to respiratory viruses such as flu, Covid and RSV, which can make people susceptible to strep infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Eckard said pediatric cases have also started to look different in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We are just seeing more severe cases, more unusual cases, more necrotizing fasciitis, and cases that do raise concern that there is something going on more nationally,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Eckard added that more research should explore whether certain strep strains are becoming more virulent, or if severe strains are becoming more prevalent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors said the rise in group A strep infections also points to the need for a vaccine, especially given the rise in antibiotic resistance.

The same type of bacteria, group A streptococcus, is responsible for &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/strep-throat-covid-fall-illness-what-know-rcna122152" target="_blank"&gt;strep throat&lt;/a&gt; — a far milder infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Invasive strep can trigger necrotizing fasciitis, a soft tissue infection also known as &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/fear-warming-oceans-flesh-eating-bacteria-rcna75935" target="_blank"&gt;flesh-eating disease&lt;/a&gt;, or streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, an immune reaction akin to sepsis that can lead to organ failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Within 24 to 48 hours, you could have very, very rapid deterioration,” said Dr. Victor Nizet, a professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Diego. Cases can transition from “seeming like a routine flu-like illness to rushing the patient to the ICU, fearing for their recovery,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The data came from 10 states, with roughly 35 million people total, that track the infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In 2013, around 4 out of 100,000 people were diagnosed with invasive strep. By 2022, that rate had risen to around 8 out of 100,000. The number of cases rose from 1,082 in 2013 to 2,759 in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The study identified more than 21,000 total cases of the infection over the nine-year period, including almost 2,000 deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“When you see this high number of deaths, extrapolate that across the country — we’re probably well into more than 10,000 deaths,” Nizet said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Christopher Gregory, a CDC researcher and an author of the study, said the threat of invasive strep to both the general population and high-risk groups has “substantially increased.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The study calls for “accelerated efforts” to prevent and control infections. It also offered a few possible explanations for the rise in cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;First, rising rates of diabetes and obesity, among other underlying health conditions, over the study period made some people more vulnerable to invasive strep. Both diabetes and obesity can lead to skin infections or compromise the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Second, invasive strep is increasing among people who inject drugs, which can allow the bacteria to enter the bloodstream. Infections have also increased in people experiencing homelessness — in 2022, the rate of infections among this population was 807 out of 100,000. Gregory said the rate was “among the highest ever documented worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/strep-throat-rates-remain-high-rcna80424" target="_blank"&gt;strains of group A strep &lt;/a&gt;appear to be expanding and becoming more diverse, which could create new opportunities for infection. Strains that have expanded in recent years seem more likely to cause skin infections than throat infections, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Those strains may also be &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/-arrived-post-antibiotic-era-warns-new-drugs-deadly-superbugs-rcna76601" target="_blank"&gt;driving resistance to antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; used to treat certain cases of invasive group A strep, macrolides and clindamycin. While penicillin is the go-to antibiotic to treat strep infections, it can be used in combination with clindamycin to treat toxic shock syndrome, and doctors sometimes prescribe a macrolide if a patient has a penicillin allergy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Overall, the study found that the rate of infections was highest in adults ages 65 and older, and rose in all adults from 2013 to 2022. But it did not detect an increased rate in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“That was, to me, the most shocking part of the study,” said Dr. Allison Eckard, division chief for pediatric infectious diseases at the Medical University of South Carolina. “Because clinically, we really are seeing what feels like an increase.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In late 2022, there were widespread reports from children’s hospitals of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/rise-invasive-strep-a-infections-us-kids-rcna61507" target="_blank"&gt;a spike in pediatric cases of invasive strep&lt;/a&gt;. The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/cdc-warns-rise-severe-strep-a-infections-children-rcna63034" target="_blank"&gt;issued an alert&lt;/a&gt; at the time, noting a possible link to respiratory viruses such as flu, Covid and RSV, which can make people susceptible to strep infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Eckard said pediatric cases have also started to look different in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We are just seeing more severe cases, more unusual cases, more necrotizing fasciitis, and cases that do raise concern that there is something going on more nationally,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Eckard added that more research should explore whether certain strep strains are becoming more virulent, or if severe strains are becoming more prevalent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors said the rise in group A strep infections also points to the need for a vaccine, especially given the rise in antibiotic resistance. However, Nizet questioned whether that would be feasible now, with &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/top-vaccine-regulators-fda-threatening-new-approvals-rcna198898" target="_blank"&gt;top vaccine scientists leaving the Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“The lack of vaccine is devastating,” Nizet said. “Of course, we’re concerned about the turn of attitudes at the FDA and the CDC that seem to be putting some sticks in the spokes of the wheel of vaccine development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 15:02:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQQkNWaDFMcWNYc1l4RzJkQzZjdUpzSUlLYTRUVFFneWFBWWNZWC1iVFlVTEJqUDNZejRabU0tUzlwU1VfZ3J2dWoyM3YyemkwWGIzNlVRcV92am9jVG5NbnBBVUd5VFZ4bUFGekQxUUhVYk9BRmJjSjBLQ1piWjFpOXpQRE9vLThDVTZvVFNxWGZDTXlfLVVnSDNST1ZFbUdqSW9ORjJBOVgwZw</guid></item><item><title>Your Body Fat May Be Shaped by The Month You Were Conceived - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxQLURQN3NsWk4xZ3JWbTViTThNdzRUTDhRN1BvZ3hQZ0J4a3kwV1RBMTM3Q0pYNXdhdmthSVJyS3dmMVhSWXFXN3RSR0ZBUDZGYmJpcGtBcThFLXJESzZWZXlFUnpnMExJNlE1S2xYTkEyOTNFVEd4TjhLUkM2SGNLWDZTVGRxQmxJbktqbkxNV0dWdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The season in which you were conceived could have a surprising impact on how your metabolism works today. The largest study of its kind has found that individuals conceived in colder months store fat differently from those conceived in warmer months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among 356 healthy young male volunteers, researchers in Japan found that those who were conceived in a cold season showed relatively higher &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_adipose_tissue"&gt;brown adipose tissue&lt;/a&gt; activity. Brown adipose tissue is a type of fat that burns energy, keeps us warm, and helps regulate blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with increased brown fat activity, participants also showed increased energy expenditure, a lower body mass index (BMI), and less fat accumulation around their organs, which indicates better metabolic health overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those who are deemed overweight or obese, brown fat activity is &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-weight/measuring-fat/"&gt;often lacking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_157513" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-157513" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/Figure6httpsdoi.org10.1038s42255-025-01249-2.jpg" alt="Your Season of Conception Could Change How Your Body Stores Fat" class="size-full wp-image-157513" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/Figure6httpsdoi.org10.1038s42255-025-01249-2.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/Figure6httpsdoi.org10.1038s42255-025-01249-2-600x351.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-157513" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Summary of the intergenerational effects of preconception cold exposure. (Yoneshiro et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To extend the results to a wider population, the team of researchers considered a second cohort of 286 male and female adults of various ages. Ultimately, they &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01249-2"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; "modest yet significant associations" between conception during cold seasons and brown fat activity, along with decreased BMI, visceral fat area, and waist circumference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on their models, the team suspects that the increase in brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity is what is driving the other metabolic outcomes. BMI on its own, for instance, was not directly associated with the season of conception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings are only correlational, but they support and extend other observational studies, which have found that the &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-developmental-origins-of-health-and-disease/article/abs/seasonofbirth-phenomenon-in-health-and-longevity-epidemiologic-evidence-and-mechanistic-considerations/E1B3C2F487BE31E3554C462D34A2C204"&gt;season in which someone is born&lt;/a&gt; may &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/baby-girls-born-during-summer-are-more-likely-to-be-healthy-adults-research-suggests"&gt;impact their health outcomes&lt;/a&gt; later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current study did not find a significant link between a person's birthday and their metabolic health, but it did find a link with their season of conception, 266 days before birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that cold weather may impact the genetic expression of male sperm or female eggs, and these changes may be passed along to offspring when the two germ cells meet and fertilize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be a "sophisticated predictive cold adaptation" passed through the generations, which better enables offspring to survive in cold climates, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01249-2"&gt;according to the authors&lt;/a&gt;, led by biomedical scientist Takeshi Yoneshiro from the University of Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to explore that concept, which the authors call "Pre-fertilization Origins of Health and Disease".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the findings are supported by &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0102-y"&gt;past research on mice&lt;/a&gt;, which found that being exposed to certain weather conditions during preconception can enhance the metabolism of offspring, possibly because of epigenetic switches in their father's sperm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the authors of that same study applied their findings to humans, they found that those conceived during cold months were 3.2 percent more likely to possess active brown fat tissue, whereas those conceived in warmer months were more likely to lack active brown fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Japan have now extended those results. In their study, they exposed male participants to a chilly 19 °C (66 °F) for 2 hours. Brown fat activity and metabolic activity were assessed after cold exposure and after sitting at room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown fat activity was notably higher in those who were conceived in the Northern Hemisphere between January 1 and April 15 and October 17 and December 31, as opposed to those conceived in a warm period between April 16 and October 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team also considered real-world weather before and after each birth, finding a similar association in the conception period with daytime temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A major strength of our study is the thorough assessment of BAT using the gold-standard method and a large sample size of healthy participants," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01249-2"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our well-designed approach and the largest sample size in this field allow us to certify the intergenerational influence of cold stress on BAT activity in humans."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yoneshiro and colleagues argue that we need a better understanding of how cellular memories are stored and inherited to truly understand how environmental factors, like cold weather, exercise, or nutrition, can impact sperm, eggs, and the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Indeed," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01222-z"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; Helmholtz Munich epigeneticist Raffaele Teperino in an independent review of the research, "parental health and exposure to environmental challenges at conception, and maternal health and exposures during gestation and breastfeeding, are emerging as key determinants of offspring health and prenatal risks of complex, noncommunicable diseases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-025-01249-2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It felt like I had lost the gear for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We talk a lot about strength and muscle gain here on AoM. If you’re looking to get bigger and stronger, you’ll find plenty of articles on those topics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But an area of fitness that we’ve overlooked, but I’m now starting to appreciate more and more as I move into middle age, is muscle &lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I was experiencing in my basketball match-ups against Gus was a diminishment in this capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have given the age-related loss of muscle power a name: &lt;em&gt;powerpenia&lt;/em&gt;. And growing research shows that it’s a key predictor of whether you’ll be able to pick up your grandkid, climb a flight of stairs, or hoist your keister off the toilet when you’re 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you need to know about powerpenia — and how to resist it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h.2ougy1iytcld"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Muscle Decline Trifecta: Sarcopenia, Dynapenia, and Powerpenia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve likely heard of &lt;strong&gt;sarcopenia &lt;/strong&gt;— the loss of muscle mass with age. It typically begins around age 40 and accelerates after age 60. Muscle mass typically declines by .5-1% per year after 40. Sarcopenia leads to frailty in old age, which makes it hard for old people to get out of chairs, &lt;a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/take-the-simple-test-that-can-predict-your-mortality/"&gt;let alone get up from the floor if they fall down.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there’s &lt;strong&gt;dynapenia &lt;/strong&gt;— the loss of muscle strength. Sarcopenia contributes to dynapenia, but there are also other things going on that lead to age-related declines in muscle strength. Mostly it comes down to our neuro-muscular system becoming less efficient at activating our muscles. Muscle strength declines along a similar trajectory as muscle mass, with a loss of 0.5–1% per year after age 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both sarcopenia and dynapenia can be mitigated and even reversed with regular strength training, which is why we’re big fans of weightlifting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10961295/"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; introduced a third area of concern: &lt;strong&gt;powerpenia&lt;/strong&gt; — the loss of muscle power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muscle power is the ability to display strength quickly; it’s explosiveness. Examples of muscle power in action include jumping for a rebound, sprinting, and punching. But muscle power doesn’t just come in handy in sports. Muscle power is also what lets you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sprint to catch your kid running into the street&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jump out of the way of an object about to hit you&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lift something quickly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bound up stairs two at a time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Catch yourself during a fall&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powerpenia may be the new age-related muscle concern on the block, but it seems to be the most influential factor in the maintenance of our physical vitality. In fact, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10961295/"&gt;a recent study&lt;/a&gt; found that power — not strength — is the best predictor of whether older people are able to successfully navigate the activities of daily living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="htlad-Mobile_Inline_MedRec"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about muscle power is that it actually drops faster than muscle size and strength — as much as 2–4% per year after 40. That means by your 60s or 70s, you might still look pretty solid and even test decently on a strength test, but you’ve lost the explosiveness needed to stay agile and independent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why the rapid decline? Three big reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, there’s the loss of fast-twitch muscle fibers. Fast-twitch fibers are responsible for generating quick bursts of strength and speed, and they naturally atrophy faster than slow-twitch fibers as we age and don’t call upon them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, there are the changes in our tendons due to inactivity. If you don’t regularly do activities that require you to display strength quickly, your tendons become stiff and less efficient at storing and releasing energy, making explosive movements harder to perform. The degradation of tendon health from disuse explains why a lot of middle-aged guys injure themselves when they decide to play pick-up basketball for the first time in a decade. It’s why I got a bad case of hamstring tendonitis a few years ago when I decided to do a sprint workout after years of not sprinting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, as we age and don’t call upon our fast-twitch muscles for explosive activity, our brain and nervous system become less efficient at telling our muscles to contract quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h.nb7xyes20zkg"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Fight Back Against Powerpenia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After my lackluster performance in basketball games against Gus and after reading the research on powerpenia, I decided I needed to do something to counteract the decline of muscle power that comes with middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, it’s not that hard to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some things I’ve started to incorporate into my physical training to fend off powerpenia:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h.3kvc6vtco0i7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plyometrics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plyometric exercises develop explosive power by training your muscles and nervous system to react quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to devote an entire workout to plyos. You can add one or two plyometric exercises to your regular strength-training routines. Here’s what I’m doing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before my first lower-body workout of the week, I do the following plyometric exercises:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power Skipping. &lt;/strong&gt;Perform a regular skip, but jump and lift your knee as high as you can. I do this for 15 yards, three times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Box Jumps&lt;/strong&gt;. Stand in front of a box or other suitable platform. Try to find a box that’s at least 18″ off the ground. Jump onto the box. To avoid injury, step rather than jump down from the box. Do three sets of five jumps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before my second lower-body workout of the week, I do the following plyos:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broad Jumps. &lt;/strong&gt;Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, swing your arms back, bend your knees, and then explosively jump forward as far as possible, using your arms to help propel you. Land softly with your knees slightly bent to absorb the impact and maintain balance. Do three sets of five jumps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pogo Hops&lt;/strong&gt;. Stand with your feet together and begin jumping straight up as high as you can. When you land, begin the next jump as quickly as possible. Do three sets of ten hops.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before my first upper-body workout of the week, I do the following plyometric exercise:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="htlad-Mobile_Inline_MedRec"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plyometric Push-up&lt;/strong&gt;. Assume a normal push-up position. Lower yourself to the floor. With explosive force, push off the floor with enough force that your hands leave the ground. Do three sets of five push-ups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before my second upper-body workout of the week, I do the following plyometric exercise:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overhead Medicine Ball Slam. &lt;/strong&gt;Raise the medicine ball overhead and slam it down as hard as you can. Do three sets of ten slams.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I continue with these plyos, I’ll probably rotate some of them out and substitute some of &lt;a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/beginners-guide-to-plyometrics/"&gt;the plyometric exercises we’ve written about here&lt;/a&gt; into my routine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h.gm5v3el61q5r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hill Sprints&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hill sprints are one of the most potent weapons against power loss. They engage fast-twitch fibers better than flat-surface sprints while also reducing impact on your muscles and tendons, thus reducing the likelihood of injuries. Besides training for power, hill sprints are a great &lt;a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/podcast-970-hiit-martin-gibala/"&gt;HIIT exercise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find a 20–30-yard hill. After a warm-up, do 4–6 sprints up the hill at 80–90% effort. Walk down slowly to recover. Rest 1–2 minutes between sprints. You just need to do this once a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more tips on doing safe and effective sprints in general, read our &lt;a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/the-grown-ups-guide-to-sprinting/"&gt;Grown-Up’s Guide to Sprinting.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for another powerpenia-fighting cardio/HIIT exercise, jump roping is a great one. &lt;a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/how-to-jump-rope-like-a-boxer/"&gt;We’ve got a whole guide to that, too.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it’s been a long time since you did the kind of explosive exercises outlined above, you may be concerned that trying them will get you injured. Start slowly and gently, to be sure. Doing things like stepping down from the box after your box jumps and sprinting uphill will help lessen the risk of injuries. And you can do things like broad jumps and hill sprints on softer surfaces like grass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you do need to steadily ease into these movements to avoid a kind of catch-22: avoid plyometric exercises out of fear of injury, and you actually increase the risk of injury when life suddenly demands an explosive movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only way to safely rebuild this capacity is to train it — gradually and consistently. And once you have it back, don’t stop. Keep training these movements into old age, until the day you’re truly no longer capable of doing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h.x8rprkw436kg"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s to Powerful Aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been doing these power exercises for about a month now, and I’m already noticing a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m still not as explosive as my teenage son, but I can better shift myself into that gear when we face off on the driveway court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And knowing that training for power will keep me strong and capable as I age — not just in the game, but in life — is the real win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="htlad-Desktop_Bottom_Flex"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="htlad-Mobile_Bottom_Flex"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="htlad-Mobile_Inline_MedRec"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="disco-widget" data-widget-id="WI_clin8nf4e002101ppb66qsrzn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Art of Manliness</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE1VZUhiNDJJbUoza2ktMk1RbzRoNXJZQ0pOR0tOR1MxU1ZuNVQ3cVBVUk9Wd3ltRG9CMDhibVNIUERXVmIyZFJtSXN6T1hocXlGV1lDY3laNk93NFZOOTZycHhJVVdNWnJYdmEzdHBqUUZtZlE</guid></item><item><title>ADHD and Music: Why Background Beats May Boost Study Focus - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYkFVX3lxTE9kaXh2eHZjaUdYRV9QcEI5T0pQV0lCSDVSaTE4UVphTHVaTV9NLUJkWVBrS1lUNFh4WUxIRzBXODNVX2JDYVVRTnVwaEZNOWwtOE9yVW1rMHNYcUtILVVmUVBB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study explored whether young adults with ADHD are more likely to listen to background music during daily tasks. The survey, involving over 400 participants, found that individuals with ADHD prefer listening to music—especially stimulating music—while studying or playing sports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This contrasts with neurotypical individuals, who tend to listen to music more passively, such as when relaxing. The findings suggest that music may help people with ADHD achieve optimal arousal levels for focus, opening new avenues for non-pharmacological support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Behavior:&lt;/strong&gt; Young adults with ADHD are more likely to listen to background music while studying and playing sports.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stimulating Sounds:&lt;/strong&gt; Individuals with ADHD prefer energizing music over relaxing tunes, possibly to boost cognitive performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Support Tool:&lt;/strong&gt; Musi&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Montreal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are people with attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity (ADHD) more likely to listen to background music while performing daily tasks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly-Ann Lachance, a doctoral student in clinical neuropsychology at Université de Montréal, decided to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and her supervisor, neuropsychologist and psychology professor Nathalie Gosselin, analyzed the responses of 434 young adults between the ages of 17 and 30 to an online survey about music listening habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108426"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a teen boy working on a laptop while listening to music." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Since music is ubiquitous and readily available, it could be valuable in helping people manage ADHD symptoms. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In lab studies, we rarely ask about listening habits, and yet it’s important because people differ in the amount of stimulation they need to perform a task optimally,” said Lachance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt; in January 2025. Lachance said she chose to publish in an open-access journal because she wanted to share her findings with a broader audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a future clinician, I want to use research to help the individuals I follow,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Detailed online questionnaire&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launched at the end of the pandemic, the study relied entirely on data collected through the survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some parts of it already existed, so we took the questions on music-listening habits and the subjective effects of background music and put them in an online questionnaire that could be completed in under 15 minutes,” explained Lachance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine whether respondents were ADHD or neurotypical, the survey included questions from the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale for DSM-5 (ASRS-5); 118 of the respondents screened as ADHD and 316 as neurotypical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ASRS-5 is a quick way to assess ADHD symptoms,” Lachance noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other questions in the survey assessed each respondent’s recent emotional state, level of anxiety and depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Music is used to modulate emotions, so we wanted to include emotional functioning in the study,” explained Gosselin, who is also director of UdeM’s Music, Emotions and Cognition Research Laboratory (MUSEC Laboratory) and a researcher at its parent organization, BRAMS (International Laboratory for Brain, Music and Sound Research).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Playing sports or studying&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study examined differences in background music listening during a host of daily tasks, including cognitive activities such as reading, writing and studying, and less cognitive activities such as cooking, taking public transport and playing sports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It found that people with ADHD reported listening to background music while playing sports and while studying significantly more than did neurotypicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, neurotypicals spent more hours per week listening to music while not doing anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the researchers weren’t completely surprised by the results, they didn’t see them as a foregone conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You could also imagine that music might interfere with performing a cognitively demanding task,” which could have made individuals with ADHD less inclined to listen to music at the same time, said Gosselin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, not only do young adults with ADHD like to have music in the background while studying, they prefer music that is stimulating rather than relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Why stimulating music? The literature shows that people with ADHD need more activation to perform at the same optimal level as neurotypicals. Music could help with this, regardless of the type of activity,” explained Lachance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, this is a hypothesis that requires future testing,” Gosselin pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A beneficial habit?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is music in fact beneficial for young adults with ADHD? How does it affect their concentration and motivation? Gosselin has been wondering about this for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My first neuropsychology internship was in child psychiatry,” she recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In one of my first cases, a father asked me if it was a good idea for his teen with attention difficulties to listen to music while studying. I didn’t know what to say because there were no conclusive data in the literature. But the question stayed with me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since music is ubiquitous and readily available, it could be valuable in helping people manage ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not suggesting it could replace medication, but it could complement it,” said Lachance. “The question is how we can use the full potential of music to promote optimal performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this music and ADHD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nouvelles.umontreal.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Catherine Couturier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nouvelles.umontreal.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Montreal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Catherine Couturier – University of Montreal&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1508181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Listening habits and subjective effects of background music in young adults with and without ADHD&lt;/a&gt;” by Nathalie Gosselin et al. &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listening habits and subjective effects of background music in young adults with and without ADHD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults listen to an average of 20.7 hours of music per week, according to a study conducted across 26 countries. Numerous studies indicate that listening to music can have beneficial effects on cognitive performance and emotional well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music listening habits may vary depending on individual needs and listening contexts. However, a limited number of studies have specifically examined the patterns of background music usage during various more or less cognitive activities, especially among individuals with attentional difficulties related to ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study primarily aimed to compare music listening habits during daily activities that are more and less cognitive (e.g., studying, problem-solving versus cleaning, engaging in sports) between neurotypical young adults and those screened for ADHD (respondents who were identified as likely having ADHD based on the number of self-reported symptoms). To achieve this, 434 young adults aged 17 to 30 responded to an online survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results indicate that certain listening habits differ significantly between the neurotypical and ADHD-screened groups. The ADHD-screened group reports significantly more background music listening during less cognitive activities and while studying, compared to the neurotypical group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also reveal a difference in the proportion of individuals preferring stimulating music between the groups: ADHD-screened individuals report significantly more frequent listening to stimulating music, regardless of the activity type (more or less cognitive). Other aspects of music listening are common to both groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the group, more respondents reported preferring to listen to relaxing, instrumental, familiar and self-chosen music during more cognitive activities, whereas for less cognitive activities, more individuals mentioned preferring to listen to music that is stimulating, with lyrics, familiar and self-chosen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results confirm that most young adults listen to music during their daily activities and perceive positive effects from this listening.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 14:40:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiYkFVX3lxTE9kaXh2eHZjaUdYRV9QcEI5T0pQV0lCSDVSaTE4UVphTHVaTV9NLUJkWVBrS1lUNFh4WUxIRzBXODNVX2JDYVVRTnVwaEZNOWwtOE9yVW1rMHNYcUtILVVmUVBB</guid></item><item><title>Long-Term Tirzepatide Demonstrates Benefits in Patients With CKD, Obesity, and HFpEF - Pharmacy Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxNcUdHZ2RVQ0UxVmZlVGtpcGpCQ1ItTzV2UXhFV0c3NlI1SXhjQW1uTzhHQlQ2Skh1bXdEU3VnUUsxamFwMndNZW9jYk9JdEdxcGJoUUNDTS1lQVdyTG0zdVlzSXdmSnBPMVFRbWtYSGpPNmdtdVN0WG1KTU0wWUZ0R1ZHM2l2MURJZHFyLVVYcTB5SEpveGxOSGNKMmRCekpfUFlCbjVCRFdEUXA2bWxMZ1VjWk93ejQ3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="blockText_blockContent__TbCXh"&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Long-term tirzepatide (Zepbound; Eli Lilly &amp;amp; Co.) improved renal function, determined by both cystatin C and creatinine, in patients with obesity, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), according to results presented at the 2025 American College of Cardiology (ACC) Scientific Sessions, which were held in Chicago, Illinois. Despite these positive findings, the investigators noted that the measurement of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients with obesity receiving incretin-based drugs may be skewed by the effects of fat and muscle mass on the synthesis of cystatin C and creatinine.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The results of this study were published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American College of Cardiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at the time of its presentation at the 2025 ACC Scientific Sessions, according to the investigators.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;div class=" figure"&gt;&lt;div id="image-caption" class="text-gray-500 italic"&gt;&lt;div class="blockText_blockContent__TbCXh"&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Image credit: Douglas | stock.adobe.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;The authors speculated that because obesity can lead to both CKD and HFpEF, CKD may influence the clinical course of obesity-related HFpEF, and incretin-based drugs may impact renal function. The SUMMIT trial, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 3 trial (NCT04847557),&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; was conducted to assess 2 outcomes: the influence of CKD on the clinical responses to tirzepatide—a glucagon-like peptide 1 agonist that targets 2 receptors to shrink fat cells and reduce the impacts that enlarged fat cells have on heart and kidney health—related to patients with obesity-related HFpEF; and the complexity of changes in renal function. For both of these outcomes, there was a focus on discrepancies between creatinine-based and cystatin C-based estimates of eGFR, according to the investigators.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;2,3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;The SUMMIT trial randomly assigned 731 patients with HFpEF and a body mass index of 30 kg/m&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or greater, of which about 60% also had CKD. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo or tirzepatide for a median of 104 weeks. They were followed for cardiovascular death or worsening heart failure events, as well as for changes in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score (KCCQ-CSS) after 52 weeks. The authors explained that because of the confounding due to obesity and changes in muscle mass, eGFR was assessed at randomization and after 12, 24, and 52 weeks by both creatinine-based and cystatin C-based formulas.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1-3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;The findings demonstrated that patients with CKD—based on creatinine or cystatin C—had greater severity of heart failure, as reflected by the following: worse functional class, KCCQ-CSS scores, and 6-minute walk distance; higher levels of N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide and cardiac troponin T; and a 2-fold increase in the risk of worsening heart failure events. Additionally, CKD was not observed to influence the effect of tirzepatide in the reduction of relative risk of major adverse heart failure events and to improve KCCQ-CSS, quality of life, and functional capacity; however, the absolute risk reduction in the primary events was numerically greater in patients with CKD.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Further, baseline eGFR-cystatin C was consistently approximately 9 mL/min/1.73 m&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; lower than that eGFR-creatinine in renal function assessments, with significant individual variance. Tirzepatide increased eGFR at the 52-week period, assessed by both creatinine-based and cystatin C-based formulas; however, this was with considerable discordance in individual patients. Tirzepatide also produced a decline in eGFR at the 12-week period with eGFR-creatinine but not eGFR-cystatin C. It led to an improvement in eGFR at the 52-week period in all patients when assessed by cystatin C; however, this was only in patients with CKD when assessed by eGFR-creatinine.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;“The interplay of these 3 conditions identifies a patient population as exceptionally high risk, which means it’s a patient population that is exceptionally in need of treatments that work,” first study author Milton Packer, MD, distinguished scholar in cardiovascular science at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, said in a news release. “This drug improves kidney function, obesity, and HFpEF outcomes, thus improving all 3 elements that interact to create this syndrome.”&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;article class="float-none w-auto my-4 p-4 bg-[#eee] md:clear-both md:float-right md:w-[40%] md:p-4 md:mt-0 md:mb-4 md:ml-4"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3 class="text-xl mb-3 font-medium"&gt;About the Trial&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="blockText_blockContent__TbCXh"&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trial Name:&lt;/strong&gt; A Study of Tirzepatide (LY3298176) in Participants With Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) and Obesity: The SUMMIT Trial&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov ID:&lt;/strong&gt; NCT04847557&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sponsor:&lt;/strong&gt; Eli Lilly and Company&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Completion Date:&lt;/strong&gt; July 2, 2024&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;The presence or absence of CKD did not impact the frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms in the 2 treatment groups, according to the investigators. In patients with CKD, gastrointestinal symptoms were reported in about 54.2% (n = 116) of patients treated with tirzepatide compared with 27.5% (n = 63) of placebo-treated patients (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001). In those who did not have CKD, about 58.8% (n = 78) of tirzepatide-treated patients and 24.8% (n = 33) of placebo-treated patients had these adverse events (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001), both defined by cystatin C. Similar results were also noted when CKD was defined by eGFR-creatinine.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1,2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;“Most patients with obesity who have HFpEF and CKD are not getting any effective treatment,” explained Packer. “We were very pleased to see the improvement in kidney function, which paralleled the favorable effects on the heart and on obesity.”&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h6 class="text-sm pb-4 pt-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REFERENCES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;h6 class="text-sm pb-4 pt-2"&gt;1.

More specifically, they exhibited heightened functional connectivity between the left superior occipital gyrus and the left superior parietal lobule. The research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci14121206"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brain Sciences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human brain has two distinct pathways for processing visual information: the dorsal and ventral streams. The dorsal stream, often referred to as the “where” pathway, originates in the primary visual cortex and extends toward the parietal lobe. It is primarily involved in processing the spatial location and movement of objects, helping to guide movements in relation to those objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the ventral stream—known as the “what” pathway—extends from the primary visual cortex to the temporal lobe. This pathway is essential for recognizing and identifying objects, including their details and colors. Together, the dorsal and ventral streams enable the brain to integrate visual information into coherent perceptions and facilitate effective interaction with the environment by combining recognition and spatial awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Kyle Cahill and his colleagues hypothesized that action video game players might exhibit enhanced functional and structural connectivity within these visual streams. They reasoned that action video games often involve intensive spatial exploration, navigation, and rapid timing coordination. As a result, prolonged gameplay might lead to brain adaptations in the form of increased connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 28 gamers and 19 non-gamers. Among them, 4 gamers and 12 non-gamers were female. Participants’ average age ranged from 20 to 21 years. On average, gamers played action video games for five or more hours per week. The researchers focused on four types of action video games: First-Person Shooter (FPS), Real-Time Strategy (RTS), Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA), and Battle Royale (BR). Non-gamers averaged less than 30 minutes of gameplay per week across any type of video game over the previous two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which focused on brain regions comprising the dorsal and ventral visual streams. The researchers used specialized software (DSI Studio 2022.08.0) to analyze structural connectivity between brain areas and to map components of both visual processing pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that action video gamers exhibited enhanced functional and structural connectivity in the regions under study, particularly within the dorsal visual stream. More specifically, functional connectivity was increased between the left superior occipital gyrus and the left superior parietal lobule during a moving-dot discrimination decision-making task—a test in which participants must determine the overall direction of motion in a field of moving dots. Gamers with heightened connectivity in this region tended to have faster response times. Structural connectivity in the dorsal stream was also greater in gamers compared to non-gamers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the brain, structural connectivity refers to the physical network of fibers—primarily axons—that link different regions, forming a stable anatomical framework. Functional connectivity, in contrast, reflects how different brain regions interact over time, even if they are not directly connected through physical structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These connectivity changes in the dorsal visual stream underpin the superior performance of action video gamers compared to nongamers in tasks requiring rapid and accurate vision-based decision-making,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These finding provide valuable insights into how action video gaming may induce improvements in structural and functional connectivity between brain regions in visual processing pathways. However, it should be noted that the design of the study does not allow any causal inferences to be derived from the results. While it is possible that gaming induces the observed improvements in connectivity, it is also possible that people with better connectivity in these areas are the ones who become action gamers as their brain anatomy allows them to perform better than other people in such games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci14121206"&gt;Connectivity in the Dorsal Visual Stream Is Enhanced in Action Video Game Players,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Kyle Cahill, Timothy Jordan, and Mukesh Dhamala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 14:17:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxOMVdwM0xwNlRxNWtHd0FiT1JJVHV2Z2dqRG55eG1JT1RBbUlzeF9NVFNUUDhvemIxenp3T1NkMXVaSVMzSl9PeUIxbml5bmpvT3piSnlhdXdyZW44SVlGSllKQ2EyTGl4Zk1sZW83Wk1ybXZBekpkVU83d0VMUWdpelRuNm02dldQYW1naTNJZTNvWWRnaWZZSV82cFlZVkFXcE9wT0FHLXAzOEpVaW9FVTRDSGJmdWhNSDd5Z09jTzBZQ2c</guid></item><item><title>Tuberculosis At Joliet West High School: What School Officials Know - Patch</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxOREMyQ19mU1QzY1RwVkJqeWlyV2dsUXhKT1dYUTZMYlRIY0hzeHBhaE5zNXZ2QmxrT1B4V2ozRmtoU1k1dWNwODhKYUh5eG5qcFFvWFpqTHp5Y2laZ1hFQUNhNDF3NEQtWm43THBzOFlwYjNWTXdYVE9Tel9QazR3VWFPdnBkeUxvVVlFRXEzMG9DWlRwLWZtdTNSVElBQdIBswFBVV95cUxOLWZ5TE0tcDdLMnZVY3BRWG1rT0IyOHlraWRiT3ZJZ1J5NW12eWNnclBHdzRJdWVFbC05LXhVTFNvdF9xRkFKc2NfX01FUEZHdWNXYWZXN1JMMXhMa2xjT3VrSWg1QnhwUkhZQkRUQTc1YkRrenlkVi02dXdFOWM4aTFIckNnUk9iZExCU1FMNDdVdDBSc3FCWXV3N1V4SXNrajdHendzbnVQYmYxMnZ6T2pQaw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;JOLIET — A recent &lt;a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/health/tuberculosis-case-confirmed-at-suburban-high-school-what-we-know-so-far/3711165/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Waukegan High School case involving a student testing positive for tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt; made the Chicago television stations, but last week's announcement involving a tuberculosis case at Joliet West High School was only shared in-house.

            &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania’s (UPenn) School of Dental Medicine and their collaborators in Finland report they have developed chewing gum made from lablab beans that was effective at neutralizing both &lt;a href="https://www.insideprecisionmedicine.com/?s=influenza" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.insideprecisionmedicine.com/?s=herpes+simplex+virus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;herpes simplex virus&lt;/a&gt; (HSV) transmission. The study, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/fulltext/S1525-0016(24)00808-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1525001624008086%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Molecular Therapy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, shows the promise of this method as a new tool to help mitigate the spread of infection through the oral cavity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These observations augur well for evaluating bean gum in human clinical studies to minimize virus infection/transmission,” said co-lead author Henry Daniell, PhD, a professor at UPenn’s School of Dental Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="mb-12"&gt;&lt;span id="malgam_render_2" data-render-ad="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was driven by the need for new tools to mitigate viral infections that spread through the oral cavity and focused on influenza A strains (H1N1 and H3N2) and two strains of herpes simplex virus (HSV-1 and HSV-2). According to the research, oral transmission of these viruses is several magnitudes higher than nasal transmission making the oral cavity an important target for antiviral treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this research, the investigators built upon previous work that demonstrated the efficacy of a similar antiviral approach for COVID-19. In this new work, the team tested a clinical-grade version of the chewing gum, which released the antiviral protein at the sites where viral transmission occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By targeting viruses where they spread most efficiently, in the oral cavity, this product could address a major gap in healthcare,” said Daniell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gum is made from lablab beans (&lt;em&gt;Lablab purpureus&lt;/em&gt;), which naturally contain a viral trap protein (FRIL) that binds to and neutralizes viral particles. The FRIL protein was released efficiently during chewing, with more than 50% of the protein being released within just 15 minutes of chewing. The researchers demonstrated that just 40 mg of the gum formulation was enough to reduce viral loads by over 95% in vitro, similar to what had been observed in their previous studies with SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="mb-12"&gt;&lt;span id="malgam_render_3" data-render-ad="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that the formulation of the gum used in their research adheres to clinical-grade drug standards, important to exhibiting its safety for a potential FDA submission. The researchers also performed stability testing, showing that the FRIL protein remains stable in both lablab bean powder and chewing gum for extended periods, providing early evidence of its suitability for commercial production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public health implications of this research are significant as influenza and HSV infections cause widespread illness. The development of an accessible and easy-to-use product that reduces viral transmission could help reduce the burden on healthcare systems, particularly during peak infection seasons. Further, since many antiviral treatments for these viruses are limited in some settings, the gum could provide an affordable, alternative means of preventing the spread of these viruses in community settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this positive preclinical data, the research team will now look to advance the gum into clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The observations from our study lay the foundation for evaluating this product in human trials to determine its real-world effectiveness,” the researchers wrote. They also plan to explore the use of lablab bean powder for tackling avian influenza, as recent outbreaks in North America have demonstrated the need for effective antiviral strategies against it in both humans and animals.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that mice developed strong aversions to a flavored drink after getting sick, even with a 30-minute delay between consumption and illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central amygdala, a brain region tied to fear and emotion, was active during tasting, illness, and memory recall—highlighting its role in “one-shot” learning. This discovery offers insight into how the brain links distant events, with potential relevance for understanding PTSD and other trauma-based memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Hub Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; The central amygdala encodes and retrieves aversive food memories.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gut-Brain Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Hindbrain cells with CGRP connect illness signals to memory centers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time-Delayed Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain tags novel flavors to form associations hours later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Princeton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve all been there: one bad oyster ruins seafood forever. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Princeton neuroscientists have pinpointed the exact “memory hub” in the brain responsible for these powerful food aversions in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new results reveal how “one-shot learning”, where a single experience creates lasting memories, unfolds in rodents, which might shed light on how similar memories form in people, such as when a single traumatic event leads to PTSD. As such, work on food poisoning in mice may help potentially inform future clinical treatments in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were published on April 2 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people can recall a vivid food poisoning experience that’s led them to avoid certain foods that made them ill. Christopher Zimmerman, Ph.D. has heard many such stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I haven’t had food poisoning in a while, but now whenever I talk to people at meetings, I hear all about their food poisoning experiences,” said Zimmerman, lead author of the new paper, and postdoctoral fellow at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute (PNI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the experience is common enough, the mystery that has long puzzled researchers was the time gap. Unlike touching a hot stove and feeling immediate pain, food poisoning involves a significant delay between eating contaminated food and getting sick – what Zimmerman calls the “meal-to-malaise” delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working in the lab of Ilana Witten, Ph.D., professor of neuroscience at PNI, Zimmerman first started to tease out the brain mechanisms behind learning to avoid sickening food by asking mice to try a new flavor they had never encountered before: grape Kool-Aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a better model for how we actually learn,” Zimmerman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Normally, scientists in the field will use sugar alone, but that’s not a normal flavor that you would encounter in a meal. Kool-Aid, while it’s still not typical, is a little bit closer since it has more dimensions to its flavor profile.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice learned that poking their nose in a special area of their cage would deliver a drop of Kool-Aid. Thirty minutes later after enjoying their first taste of the purple beverage, the mice received a one-time injection causing temporary food poisoning-like illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, when offered a choice two days later, the mice strongly avoided the once-appealing Kool-Aid and preferred to just drink water. What did stick out to Zimmerman and Witten, however, was where in the brain this juice/illness association was found: the central amygdala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you look across the entire brain, at where novel versus familiar flavors are represented, the amygdala turns out to be a really interesting place because it’s preferentially activated by novel flavors at every stage in learning,” Zimmerman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s active when the mouse is drinking, when the mouse is feeling sick later, and then when the mouse retrieves that negative memory days later.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central amygdala, a small group of cells towards the bottom of the brain involved in emotion and fear learning, also processes a lot of information from the environment, including smells and tastes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman’s results are the first to show how critical the central amygdala is at every step along the way of learning and were striking even with the very first experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I remember making the plot from the first animal and sharing it on Slack with Ilana,” Zimmerman said. “She was at my desk a minute later to talk about how exciting this is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that they knew where aversive flavor memories are formed, the team then traced how illness signals from the gut reach the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on hints from previous research, they identified specialized hindbrain cells containing a specific protein (CGRP) that directly connect to the central amygdala. Stimulating these cells 30 minutes after a mouse’s Kool-Aid experience created the same aversion as actual food poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also found that feeling sick caused the Kool-Aid-activated neurons to reactivate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was as if the mice were thinking back and remembering the prior experience that caused them to later feel sick,” Witten said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was very cool to see this unfolding at the level of individual neurons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team believes novel flavors may “tag” certain brain cells to remain sensitive to illness signals for hours after eating, allowing those cells to be specifically reactivated by sickness, and therefore connect cause and effect despite the time delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research opens new pathways for understanding how the brain forms connections between distant events – with implications beyond understanding how bad shellfish memories are cemented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Often when we learn in the real world, there’s a long delay between whatever choice we’ve made and the outcome. But that’s not typically studied in the lab, so we don’t really understand the neural mechanisms that support this kind of long delay learning,” Zimmerman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our hope is that these findings will provide a framework for thinking about how the brain might leverage memory recall to solve this learning problem in other situations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Funding for the study was provided by the National Institutes of Health (K99-DA059957, U19-NS104648, U19-NS123716, DP1-MH136573, RF1-MH128776, P50-MH136296), the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Simons Collaboration on the Global Brain, the Helen Hay Whitney Foundation, and the Brain Research Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this food aversion and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pni.princeton.edu/people/dan-vahaba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dan Vahaba&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pni.princeton.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Princeton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Dan Vahaba – Princeton&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08828-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A neural mechanism for learning from delayed postingestive feedback&lt;/a&gt;” by Christopher A.

However, it remains unclear how the brain is able to assign credit to flavours experienced during a meal with postingestive feedback signals that can arise after a substantial delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we reveal an unexpected role for the postingestive reactivation of neural flavour representations in this temporal credit-assignment process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To begin, we leverage the fact that mice learn to associate novel, but not familiar, flavours with delayed gastrointestinal malaise signals to investigate how the brain represents flavours that support aversive postingestive learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyses of brain-wide activation patterns reveal that a network of amygdala regions is unique in being preferentially activated by novel flavours across every stage of learning (consumption, delayed malaise and memory retrieval).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining high-density recordings in the amygdala with optogenetic stimulation of malaise-coding hindbrain neurons, we show that delayed malaise signals selectively reactivate flavour representations in the amygdala from a recent meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The degree of malaise-driven reactivation of individual neurons predicts the strengthening of flavour responses upon memory retrieval, which in turn leads to stabilization of the population-level representation of the recently consumed flavour. By contrast, flavour representations in the amygdala degrade in the absence of unexpected postingestive consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, we demonstrate that postingestive reactivation and plasticity of neural flavour representations may support learning from delayed feedback.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 13:59:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE95WVg4TkphcDQ5dzNadnR6THl6Z2hpb3NIUWNqeDczQXJtMVd1T0FSVXJDaVlLd28zNkFIT0dQdkNyM0U2aENfWEhKYXZvRkRhdkxmaUFnei16NFk2WTI4dlhOelJIazd1ZkE</guid></item><item><title>I want to lose 30 pounds and improve my heart health.

              &lt;p&gt;Amanda Bonesteel, a full-time student who has a sedentary lifestyle, told Business Insider that she wants to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/calories-macros-protein-fat-weight-loss-expert-advice-2023-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt; and improve her &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/test-heart-health-simple-exercises-to-live-longer-cardiologist" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 44-year-old, who is based in Michigan, said her goal is to &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/simple-lessons-to-lose-weight-build-muscle-2023-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;lose 30 pounds&lt;/a&gt;. She occasionally goes to the gym but spends most of her time sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She submitted an average day of eating to BI's Nutrition Clinic, where registered nutritionists and dietitians look over readers' diets and offer suggestions based on their goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nichola Ludlam-Raine, a dietitian and the author of "&lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dietitian-wrote-book-ultra-processed-foods-eats-in-a-day-2024-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;How Not to Eat Ultra-Processed&lt;/a&gt;," told BI that Bonesteel is doing some things well, but she could improve her diet in certain areas, such as eating breakfast for more energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="4a30e45c-47aa-422f-9041-3b35ea862600" data-toc-id="4a30e45c-47aa-422f-9041-3b35ea862600"&gt;Eating a balanced dinner&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonesteel starts the day with a coffee with cream and sugar at about 10 a.m. or 11 a.m. For lunch, she has something small like a turkey sandwich, banana, or a bowl of soup.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Her dinners vary but usually consist of a vegetable (such as green beans, cauliflower, or carrots), protein (chicken or lean beef), and carb (whole grains or potatoes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ludlam-Raine said that Bonesteel's dinner sounds balanced and nutrient-dense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Including a protein source alongside a starchy carbohydrate and a generous portion of vegetables is a great foundation for supporting both cardiovascular health and weight loss," she said. "This kind of plate structure offers &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/high-fiber-foods-blue-zones-longevity-diet-includes-nut-bread-2022-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, vitamins, minerals, and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/4-5-rule-hit-protein-target-without-tracking-weight-loss-2024-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; — all of which contribute to satiety, blood sugar regulation, and overall health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="0a1585aa-23ee-471c-a8e6-7f76f831e117" data-toc-id="0a1585aa-23ee-471c-a8e6-7f76f831e117"&gt;Eating less can be counterproductive for weight loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ludlam-Raine said Bonesteel doesn't appear to eat enough overall, which could be counterproductive by reducing her energy levels and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Starting the day with only coffee that includes cream and sugar means she's going for several hours after waking without any real nourishment," Ludlam-Raine said. "This can contribute to low energy and poor concentration, and can sometimes lead to overeating later in the day due to increased hunger or cravings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonesteel's lunch is also very light and may not sustain her for long, especially with her mentally demanding studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If she's not getting enough protein, fiber, or healthy fats earlier in the day, her body may compensate later, potentially leading to larger portion sizes at dinner or snacking in the evening — something that's very common and often overlooked," Ludlam-Raine said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added: "Importantly, under-eating can &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/what-is-metabolism" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;slow down metabolic rate&lt;/a&gt; over time, making weight loss harder, not easier. So, ironically, Amanda might not be losing weight at her desired rate because she's not eating enough during the day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Bonesteel struggles to fit in formal exercise, squeezing in short but regular walk breaks or quick home workouts could be an easier way to boost her movement levels, Ludlam-Raine said.&lt;/p&gt;

"A few simple tweaks could make a big difference to both how she feels and how her body responds."&lt;/p&gt;

These cardiovascular effects—mostly modest increases—were consistent across stimulants and non-stimulants, with guanfacine being the exception, lowering these parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While concerns have been raised about side effects, the benefits of ADHD medications—such as improved academic function and reduced mortality—generally outweigh the risks. The researchers emphasize that regular cardiovascular monitoring should be part of ADHD care, especially in patients with preexisting heart conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small Cardiovascular Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; ADHD meds cause minor increases in heart rate and blood pressure, except for guanfacine, which lowers them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stimulants vs. Non-Stimulants:&lt;/strong&gt; Both types of medications showed similar cardiovascular effects, countering assumptions that only stimulants pose risks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring Urged:&lt;/strong&gt; Authors recommend routine blood pressure and heart rate checks for all patients, regardless of medication type.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Southampton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study led by the University of Southampton has found that medications for ADHD have overall small effects on blood pressure and heart rate after weeks or a few months of use.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been concerns about the side effects of ADHD medications but the new findings, coupled with other studies, suggest that the benefits of taking these medications outweigh the risks, while highlighting the need for careful monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108418"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a heart and pills." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;It is estimated that attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affects around 4 per cent of children in the UK. Of these, around 45 per cent are treated with medication.Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, conducted the largest and most comprehensive analysis of the cardiovascular effects of ADHD medications based on the results of randomised controlled trials – the most rigorous type of clinical study to assess medication effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Samuele Cortese, senior lead author of the study from the University of Southampton said: “When it comes to taking any medication, risks and benefits should always be assessed together. We found an overall small increase in blood pressure and pulse for the majority of children taking ADHD medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Other studies show clear benefits in terms of reductions in mortality risk and improvement in academic functions, as well as a small increased risk of hypertension, but not other cardiovascular diseases. Overall, the risk-benefit ratio is reassuring for people taking ADHD medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), within the framework of the NIHR Research Professorships scheme to Professor Samuele Cortese, with Dr Luis Farhat (University of São Paulo, Brazil) as first author and Professor Alexis Revet (University of Toulouse, France) as co-senior author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder&lt;strong&gt; (&lt;/strong&gt;ADHD) affects around 4 per cent of children in the UK. Of these, around 45 per cent are treated with medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international team of investigators analysed data from 102 randomized controlled trials, including a total of 22,702 participants with ADHD. They used an advanced statistical approach – network meta-analysis – that allowed them to compare the effects of several medications, even when the medications were not directly compared in the trials included in the analysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that all ADHD medications were generally associated with overall small effects on blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters. With the exception of guanfacine (which leads to decreased blood pressure and heart rate), other medications led to increases in the values of these parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No significant differences were found between stimulants (including methylphenidate and amphetamine) and non-stimulants (atomoxetine and viloxazine) with regard to their effects on blood pressure and heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings should inform future clinical guidelines, stressing the need to systematically monitor blood pressure and heart rate, both for stimulants and non-stimulants. This should be particularly relevant for practitioners who might assume that only stimulants have a negative effect on the cardiovascular system,” said Dr Farhat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers say that those with existing heart conditions should discuss the side effects of ADHD medications with a specialist cardiologist before starting treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Revet added: “Our findings, based on randomised controlled trials that tend to be of short duration due to ethical issues, should be complemented by results from real-world, longer-term studies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team will now look to see if some groups might be more vulnerable to cardiovascular side effects than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NIHR Research Professor Cortese concluded: “While our findings are informative at the group level, that is, on average, we cannot exclude that a subgroup of individuals may have a higher risk of more substantial cardiovascular alterations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While it is currently not possible to identify those individuals at higher risk, efforts based on precision medicine approaches will hopefully provide important insights in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychopharmacology and cardiovascular health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c0b3b4a5b6a5eeb7a9acaca9a1adb380b3afb4afaeeea1a3eeb5ab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Steven Williams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://soton.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Southampton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Steven Williams – University of Southampton&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366(25)00062-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Comparative cardiovascular safety of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;” by Samuele Cortese et al. &lt;em&gt;Lancet Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparative cardiovascular safety of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns about the cardiovascular safety of medications used for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) remain. We aimed to compare the effects of pharmacological treatments for ADHD on haemodynamic values and electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters in children, adolescents, and adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched 12 electronic databases, including Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, PubMed, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, from database inception to Jan 18, 2024, for published and unpublished randomised controlled trials comparing amphetamines, atomoxetine, bupropion, clonidine, guanfacine, lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, modafinil, or viloxazine against each other or placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary outcomes were change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), measured in mm Hg, and pulse, measured in beats per minute, at timepoints closest to 12 weeks, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summary data were extracted and pooled in random-effects network meta-analyses. Certainty of evidence was assessed with the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021295352. Before study initiation, we contacted representatives of a UK-based charity of people with lived experience of ADHD—the ADHD Foundation—regarding the relevance of the topic and the appropriateness of the outcomes chosen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;102 randomised controlled trials with short-term follow-up (median 7 weeks [IQR 5–9]) were included, encompassing 13 315 children and adolescents (aged ≥5 years and &amp;lt;18 years; mean age 11 years [SD 3]; of available data, 9635 [73%] were male and 3646 [27%] were female; of available data, 289 [2%] were Asian, 1719 [15%] were Black, and 8303 [71%] were White) and 9387 adults (≥18 years, mean age 35 years [11]; of available data, 5064 [57%] were male and 3809 [43%] were female; of available data, 488 [6%] were Asian, 457 [6%] were Black, and 6372 [79%] were White).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amphetamines, atomoxetine, lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, and viloxazine led to increments in haemodynamic values in children and adolescents, adults, or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In children and adolescents, mean increase against placebo ranged from 1·07 (95% CI 0·36–1·79; moderate CINeMA confidence) with atomoxetine to 1·81 (1·05–2·57; moderate) with methylphenidate for SBP; from 1·93 (0·74–3·11; high) with amphetamines to 2·42 (1·69–3·15; low) with methylphenidate for DBP; and from 2·79 (1·05–4·53; moderate) with viloxazine to 5·58 (4·67–6·49; high) with atomoxetine for pulse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In adults, mean increase against placebo ranged from 1·66 (95% CI 0·38–2·93; very low) with methylphenidate to 2·3 (0·66–3·94; very low) with amphetamines for SBP; from 1·60 (0·29–2·91; very low) with methylphenidate to 3·07 (0·69–5·45; very low) with lisdexamfetamine for DBP; and from 4·37 (3·16–5·59; very low) with methylphenidate to 5·8 (2·3–9·3; very low) with viloxazine for pulse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amphetamines, lisdexamfetamine, or methylphenidate were not associated with larger increments in haemodynamic values compared with atomoxetine or viloxazine in either children and adolescents or adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guanfacine was associated with decrements in haemodynamic values in children and adolescents (mean decrease against placebo of –2·83 [95% CI –3·8 to –1·85; low CINeMA confidence] in SBP, –2·08 [–3 to –1·17; low] in DBP, and –4·06 [–5·45 –2·68; moderate] in pulse) and adults (mean decrease against placebo of –10·1 [–13·76 to –6·44; very low] in SBP, –7·73 [–11·88 to –3·58; very low] in DBP, and –6·83 [–10·85 to –2·81; very low] in pulse). Only four RCTs informed on effects in the medium term and none on the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Practitioners should monitor blood pressure and pulse in patients with ADHD treated with any pharmacological intervention, and not stimulants only. Given the short duration of available randomised controlled trials, new research providing insights on the causal effects of ADHD medications on cardiovascular parameters in the longer term should be funded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Funding&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Institute for Health and Care Research.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 13:34:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5LVHd6TzljNldBaDRWWXN0M0ZQY1hLdk5YY3V0aWxtU21hcW1wOWR3SkZwTzFxeE1CZGFaVUN6Q2R2T2ZPWE5icW5aUDBqeUdIUUZJR2MzTFpLT21UM1U1MmM3SjJVVmRaREdsNEUwNE5saWc</guid></item><item><title>Can a traditional African diet help protect against inflammation? - Medical News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxPN3ZfanhueG5CODRqT0FIU0VNRGVzOUI3RmNhSlp1VEh5LVNZbkRSWVo0VGR5WmdXNm9WMVF1Tkw5YVh3R1BTVXFNU3E4WkN3TktNUHNuV29rMW1pYXJWRjg2SWk2VmRncl9WempTQUhyUk95U29vYzJLOWNvQk1aVS13cTA0cktuUkxjQzVDVHZyUkVoQ2x5Ulk3OHBIVDVpeTFObjJLQlVCbXVGWnBxZENtQVgtS1k?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-yhe8zq"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/04/diet-diseases-GettyImages-564948981-Header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/04/diet-diseases-GettyImages-564948981-Header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/04/diet-diseases-GettyImages-564948981-Header-1024x575.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/04/diet-diseases-GettyImages-564948981-Header-1024x575.jpg" alt="Ethiopian injera with an assortment of savory toppings" class="css-1jytyml"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="icon-hl-pinterest css-11oz8gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalnewstoday.com%2Farticles%2Fdiet-high-in-fiber-fermented-foods-could-keep-inflammatory-diseases-at-bay&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F04%2Fdiet-diseases-GettyImages-564948981-Header-1024x575.jpg&amp;amp;description=Can%20a%20traditional%20African%20diet%20help%20protect%20against%20inflammation%3F" title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/04/diet-diseases-GettyImages-564948981-Header-1024x575.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-13b3g0x"&gt;Switching to a traditional African diet helped protect against inflammation in a new study.

— like traditional &lt;a href="https://oldwayspt.org/explore-heritage-diets/african-heritage-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;African&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324221" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://oldwayspt.org/explore-heritage-diets/latin-american-heritage-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Latin American&lt;/a&gt;

Results were adjusted for factors including age, body mass index, and physical activity levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Their results showed that switching from a traditional African diet to a Western diet for 2 weeks disrupted key metabolic pathways linked to lifestyle-related diseases.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also appeared to trigger a pro-inflammatory state involving &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/327446" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/327446" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;white blood cells&lt;/a&gt;, inflammatory proteins in the blood, and changes in gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, their immune cells became less effective at responding to &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/pathogens-definition" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;pathogens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conversely, transitioning from a Western diet to a mostly plant-based traditional African diet or consuming the fermented beverage resulted in mostly anti-inflammatory effects, including reduced inflammatory markers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain immune and metabolic changes remained four weeks after the intervention, suggesting that even short-term dietary modifications might have some lasting effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study may be the first thorough investigation of the health effects linked to a traditional African diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previous research has focused on other traditional diets, such as the Japanese or Mediterranean diet,” study author &lt;a href="https://www.radboudumc.nl/personen/quirijn-de-mast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Quirijn de Mast&lt;/a&gt;, MD, PhD, internist-infectious disease specialist from Radboud University Medical Center, said in &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1078973" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;a press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, there is just as much to learn from traditional African diets, especially now, as lifestyles in many African regions are rapidly changing and lifestyle diseases are increasing. Africa’s rich diversity in traditional diets offers unique opportunities to gain valuable insights into how food influences health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Quirijn de Mast, MD, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/thomas-m-holland-md-ms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Thomas M. Holland&lt;/a&gt;, MD, MS, a physician-scientist and assistant professor at the RUSH Institute for Healthy Aging, RUSH University, College of Health Sciences, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;He explained that “the shift from a traditional African diet to a Western-style diet resulted in increased inflammation and weakened immune responses, likely due to differences in nutrient composition and microbial exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The traditional African diet in this study was rich in:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These foods are high in &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/146935" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;dietary fiber&lt;/a&gt; and bioactive compounds, such as &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319728#:~:text=Polyphenols%20are%20a%20category%20of,risk%20of%20type%202%20diabetes." class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;polyphenols&lt;/a&gt;, which help reduce inflammation and promote metabolic health. They also encourage a healthy gut microbiome and the production of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9286904/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;beneficial metabolites&lt;/a&gt; that enhance overall health and well-being.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Holland emphasized the potential advantages of traditional African fermented foods and beverages, like Mbege, which “play a critical role by enriching the gut microbiome with beneficial microbes and bioactive metabolites that enhance immune function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that specific compounds present in Mbege, such as &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/flavanoids" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;flavonoids&lt;/a&gt;, also likely contributed to improved immune responses and vascular health in the individuals who consumed the fermented beverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the nutrient-rich traditional African diet, the Western diet in the study lacked whole foods and included items such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;processed meats&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;pizza&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;French fries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;fried chicken&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;refined carbohydrates (like pancakes, spaghetti, and white bread).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holland pointed out that “Western diets are typically high in refined sugars, saturated fats, and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318630" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, which can promote inflammation and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324863" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; and disrupt immune regulation.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This likely results from the direct impact of cholesterol, saturated fats, and sugars on immune and metabolic health, as well as indirect effects through changes in gut bacteria and weight gain, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given that Westernized diets promote chronic diseases, this study’s results are unsurprising—processed foods drive inflammation, whereas healthy traditional diets rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds help mitigate metabolic and immune dysfunction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Thomas M. Holland, MD, MS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study showed promising results, the authors acknowledge a few limitations. These include the short duration of the research, a small sample size consisting only of men, and unrestricted food intake, which may have led to weight changes affecting immune and metabolic profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, Mast emphasized the significant impact of dietary changes, even over just two weeks. He stated that the “study highlights the benefits of these traditional food products for inflammation and metabolic processes in the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the same time,” he said, “we show how harmful an unhealthy Western diet can be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Inflammation is at the root of many chronic conditions, which makes this study highly relevant for Western countries as well,” Mast noted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holland agreed, saying that “these findings reinforce the idea that diet has a rapid and lasting impact on immune and metabolic health.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even short-term dietary changes can have long-lasting effects, suggesting that integrating more traditional, whole-food-based eating patterns could be a key strategy in disease prevention,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Holland noted that “by preserving and adapting traditional plant-rich dietary patterns, individuals can enhance long-term health while maintaining cultural and regional food heritage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 13:20:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxPN3ZfanhueG5CODRqT0FIU0VNRGVzOUI3RmNhSlp1VEh5LVNZbkRSWVo0VGR5WmdXNm9WMVF1Tkw5YVh3R1BTVXFNU3E4WkN3TktNUHNuV29rMW1pYXJWRjg2SWk2VmRncl9WempTQUhyUk95U29vYzJLOWNvQk1aVS13cTA0cktuUkxjQzVDVHZyUkVoQ2x5Ulk3OHBIVDVpeTFObjJLQlVCbXVGWnBxZENtQVgtS1k</guid></item><item><title>The Best and the Worst - The Dispatch</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxPVHRBUG1NcGtCX2wzalJuVHJKd05jWHkwS2VUaEZ1U2tGdDhhXzJ3S0VNUDJmMUx1ODRhMGt1RFg2WklqOHRUVzA4Ni1LZmh0UG14WTN6ZVhiNlgwQzc3c2U1VEhIX3pFaUlyS19QQ3NsRnl5ME1lNW1MX3ZRWFk5MEVsY3A5YmVRQWE0U3NLczg4Q1VhSTZUMlhvcW9fWWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="tight-template drop-cap"&gt;
                &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“None of us is as dumb as all of us,” as the satirical motivational poster puts it. Americans are getting a little taste of that right now, with the American &lt;em&gt;demos&lt;/em&gt; collectively choosing policies that few if any of us (the non-psychopaths, anyway) would have chosen individually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it goes in economics, so it goes elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody would choose to have polio. No father would choose to have his child or children killed or crippled by the horrifying disease. And yet it is the case that the only places in the world where polio is endemic are places that choose to have polio: Afghanistan and Pakistan. Those places have polio because they refuse to allow international medical workers and Rotary Club volunteers (who have been working successfully against polio for nearly a half century) to operate freely and in safety. Perhaps they do not want their children to be maimed by polio. Perhaps they do not want their countries to be poor, ignorant, backward, and weak. But their leaders, such as they are, choose policies that make these outcomes inevitable, and the people give their implicit consent: &lt;em&gt;Q&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ui tacet consentire videtur&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;        


&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afghanistan and Pakistan could be decently governed countries tomorrow if their peoples chose it; they could be as economically prosperous as Poland or Greece in a few decades and as well-off as the median EU country or Canada in a few more years, if they chose the right kind of policies. Hong Kong went from being one of the poorest places in the world—with basically nothing in the way of infrastructure or natural resources—to one of the wealthiest in only a few years thanks to the entrepreneurship of the people and the benign neglect of their British colonial overlords. But, instead, Afghanistan and Pakistan are distinguished from the rest of the world by the fact that their children suffer death and disability because of their refusal to allow their people access to a vaccine that has been available in the rest of the world since Dwight Eisenhower was in the White House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first polio vaccine was developed by Jonas Salk, the son of one of those terrible uneducated immigrants from backwards countries with values alien to our own (his mother was a Jew who had the good luck to get out of Minsk) and a product of that hated “meritocracy” our anti-elitism warriors are always putting sneer quotes around: Being a Jew and coming from a family without money, Salk was effectively excluded from the prep-school-to-Ivy League pipeline but had access to the merit-based—and very competitive—institutions of New York City that were open to people like him: Townsend Harris High School and the City College of New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCNY was free except for the required library card, which went for 50 cents a semester. In one particularly amazing run, the college produced future Nobel laureates in the classes of 1933, 1935, 1937, 1940, 1943, and 1950—and the class of ’37 boasted three of them: Arthur Kornberg, who discovered how DNA is synthesized, along with Jerome Karle and Herbert Hauptman, collaborators who developed methods for determining the structure of molecules that revolutionized fields from pharmaceutical development to materials design. Kornberg was the son of Jewish immigrants from Galicia; Karle, born Jerome Karfunkle, was the son of Jewish immigrants from Poland; Hauptman was the son of a Jewish immigrant from Austria. Hauptman’s father, Israel, had enrolled at CCNY as a young man, too, but had been obliged to leave school to get a job to support his family, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/18/nyregion/one-class-three-nobel-winners-at-city-college.html"&gt;working as a printer&lt;/a&gt;—he carried the torch as far as he could and then passed it to his son. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions and millions of Americans did not want to see that torch carried forward, and hated and despised these foreign-born Jewish printers, shopkeepers, and working men from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_M._Lederman"&gt;Odessa and Kyiv&lt;/a&gt;, these penniless Polish Jews on the Lower East Side with their &lt;a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/medicine/biochemistry-biographies/julius-axelrod"&gt;basket-weaving businesses and barely a word of English&lt;/a&gt;. With just a slight change in the political trajectory of those times, we might have denied ourselves—and our children, and our country—the benefits of the achievements of these men and women, and those of the many millions of the less famous and more ordinary sort of good people, good citizens, good Americans. It didn’t have to be Americans that saved the world from polio and who built so much of the modern world. We could have listened to the Fords and the Lindberghs and the Trumps of the time, who were the Drumpfs of Bad (Very) Dürkheim not that long ago. And, of course, we never really learn: It is of interest to me that so many of our modern Know-Nothings are the Irish American descendants of the very people the original Know-Nothings loathed and feared. And the Know-Nothings weren’t entirely wrong on every point: All those Irish Catholics really did change the political and social character of places such as Boston, whose politics even in our more secular time would puzzle John Adams, who grew up in a Massachusetts where Catholic worship was legally suppressed. I once attended an &lt;a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2025/03/14/evacuation-day-history-boston-massachusetts-revolutionary-war-newsletter"&gt;Evacuation Day&lt;/a&gt; political event in Boston that included an open bar at 7 a.m. and Elizabeth Warren clapping out of time as the crowd sang “Charlie on the MTA,” which I suppose might have played out differently if all those immigrants to Boston had been from Buckinghamshire (or Riyadh) instead of the Emerald Isle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choices are a package deal. They are a bundle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody wants to have measles. No father wants his daughter to get sick and die of an entirely preventable disease, &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/20/texas-measles-family-gaines-county-death/"&gt;but&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We would absolutely not take the MMR,” the mother said in English, referring to the measles-mumps-rubella vaccination children typically receive before attending school. She said her stance on vaccination has not changed after her daughter’s death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The measles wasn’t that bad. They got over it pretty quickly,” the mother said of her other four surviving children who were treated with castor oil and inhaled steroids and recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The couple told [Children’s Health Defense] that their daughter had measles for days when she became tired and the girl’s labored breathing prompted the couple to take her to Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock. There, the girl was intubated and died a few days later. The other children came down with measles after their sister died. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you see “Texas” and “said in English,” you may think the implied alternative is Spanish. In this case, it is Low German, the community in question being Mennonite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Character is destiny,” the wise men say. And I get that, and what it implies, but I do hope it isn’t true. I don’t have a great character, myself, having instead a natural instinct for low things, excess, indolence, and worse. The only hope for people like me is to try to be a better sort of man than we are inclined to be, to be better than our characters, that it should be the case that you are what you do and what you choose. That’s no route to sainthood, either! Not for me, anyway. But it is preferable to the alternative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently spent an afternoon with the best kind of Americans: I was invited to speak about work at the annual conference of Rotary District 7570, a group of Rotary clubs extending from Winchester, Virginia, to Greeneville, Tennessee, across the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Shenandoah Valley, some of the most beautiful country east of the Mississippi. I have nothing but good things to say about Rotarians, and not only because they gave me a scholarship when I was a senior in high school and was desperate for money for college. (The University of Texas was not very expensive, but it wasn’t CCNY’s 50 cents a semester, either.) The Rotary clubs include my favorite kind of slightly dopey, well-meaning, public-spirited Americans—who are, of course, precisely the sort of people who can change the world when they get a mind to do so. For the Rotarians, that has most famously taken the form of working to eradicate polio, which they have come very close to doing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rotary anti-polio project is a quintessentially American undertaking of the best kind. In the 1970s, polio vaccines had been around for a while, they had long been established to be safe and effective, they were not very expensive, and, thanks to the work of Albert Sabin (formerly Abram Saperstejn of Bialystok, Russia, who arrived in America with his parents on the SS &lt;em&gt;Lapland&lt;/em&gt; in 1921 but attended New York University rather than City College), they were easy to administer in the form of oral drops. But there was still a lot of polio in the world. All that was needed was to raise billions of dollars from pancake breakfasts and the like and to organize millions of volunteer man-hours to deliver and administer polio vaccines around the world to people who needed them, working with local governments and non-government partners—easy! There wasn’t any mystery about how to do it—it just needed doing. Sometimes, you need a genius like Jonas Salk or Albert Sabin to do the complicated thing that nobody knows how to do. And that’s a problem, because you never know where to &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; a genius like that, even among those unglamorous families of blue-collar New York Jewish immigrants that seemed to be absolutely teeming with them in the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. You can’t plan on a genius just showing up—genius works on its own schedule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, sometimes, you don’t need a genius—you just need somebody to volunteer to organize that pancake breakfast. And when you just need somebody to do the thing, that’s when you want the Rotarians and millions of other Americans in similar organizations. My friend Tim Carney, who gave a much better and more extensive talk at the same Rotary meeting, talked about the importance of institutions in both big projects such as polio eradication and in private matters, such as adult friendships, which tend to overlap with our participation in institutions of various kinds, from churches to book clubs to business associations. As Carney wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Alienated-America-Places-Thrive-Collapse/dp/0062797107"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alienated America, &lt;/em&gt;these institutions are profoundly important for healthy private and public lives&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rotarians organized their first polio vaccination project, in the Philippines, in 1979. Since then, they have raised &lt;em&gt;billions&lt;/em&gt; of dollars to vaccinate nearly 3 billion children in 122 countries. Their efforts have attracted support from governments who understand what a force multiplier American pancake-breakfast organizers can be and from figures such as Bill Gates, whose foundation has for years been providing $2-to-$1 matching funds for the polio project, meaning that the Rotarians’ $50 million in annual fundraising produces $150 million in working funds every year. The thing about this kind of work is that work works: Polio cases worldwide have been reduced by 99.9 percent since the Rotarians took on the disease. These are good people doing good things—no mystery, no radical scientific breakthrough, just consistent hard work by people who have nothing personally to gain by saving children from paralysis in Nigeria. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to emphasize the contrast here: On one hand, we have those Americans in the Rotary clubs and others like them, who do hard things competently and with humility, dedicating years of selfless effort toward getting it right on one big thing; on the other hand, we have a class of American gadflies who are endlessly self-aggrandizing, who live only for their own status and wealth, whose only credo is “What’s in it for me?” and who are, in spite of their posturing as hard-headed realists, the most absurd gang of chiseling incompetents ever to bring such an abbreviated attention span to bear on the nation’s problems, who wreck institutions and alliances and Ebola-control programs simply because they refuse to do their homework, and who have managed to destroy more than $7 trillion in wealth in only a few days while setting fire to a system of international economic and security cooperation that was built over the course of decades by better and more capable men than these misfits could ever hope to be. The Rotarians don’t talk about politics at their meetings, but there is a politically meaningful contrast to be seen there: between the best kind of Americans and the worst kind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-economics-for-english-majors"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economics for English Majors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the subject of those trade relationships, I have a slight disagreement with Jonah Goldberg, who argued on a &lt;a href="https://thedispatch.com/podcast/remnant/the-guinness-world-record-of-self-sabotage/"&gt;recent podcast&lt;/a&gt; that there is a reasonable case, if not necessarily a convincing one, for enacting anti-Chinese tariffs on national security grounds. I think Jonah is wrong about that: There isn’t any national security case for tariffs at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If trade with China is a national security problem—or if trading with China in some particular product or commodity is a national security problem—then the answer still isn’t a national sales tax on U.S.-based companies that import Chinese goods. If you want to prohibit trade with China in &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;, then the thing to do is to prohibit trade with China in &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;z. &lt;/em&gt;You give them the Huawei treatment, which is a good way of discovering how important your market actually is. (&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/opinion/trump-tariffs-china.html"&gt;How’s that working out?&lt;/a&gt;) One could imagine a serious project to bring China to heel when it comes to the theft of intellectual property (which is a real problem) and the like: trade prohibitions, economic sanctions, an effort to expel China from the World Trade Organization, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tariffs are no part of that, because tariffs do not have that effect and, in many cases, will have no effect at all on Chinese producers, who mainly sell to U.S.-based distributors rather than to U.S.-based consumers. A big tariff on Chinese-made flip-flops might be a problem for the company that supplies them to Walmart, and it might be a problem for Walmart, but it isn’t necessarily a problem for the guys at the Chinese flip-flop factory. Buyers don’t have to buy your stuff, but sellers don’t have to sell you their stuff, either. There’s a big, wide world out there, with billions of feet all but crying out for cheap flip-flops. You think some Chinese firm is going to just pony up to cover an American firm’s new taxes … because? What’s the U.S. firm going to do? It’s not going to buy its flip-flops from a nonexistent U.S. flip-flop factory, and with tariffs on every overseas source, it doesn’t necessarily improve its tax position by switching from Chinese sandal suppliers to Vietnamese or Bangladeshi or &lt;a href="https://www.ralphlauren.com/men-footwear-shoes/handwoven-leather-sandal/0045227113.html"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tariffs do one thing—and are intended to do that one thing and nothing else: They give politically connected domestic firms an opportunity to raise their prices by removing lower-priced substitutes from the marketplace entirely or by putting upward pressure on the prices of those substitutes. What’s dumb—I mean, there’s a lot that’s dumb in this, but here’s one big dumb thing—is that most of the Trump administration’s tariffs will land on products that do not compete with U.S.-made goods, so they simply will put upward pressure on the prices of products that have no domestic substitutes in the market—with any pricing advantage going to other overseas firms. If there aren’t any flip-flop factories in the United States, then a tariff on Chinese flip-flops is just a subsidy to flip-flop producers in countries subjected to a tariff rate lower than the one applied to their Chinese competitors. And that may be good news for flip-flop entrepreneurs in Cambodia or Bangladesh or wherever (and who knows where the rates will be in 24 hours?) but all it means for Americans is higher prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is more obvious if you consider an extreme case. We aren’t going to let Chinese firms design the guidance chips for American nuclear ICBMs. That’s a real, obvious national security risk. So, how do we go about keeping that from happening? With a 5 million percent tariff on Chinese-made ICBM guidance systems? No. We just forbid the use of them in U.S. military goods. Tariffs are simply the wrong tool for the national security job. You can sharpen a pencil and tape it to the barrel of a rifle, but you’d be better off with an ordinary bayonet, if that’s what you need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-words-about-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Words About Words&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Item A: In a recent &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/03/28/putin-trump-imperial-ambitions-ukraine/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; column&lt;/a&gt;, Fareed Zakaria wrote that Russian forces had “leveled the Chechen capital of &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/12/1085861999/russias-wars-in-chechnya-offer-a-grim-warning-of-what-could-be-in-ukraine"&gt;Grozny&lt;/a&gt; to the ground.” I asked what I thought was an obvious question: What else would Grozny have been leveled to if not the ground? Putin’s desk? The height of the average elderberry bush? The column has since been amended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Item B: &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; headline: “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/business/dollar-tree-family-dollar-sale.html"&gt;Dollar Tree Is Selling Family Dollar for $1 Billion&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Call me old fashioned, but isn’t that like $999,999,999 too much? Either everything’s a dollar or it isn’t. Oh, I know, I know. But you thought the same thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Item C: Michelle Cottle, writing in the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/opinion/jason-crow-democrats.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has discovered a Democratic congressman who supports gun control, Jason Crow of Colorado. Which doesn’t seem like much of a discovery to me, but, she adds: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Crow also grew up hunting “everything that flies or walks or runs through the woods,” and he recognizes the importance of hunting in many people’s lives. “For us to ignore that and to write that off or to malign it — and for some Democrats literally not to know what the hell they’re talking about,” he said, “is unforgivable.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thing about the Second Amendment is: It has &lt;em&gt;not one expletive deleted thing to do with hunting, you rather more florid expletive deleted nincompoops&lt;/em&gt;. Do you really think our Founding Fathers wrote a frickin’ &lt;em&gt;hobby&lt;/em&gt; into the Bill of Rights? Like it or not, the Second Amendment is paramilitary in character—it references the militia, not Elmer Fudd. Americans are not going to abandon their civil rights because some Democrat in the Denver suburbs once shot a whitetail. “For some Democrats literally not to know what the hell they’re talking about is unforgivable.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt Taibbi deserves to win his &lt;a href="https://www.racket.news/p/a-response-to-a-member-of-congress"&gt;libel lawsuit against Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove&lt;/a&gt;, a California Democrat who baselessly smeared him as a “serial sexual harasser.” The claim is simply fabricated. I disagree with Taibbi about a great many things and kind of suspect I wouldn’t like him if I knew him, but the habit—still more pronounced among Democrats—of inventing sexual misconduct allegations as a way of smearing critics and those with differing political opinions is dishonorable, unseemly, and profoundly corrosive to democratic discourse. It is poison when the abuse is directed at our friends, and it is poison when it is directed at those who are not our friends. A member of Congress should not be permitted to defame critics in this way. As a legal matter, Taibbi’s case is on solid ground; as an ethical matter, Sydney Kamlager-Dove owes him—and her congressional colleagues—an apology. Taibbi is right to defend himself in this way, and more people should follow his example. It is the only way to draw a line that has a chance of being respected. &lt;/p&gt;

After enrolling, more than 106,000 adults were invited to participate in the sub-study on physical activity. The final sample, stratified into five groups, or quintiles, of physical activity levels, included about 85,000 participants with a median age of 63 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XLFYPEMYH5AWNGSRPSI6RVM7G4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study had participants use an accelerometer &lt;b&gt;— &lt;/b&gt;a device that measures movement&lt;b&gt; — &lt;/b&gt;for seven days to measure sedentary time, step count and activity intensity, and to quantify daily levels of activity and energy expenditure. The measures were compared with&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the initial diagnosis of 13 cancers associated with low physical activity: bladder, breast, colon, endometrial, esophageal, upper stomach, head and neck, kidney, liver, lung, myeloid leukemia, myeloma and rectal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="T7WSEV6RRBGHTJKHTY7CT7Y26E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The research identified an inverse relationship between overall daily physical activity and cancer risk, indicating that even modest increases in activity levels were sufficient to significantly reduce the risk of the 13 cancers.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-key-inflammation-marker-is-lower-in-people-who-meditate-research-finds"&gt;Meditating&lt;/a&gt; can help you relax in the short term, but if you stick with it, it might also steel you against the effects of chronic stress and aging, a new study finds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined gene expression, cognitive function, and hair &lt;span&gt;cortisol &lt;/span&gt;levels in people who have been practicing &lt;a href="https://www.tm.org/what-is-tm"&gt;Transcendental Meditation&lt;/a&gt; (TM) for either 12 or 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to control groups of similarly aged people who don't meditate, those with four decades of experience practicing TM showed reduced biomarkers for chronic stress and biological aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The lower expression of age-related genes and lower hair cortisol in the TM groups extend the findings of short-term studies indicating these practices lead to healthy aging and more resilient adaptation to stress," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1078719"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; physiologist Kenneth Walton from Maharishi International University in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TM has ancient origins in the Vedic religious tradition of India, but the modern incarnation was developed and popularized in the 20th century by spiritual leader Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, &lt;span&gt;commonly known as the Maharishi.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The method involves silent repetition of a personal &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantra"&gt;mantra during&lt;/a&gt; two daily 20-minute sessions. Certified instructors follow a standardized system created by the Maharishi to teach TM techniques, sometimes called technologies of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/consciousness" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73104" data-postid="157159" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;consciousness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This study provides evidence that long-term practice of TM technologies has a broad range of health benefits at the molecular level," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1078719"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; molecular physiologist Supaya Wenuganen, from Maharishi International University (MIU), which was &lt;a href="https://www.miu.edu/about-miu"&gt;founded&lt;/a&gt; by the Maharishi in 1971.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1648-9144/57/3/218"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt;, Wenuganen and colleagues found 200 differentially expressed genes between TM practitioners and non-meditators. Suspecting potential health benefits from those discrepancies, they sought to learn more with their new investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expression of genes linked with inflammation and aging was lower in TM practitioners, the new study found. That includes the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCS3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SOCS3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; gene, which is associated with chronic stress as well as energy metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reduced expression of these genes suggests people who meditate may carry a lighter &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/has-the-news-got-you-down-these-brain-exercises-keep-you-feeling-stress-free"&gt;allostatic load&lt;/a&gt;, or the cumulative effects caused by chronic stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results also fit with previous findings &lt;span&gt;suggesting&lt;/span&gt; TM can improve energy metabolism efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it's important to note these findings don't show direct cause and effect. Those who practice TM may also be more likely to possess another unknown trait that's responsible for the associated benefits, or to be generally more health-conscious, than those who don't practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers used electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings to look at cognitive function, another variable known to decline with age. The findings revealed that older TM practitioners had cognitive processing speeds similar to those of younger subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-term practitioners of TM also scored higher on the "Brain Integration Scale" (BIS), a metric designed to encompass various cognitive abilities such as attention and reaction time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The findings around cognitive function are particularly exciting," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1078719"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biopsychologist Frederick Travis of MIU. "Both younger and older TM practitioners showed higher scores on the BIS compared to non-meditators. The older meditators performed on par with young controls."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This reinforces the findings on evoked potential responses," he &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1078719"&gt;adds&lt;/a&gt;, "further suggesting a protective effect against cognitive decline with age."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers measured hair concentrations of the steroid hormone &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol"&gt;cortisol&lt;/a&gt; along with its inactive precursor, cortisone, finding the ratio of active to inactive forms was lower among TM practitioners than non-meditators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This too hints at &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stress-hormones-can-now-be-detected-in-real-time-from-a-single-drop-of-blood"&gt;lower stress levels,&lt;/a&gt; and supports other findings that link regular TM practice with reduced stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Cortisol plays a critical role in the body's response to stress, and chronically high cortisol levels are associated with a host of age-related health issues in addition to cognitive decline," Walton &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1078719"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The reduced cortisol-to-cortisone ratio in meditators suggests they have more adaptive reserve, more resilience, contributing to overall health and longevity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/15/3/317"&gt;Biomolecules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In a new study of individuals aged 65 and over, those living in England’s most polluted areas consistently scored lower on cognitive assessments, especially in language-based tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest air pollution may impair specific brain regions, such as the temporal lobe, which governs language processing. Researchers call for stronger air quality regulations to protect aging populations from cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Older adults exposed to high levels of NO₂ and PM2.5 showed the most significant declines in language-related cognitive tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pollution Sources Matter:&lt;/strong&gt; Emissions from industry, home heating, and fuel combustion were strongly linked to poorer language performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Region Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings suggest air pollution may affect the temporal lobe, essential for semantic fluency and language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-term exposure to high levels of air pollution may harm the brain health of older adults in England, finds a new study led by UCL researchers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;The Journals of Gerontology: Series A&lt;/em&gt;, found that exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) and fine particulate matter (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) is linked to lower scores in key cognitive abilities, particularly language skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108414"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows the outline of a person, a brain and smoke stacks." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The authors did not examine the reasons behind their findings but suggest that this may be because increased air pollution exposure is most strongly associated with impairment in the temporal lobe (the part of the brain which is essential for language and semantic fluency).

PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5 &lt;/sub&gt;pollution in outdoor air often originates from the combustion of gasoline, oil, diesel fuel, or wood, and consists of tiny particles that can be inhaled deeply into the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analysed data from 1,127 adults aged 65 and over who took part in the ELSA Harmonised Cognitive Assessment Protocol (ELSA-HCAP) in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team examined exposure to air pollution over an eight to 10 year period (2008-2017) and assessed participants’ memory, executive function (i.e. making plans, solving problems and adapting to new situations), language, and overall cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed a range of well-established neurocognitive memory assessments such as the “East Boston Memory Test” and the “Wechsler Memory Scale”, alongside immediate and delayed recall, backwards counting tasks, and shape drawing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings showed that individuals residing in areas with the highest levels of NO₂ and PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; performed worse on cognitive tests compared to those living in areas with average pollution levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most compelling evidence of association was observed in language skills, with individuals in the most polluted areas scoring in the bottom third of the cognitive tests performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that different sources of air pollution have varying effects on cognitive health. For example, pollution from industries, home heating, and combustion of fuels (like coal and oil) were strongly linked to poorer language performance (i.e. the ability to access and produce words quickly).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors did not examine the reasons behind their findings but suggest that this may be because increased air pollution exposure is most strongly associated with impairment in the temporal lobe (the part of the brain which is essential for language and semantic fluency). Further research is needed to understand these links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Dr Giorgio Di Gessa (UCL Epidemiology &amp;amp; Health) said: “Our study shows that air pollution is not just harmful to the lungs and heart but also to brain health, especially when people are exposed to high levels for long periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most consistent links we found were with language ability, which may indicate that certain pollutants have a specific effect on particular cognitive processes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the researchers urge policymakers to strengthen air quality regulations, particularly in areas where pollution levels remain high, to help protect brain health as the population ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deputy director of the ELSA study, Professor Paola Zaninotto (UCL Epidemiology &amp;amp; Health), said: “By tracking pollution levels over a decade using high-quality data, our research provides robust evidence that sustained exposure to pollutants is damaging people’s brains.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ELSA is funded by the National Institute on Aging and by UK Government Departments coordinated by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study limitations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The air pollution data used in the study only covers 10 years, which may not accurately represent lifetime exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, yearly averages of pollution levels were used, missing short-term high exposure impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the study sample is small and limited to England, which may not reflect broader trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this pollution and cognition research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#24540a504b494657645147480a45470a514f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Poppy Tombs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucl.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Poppy Tombs – UCL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gerona/glaf060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cognitive performance and long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution: Findings from the Harmonised Cognitive Assessment Protocol sub-study of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA-HCAP)&lt;/a&gt;” by Giorgio Di Gessa et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Journals of Gerontology Series A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive performance and long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution: Findings from the Harmonised Cognitive Assessment Protocol sub-study of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA-HCAP)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although air pollution is associated with worse cognitive performance, whether these relationships differ by cognitive domain and which sources of air pollution are particularly detrimental to cognition remains understudied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study examined associations between cognitive scores across three domains in older adults and 8-10 years of exposure to air pollutants (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, total PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;, and PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; from different emission sources).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used data from the 2018 Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol sub-study of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (N=1,127). Outdoor concentrations of each pollutant were estimated for 2008/10-2017 and summarised using means and group-based trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linear regression models were used to assess long-term air pollution exposure relationships with memory, executive function, language, and global cognitive function after adjustment for key individual and neighbourhood-level confounders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associations between air pollution trajectories and cognition are mostly inverted j-shaped, with respondents exposed to the highest residential levels of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and total PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; having worse performance for global cognition [β=-0.241; 95%CI=(-0.46,-0.02) and β=-0.334; 95%CI=(-0.55,-0.12) respectively] than those exposed to average levels of pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar associations were also found for executive function and memory (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; only), whereas more compelling dose-response evidence was found for language. Higher emissions from industry and residential combustion, as well as biofuel, coal, oil and natural gas combustion, were associated with worse language scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air pollution and its sources have domain-specific associations with cognitive performance, with most consistent evidence observed for language. Continued efforts to reduce air pollution, particularly where levels are the highest, might benefit cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 12:52:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTFAwMkg5SzRFeUV1SDAxeDFmY2hZaVp4YkNZVjY5ZXJFOTlyeWxCMzloNFJrZGpWWmtJWWV5MWpTVGIxa3lGMU9GZjQxTGVvc0l4dGkzNUE5OGdBYjJ3dWZFaEZrOUgyNVRKQkE</guid></item><item><title>AI is coming to skin cancer detection - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxObGJ6UFVjc2ZIRmRZQlQ5MmVUY2hwTVFpdGlQRF9HOHEtZEJRZThsbU5BNkNjbXpzUTVLcWJKXzVpcFJRNWUzeVg3elhnQTEtWGhNRTA1RlVfUjBsYVNLSE94bThJa01UN2dpODBtaDhZZXJnVlhQY08tVkNDb1NUdS1GSHB4OVR1RkFUS2g4QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JP5CA6QOZVBK7JYJE3VU5CM6ZU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A future where artificial intelligence will guide skin cancer detection is in sight, experts say, even as human care remains essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AMTTQWR32JFK5ELAGJQTNFOO3M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The whole ecosystem has really matured and we are now past the hype and the big media headlines,” says Ivy Lee, a Los Angeles-based dermatologist who chairs the Augmented Intelligence Committee at the American Academy of Dermatology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Z7WZTAMB6VGPLN3T6FNS5WIFPI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A 2017 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28117445/" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;

Because of the volume and quality of the photographs, they’re “super challenging” for a dermatologist to interpret, she explains. “So this is a huge opportunity for AI.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FV7XJGEL75ADPHR6OQBD66VWKM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some companies offer services like this already, but the experts note that they have not seen any publicly available data that proves their efficacy or regulatory status in the United States or abroad. Daneshjou adds that there may be companies doing trials that would then apply for FDA clearance. “I do think it is coming down the pipe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OZALPMMK5RDGDEWENEPRTS4SHM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Lee also says there could be a future where these full-body scans are made widely accessible — and that would be a positive. “Anything to improve access to screening and to high-quality care is something we need to do better at,” she says. That would require solid scientific evidence that shows it’s safe, cost-effective and equitable, as well as regulatory work to ensure it’s sustainable and scalable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="CN2T3AY5PVC7PE36ZSKPZQRS3M" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="CN2T3AY5PVC7PE36ZSKPZQRS3M"&gt;Not ready for prime time&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UC6L2IYQUZCRZMYR5YVP5D6N6M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But experts advise against using apps and chat bots to diagnose skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="INZI4KRAMNALLJD3DBGIIUOCDI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It’s actually quite problematic because [these apps] have not cleared any regulatory hurdles, and some of them are making claims around being able to diagnose skin cancer and there’s no actual available data to back up their claims,” says Daneshjou, who co-wrote a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2815800" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; on the topic in JAMA Dermatology&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;in 2024 with Rotemberg and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QBV4ZYNEFJD6JFEHF4P3Q7OIFE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Mobile apps and chatbots may be “dangerous because oftentimes we turn to these tools as patients because we can’t get access to health care,” Lee says, adding that data privacy and security should also be a concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BO7NJWQZFVH3LFJGEQWNHHV4FE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Experts also do not recommend using ChatGPT and other large language models to analyze your skin lesions. “What we have found from prior work is that these models don't do that great on skin cancer diagnosis,” Daneshjou says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MOQ2NN7YZRGVBJEIZZDEVQYLH4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Rotemberg says direct-to-consumer products remain the “furthest away” from being useful for patients, although it’s “a very promising area.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XRGENJQJOBDQXEXC33M4FFWPTM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As of now the gold standard is to get an annual skin check with a dermatologist, Lee says.

                Researchers hope AI can help with the shortage of mental health providers.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;New research suggests that given the right kind of training, AI bots can deliver mental health therapy with as much efficacy as — or more than — human clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The recent&lt;a href="https://ai.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/AIoa2400802" target="_blank"&gt; study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, shows results from the first randomized clinical trial for AI therapy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers from Dartmouth College built the bot as a way of taking a new approach to a longstanding problem: The U.S. continues to grapple with an &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/12/06/1217487323/psychologists-waitlist-demand-mental-health-care" target="_blank"&gt;acute shortage&lt;/a&gt; of mental health providers. "I think one of the things that doesn't scale well is humans," says Nick Jacobson, a clinical psychologist who was part of this research team. For every 340 people in the U.S., there is just one mental health clinician, according to &lt;a href="https://mhanational.org/news/mha-releases-2024-state-of-mental-health-in-america-report/" target="_blank"&gt;some estimates.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;While many AI bots already on the market claim to offer mental health care, some have &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/10/nx-s1-5222574/kids-character-ai-lawsuit" target="_blank"&gt;dubious results&lt;/a&gt; or have even &lt;a href="https://www.apaservices.org/practice/business/technology/artificial-intelligence-chatbots-therapists#:~:text=APA%20met%20with%20federal%20regulators,director%20of%20health%20care%20innovation." target="_blank"&gt;led people to self-harm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More than five years ago, Jacobson and his colleagues began training their AI bot in clinical best practices. The project, says Jacobson, involved much &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/01/19/1147081115/therapy-by-chatbot-the-promise-and-challenges-in-using-ai-for-mental-health" target="_blank"&gt;trial and error&lt;/a&gt; before it led to quality outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The effects that we see strongly mirror what you would see in the best evidence-based trials of psychotherapy," says Jacobson. He says these results were comparable to "studies with folks given a gold standard dose of the best treatment we have available."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The researchers gathered a group of roughly 200 people who had diagnosable conditions like depression and anxiety, or were at risk of developing eating disorders. Half of them worked with AI therapy bots. Compared to those that did not receive treatment, those who did showed significant improvement.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of the more surprising results, says Jacobson, was the quality of the bond people formed with their bots. "People were really developing this strong relationship with an ability to trust it," says Jacobson, "and feel like they can work together on, on their mental health symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Strength of bonds and trust with therapists is one of the overall predictors of efficacy in talk and cognitive behavioral therapy.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Another advantage of AI therapy is the lack of time constraints. Jacobson said he and his team were surprised by how frequently patients accessed their AI therapists. " We had folks that were messaging it about their insomnia symptoms in the middle of the night," he says, "and getting their needs met in these moments."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The American Psychological Association has raised the alarm recently about the &lt;a href="https://www.apaservices.org/practice/business/technology/artificial-intelligence-chatbots-therapists#:~:text=APA%20met%20with%20federal%20regulators,director%20of%20health%20care%20innovation." target="_blank"&gt;dangers of using unregulated AI therapy bots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the organization says it's pleased with the rigorous clinical training that researchers invested in this model.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The therabot in this study checks a bunch of the boxes that we have been hoping technologists would start to engage in," says Vaile Wright, director for the Office of Health Care Innovation at the APA. "It is rooted in psychological science. It is demonstrating some efficacy and safety, and it's been co-created by subject matter experts for the purposes of addressing mental health issues."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dartmouth researchers stress that the technology is still a long way from market and say they need to run additional trials on the therabot before it will be widely available.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And, Wright says, human therapists should not be intimidated by their AI counterparts. Given the tremendous shortage of mental health providers, " I don't think humans need to be concerned that they're going to be put out of business," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She says the country needs all the quality therapists we can get — be they human or bot.&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, experts say it can even &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/stress-anxiety-positive-psychology-happiness-health" target="_blank"&gt;be healthy&lt;/a&gt; to some degree. However, you don’t need a medical degree to know that experiencing chronic stress can wreak havoc on your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, of course, is mostly due to the &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/balancing-cortisol-tips"&gt;stress hormone&lt;/a&gt; cortisol: “Cortisol rises in response to demanding situations or perceived threats,” notes psychologist &lt;a data-offer-url="https://pilarguerra.es/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://pilarguerra.es/"}' href="https://pilarguerra.es/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pilar Guerra Escudero&lt;/a&gt;. “Our body is designed to release cortisol in a timely manner, but the problem arises when cortisol levels remain chronically elevated. This can impact the &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/simple-ways-to-support-your-immune-system" target="_blank"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;, sleep, and mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get an idea of just how detrimental this excess of cortisol can be, consider the explanation given by aging expert &lt;a data-offer-url="https://shawellness.com/en/noticias/europes-top-doctor-in-healthy-ageing-is-at-sha-according-to-the-european-awards-in-medicine/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://shawellness.com/en/noticias/europes-top-doctor-in-healthy-ageing-is-at-sha-according-to-the-european-awards-in-medicine/"}' href="https://shawellness.com/en/noticias/europes-top-doctor-in-healthy-ageing-is-at-sha-according-to-the-european-awards-in-medicine/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Vicente Mera&lt;/a&gt;. “Cortisol decreases immunity as severely as the treatments we use in transplant patients or patients with autoimmune diseases,” he writes in his book &lt;em&gt;Young At Any Age&lt;/em&gt;, noting that it can even bring out latent infections or other illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it’s not just the stress hormone cortisol that can impact our wellbeing—low levels of feel-good hormones like endorphins and serotonin can also drastically affect our emotions and mood. After all, these substances increase feelings of euphoria and, in turn, help mitigate stress and naturally relieve pain. To truly improve the way we feel, we must therefore lower cortisol while increasing serotonin and endorphins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to lower cortisol, easily&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, experts say that engaging in just a handful of specific activities and habits each day can do both. And, no, it’s not just about meditation—though, of course, meditation has &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/easy-tips-to-feel-energized-through-meditation" target="_blank"&gt;tons of benefits&lt;/a&gt;. However, “physical activities such as swimming can be highly effective in reducing cortisol, sometimes even more so than meditation—especially if the latter generates frustration or is difficult to maintain over time,” explains Guerra Escudero. “It all depends on the person— meditation has been shown to be effective in lowering cortisol levels, but if someone finds it difficult or stressful, the attempt to meditate may be counterproductive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why movement can be just as effective. “Exercise offers a more accessible way to reduce stress without the person having to force themselves to quiet the mind,” she notes. “It allows for a more natural distraction and release of tension because, unlike meditation—which requires a conscious effort to focus the mind—physical activity encourages spontaneous disconnection from stressful thoughts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiV0FVX3lxTE1FbVRPQ0F2Tk9nUUQxdFdJRzFrVGtOY19RQm91ejhJUENyNFhBRGJ6cm1EczM4Zk16V1I3dTd4Qy15Y1lxUGFYODRUcGdGTjhOQ3dDSVRGbw</guid></item><item><title>How Many Miles Should You Walk Per Day For Weight Loss? - Women's Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxOdWNqNUtma0kxcVpPdmQ2bUhqNHBERnd4MDhPQVpBQmdnZWdNandIMGpYdENaNUpGaDNfUW83VHl1UlU2bl9XeDA4TUdzSURkSXo4dlQ4cDJjWmJ4d0FkX1dpb25oaGRNZzJ1SHprMlM4aWRrcldFOUx5RjFnVElWYkdPTjR1T01xWFJLRDRpelNnS0dVb3pEaDg0QWR4VEEzYXBHNXNCdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-j4k1z9 et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="0" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62950868/yes-walking-is-a-cardio-workout/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62950868/yes-walking-is-a-cardio-workout/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Walking" data-node-id="0.0" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Walking&lt;/a&gt; has a whole bunch of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62638370/health-benefits-of-walking/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62638370/health-benefits-of-walking/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="benefits" data-node-id="0.2" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62007446/can-walking-keep-you-fit/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62007446/can-walking-keep-you-fit/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="improving cardiovascular health, mood, and sleep" data-node-id="0.4" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;improving cardiovascular health, mood, and sleep&lt;/a&gt;—but exactly how many miles do you need to walk per day to get these perks? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;You might have heard that 10,000 steps—which ends up being about five miles—is the daily goal you should shoot for. But this number might be more arbitrary than you think. In fact, though this rule of thumb has been around since the 1960s, there’s little *scientific* evidence that walking 10,000 steps should be your target, according to a 2022 review in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00302-9/fulltext" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00302-9/fulltext" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Lancet" data-node-id="1.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="1.1.0"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (We aren’t exactly sure what the origin of this popular step goal is, but it could be partly due to the fact that the Japanese character for 10,000 looks like a man walking, as &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62598280/accidental-step-count-scam/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62598280/accidental-step-count-scam/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Women's Health reported previously" data-node-id="1.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="1.3.0"&gt;Women's Health&lt;/em&gt; reported previously&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Luckily, there is some science that helps clarify what a good step goal is, and, the good news: it’s lower than 10,000 per day.

But, when it comes to getting the most out of the activity, walking anywhere from 6,000 to 7,500 steps was found to reduce all-cause mortality for women over 60, according to the 2022 &lt;em data-node-id="6.3"&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; review. Meanwhile, for those younger than 60, step-count benefits didn’t plateau until 8,000 to 10,000 steps. Beyond all-cause mortality, a higher step count—this time just under 10,000 steps—was found to be associated with a lower risk of dementia, though benefits were observed with as few as 3,800 steps per day, according to a 2022 study in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2795819" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2795819" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="JAMA Neurology" data-node-id="6.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="6.5.0"&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="7.0"&gt;Read more:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64404557/how-many-miles-should-you-walk-for-weight-loss-health/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64404557/how-many-miles-should-you-walk-for-weight-loss-health/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" Best Walking Shoes" data-node-id="7.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt; &lt;em data-node-id="7.1.1"&gt;Best Walking Shoes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Basically, there’s a range of how many steps you should shoot for, and you could see benefits even &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62706109/walking-lifespan-study/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62706109/walking-lifespan-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="walking short distances" data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;walking short distances&lt;/a&gt;, depending on your experience level. One thing to keep in mind is that the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20current%20Physical,See%20steps%20for%20getting%20started." data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20current%20Physical,See%20steps%20for%20getting%20started." data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="CDC recommends" data-node-id="8.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; that adults get 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous-intensity exercise per week, so if walking is your main form of exercise, you want to make sure that you’re hitting this number of minutes—no matter what the mileage is, says Alexander Rothstein, CSCS, an exercise physiologist and instructor for the exercise science program at New York Institute of Technology.  This might mean walking for about 22 minutes every single day or for 30 minutes, three days a week. Since time is what matters here and everyone walks at a different pace, there’s a range of how many steps and miles this would shake out to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Something else experts want you to consider is that when it comes to walking for better health, &lt;em data-node-id="9.1"&gt;frequency&lt;/em&gt; is also super important. “With walking, you’re looking for this to be as many days of the week as you can,” says Laura A. Richardson, PhD, a professor of applied exercise science at the University of Michigan. It’s all about finding a step count that’s sustainable—as in, it won’t leave you too sore and tired the next day—which will be different for everybody based on their fitness level. Start with fewer miles and then increase over time to create a more sustainable routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="body-tip css-13fzjfi emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="10.0"&gt;Aim for: &lt;/strong&gt;anywhere between 2,000 and 8,000 steps per day—which is between one and four miles. Keep in mind that the frequency of your walks and the total time you spend walking per week is also important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="11" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="11.0"&gt;How Many Miles You Should Walk Per Day For Weight Loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;If &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a62749835/how-you-can-lose-weight-by-walking/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a62749835/how-you-can-lose-weight-by-walking/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="weight loss" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; is your goal, answering this question really shifts to focusing on energy expenditure, both experts agree. Increasing distance or intensity are both ways to turn up the amount of energy you’re using on a walk, but if you’re looking to lose weight, just walking might not be the most efficient and effective way to go. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Strength training, as well as more varied exercise than just daily walking, would be most effective. Not to mention, so many other factors like genetics, nutrition, and environment contribute to weight loss. When it comes to walking though, one 2018 study in &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.22171" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.22171" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Obesity" data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="13.1.0"&gt;Obesity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that 10,000 steps did enhance weight loss, especially if 3,500 of those steps were performed at a higher intensity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="body-tip css-13fzjfi emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="14.0"&gt;Aim for: &lt;/strong&gt;closer to two miles (and up to five) at a higher-intensity speed. But remember that walking alone might not be enough to see weight loss results, and strength training and nutrition are key. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="expert-tricks-for-getting-more-miles-in-every-day" data-node-id="15" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.0"&gt;Expert Tricks For Getting More Miles In Every Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Focusing on breaking up sedentary time, or the time that you spend not moving, also has important health benefits that might be more important than your total distance walked per day, Rothstein says.

By studying the data of &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/virus-likely-triggers-almost-all-multiple-sclerosis-massive-study-concludes-62236" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;10 million former military personnel&lt;/a&gt; in the US, Ascherio’s work showed that MS is almost always a delayed response to infection with the EBV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="blockquote--content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[T]he epidemiology of multiple sclerosis is quite unique because there is a very striking geographical distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="reference"&gt;Professor Alberto Ascherio&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers had known that there was something odd about the development of MS, and attributed it to the so-called hygiene hypothesis. This is the idea that in our modern world, children are not getting enough early exposure to microorganisms in order to develop a healthy immune system. However, finding the connection was not easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It started with the observation that the epidemiology of multiple sclerosis is quite unique because there is a very striking geographical distribution,” &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/alberto-ascherio/" target="_blank"&gt;Professor Ascherio&lt;/a&gt; told IFLScience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is very uncommon in tropical areas, and then the incidence tends to increase in temperate zones. For people who migrate from areas of high incidence to low incidence, the risk goes down, and for people who migrate from the tropics to Europe or Canada, the risk goes up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This prompted Ascherio to look at something in the environment or lifestyle that could explain this distribution. Untangling the issue with the hygiene hypothesis, Ascherio noticed the connection between infectious mononucleosis, primarily caused by EBV, and the risk of developing MS. Over time, overwhelming evidence linking the two has been brought forward, although the exact mechanism is not fully clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One popular theory is that it's a cross-reactivity between the immune response against the EBV and some human proteins that are expressed in the brain,” Professor Ascherio explained. “The hypothesis is attractive because it would provide sort of a straightforward explanation, but I'm rather skeptical about this explanation. An alternative explanation is that the disease is caused by viral reactivation in the central nervous system in the brain or spinal cord.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between the virus and disease has opened new ways to consider how MS might be treated. Antiviral drugs are being investigated in clinical trials as possible add-ons to the standard MS treatment. There’s also the possibility that a vaccine might be useful, in particular, one that modifies the immune response, and so maybe stops MS completely. Ascherio is upfront that this development won’t be a matter of months, but of many years, though he’s optimistic that there is “a lot of research that hopefully will bring us somewhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="blockquote--content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's like we've built the equivalent of JWST to study the universe, but now we don't have the funding to launch it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="reference"&gt;Professor Alberto Ascherio&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a bit of hesitation there, but it has nothing to do with the scientific challenges. Instead, it is because of the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/the-us-government-just-cut-10000-jobs-dismantling-its-safety-net-for-americans-health-78656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;devastating cuts to research&lt;/a&gt; into cures for diseases by the Trump administration, through Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, and Health Secretary Robert F.

Unfortunately, we are struggling to get funding to move forward with this research. It's like we've built the equivalent of JWST to study the universe, but now we don't have the funding to launch it!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Breakthrough Prize, worth $3 million, will be split equally between Ascherio and Hauser, and hopefully, more contributions will continue to push this vital area of medical research forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 09:58:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxQOVJmRVJUYmpkODcwcVQ4dWRXNXAzUXN3Z3RmMllfYkYwQzM4U1BnUXBOMFZYWnh5aERIMHJhYlRTdExFRmVZUkxLMXZoTEZnSEpZcjFlNHJMU2kzTHcyRFNxcC02U2FwSTJ4dk5URkx3bXNxNWlOWjF5UF91WEJJMmt5V0NrdE94S1pBNkNnU3EwMWw2VFBmRl9NZXl4YkRZdDFzblJzc2pudkhEbTdTU2gyMjhzaUU</guid></item><item><title>Rare virus that killed Gene Hackman’s wife kills three in small California town - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxPbmpSOVFWUUd0WkJfdk1WTDc3UnM3QUNFRHlldXRYcVJONGt2NDJ3TmhsTTZFWUFXd21kMUhLZUFUVThFZ1RzV0JiZHZCX1F2T0EwTjJQSU5yY1RtODloanJJMEhTazh2Zml4dkxtN0tpdVhUZEh5VHlwdXZrcTlwY1dqVTluZzNmQzBHeXI0YlpCQzQ5Z1kzbXlhOUYtanFkWWE3cg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 fsDBBo sc-jbiisr-1 gfSVvz" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 cwDkqf" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 guIZJM"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 ghpvHl"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 dyeFNc"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 QyvDf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 hjfIlW"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 bXNazX sc-hez36s-16 eFHwkn"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 lpmrWp"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 kHOfxf"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 llSPWP"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 ctaaNX"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 zTiwj"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

Scores which are below the average could indicate a risk for poor health outcomes, such as falls. For example, for a person aged between 60-64, the average is 14 for a man, and 12 for a woman. If you are aged 85-89, however, the average score is eight. However, these average scores do not take into account a person's medical history – for example if they have recently undergone surgery or have an injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The test can also be beneficial for younger people or those with no health conditions, as it is a good measure of fitness, particularly lower body muscular strength and endurance. Researchers in Switzerland asked almost &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00038-013-0504-z" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;7,000 adults&lt;/a&gt; to do the STS test and then compared the results. They found that the average score for 20–24-year-olds was 50/minute for men and 47/minute for women. Some of those taking part, however, were able to perform as many as 72 repetitions in a minute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In another study &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2018/01050/the_relationship_of_sit_to_stand_tests_with.18.aspx" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;of healthy volunteers&lt;/a&gt;, who had an average age of 21, researchers found a strong association between the results of the sit-to-stand test and a different – but more time-consuming – measure of their aerobic capacity and endurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Research shows that how well you perform on the test can also tell healthcare providers a great deal about your underlying health. For example a low score on the test can be used to identify people who might be at risk of worse outcomes after &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33356620" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;surgery&lt;/a&gt; or after &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11215763/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;cancer treatment.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), if a person scores less on the test than the "average" for their age group then they are also at &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/steadi/media/pdfs/STEADI-Assessment-30Sec-508.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;greater risk of falls.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"What we're really worried about is that if people don't maintain their strength, their balance, their flexibility and their cardiovascular health, then they're more likely to fall," says Dhesi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;About 30% of people aged over 65 have a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/scorecard/8135" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;fall every year,&lt;/a&gt; and that rises to about 50% in people aged over 80 years. Once people have had one fall, they often become scared of falling again, making them less likely to go out, sometimes leading to social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"If you're worried about falling, you're not [necessarily] going to go out and meet people and do other things.

Individuals who scored low on the test were between five to six times more likely to die over a six-year period than those who scored highest.

From there, you could move to standing up perhaps five times every hour or two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;If you are able, simply walking up and down your living room and making sure that you are going up and down the stairs at least three or four times a day can also make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"You want to avoid 'bungalow legs' [i.e. weak legs from living in a single-storey home] – essentially you want to make sure you can carry on going up and down stairs using those muscles, maintaining your balance, and remaining independent," says Dhesi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dhesi also advises people to go out and join exercise classes if they can. Many gyms run exercise programs for seniors at low cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The added benefit there is the social contact on top of the physical contact. And we know that that's a really important aspect of as you get older – loneliness and social isolation can really be detrimental for your health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Finally, other tips include keeping moving and doing housework. For older adults, playing with your grandkids if you have them – getting down on the floor with them, and getting up off the floor with them – can be helpful.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Colon cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide, and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/03/20/1163697875/colon-cancer-signs-screening-young-adult" target="_blank"&gt;it's on the rise among younger adults &lt;/a&gt;in the U.S. But&lt;a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cncr.35727" target="_blank"&gt; research recently published in the journal Cancer,&lt;/a&gt; finds regular exercise can help survivors live longer — in some cases, even longer than people who've never had colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think the important message is, some level of activity is better than staying inactive," says &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/find-a-doctor/jeffrey-a-meyerhardt" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jeff Meyerhardt,&lt;/a&gt; co-director of the Colon and Rectal Cancer Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the study's senior author. He says the results suggest exercise can have a "meaningful impact" on a patient's long-term prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;When it comes to colon cancer, the good news is that overall, death rates have been falling thanks to improvements in screening and treatment. But survivors still tend to have a shorter life expectancy than people of the same age and sex in the general population, in large part because of the risk that the cancer will come back.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Meyerhardt says researchers have long known that exercise can improve survival rates in colon cancer patients. But he and his colleagues wanted to know if regular physical activity could actually help patients improve their survival rates compared to people who'd never had cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;So they surveyed nearly 3,000 colon cancer patients about their exercise habits before and after treatment. What they found was that, for patients who were three years out from treatment and cancer free, regular exercise made a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Those patients not only had a better overall survival if they were more physically active, they actually looked like they had a slightly better overall survival compared to the general population," Meyerhardt says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even patients whose cancer recurred had improvements in survival if they had more regular exercise compared to patients who were the least physically active.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Patients who saw benefits were exercising the equivalent of walking about an hour a day at a 2-to-3 mile per hour pace about six days a week, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://profiles.dom.pitt.edu/faculty_info.aspx/Schmitz7385" target="_blank"&gt;Kathryn Schmitz&lt;/a&gt; is an exercise oncology researcher at the University of Pittsburgh and the director of the Moving Through Cancer Program at UPMC Hillman Cancer Center. She's a firm believer in the power of exercise both to reduce the risk of dying from colon cancer and to prevent it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I know of nothing else that is within the patient's control that is more powerful for reducing cancer mortality, particularly colon cancer mortality, than physical activity," Schmitz says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers are still trying to figure out the mechanisms at play. But Schmitz says evidence from animal models suggests that physical activity triggers a series of chemical reactions in cells that promote health in multiple ways.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What you might think of is that all of our cells are bathed in a soup of sorts, and the constituents of that soup change as a result of being more physically active," Schmitz says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When you're sedentary, your immune system doesn't work as well, and your cells are more prone to inflammation, which can cause cells to mutate, she says. But when you exercise on a regular basis, your inflammation goes down and your immune function is better.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The soup in which your cells are bathed is healthier in a way that will tamp down any cancer development or cancer progression," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Exercise &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/14/nx-s1-5108843/exercise-fat-healthy-weight-obesity" target="_blank"&gt;can also improve insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;, and insulin plays a role in spurring the growth of colorectal cancer cells, says &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/find-a-doctor/kimmie-ng" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Kimmie Ng&lt;/a&gt;, founding director of the Young Onset Colorectal Cancer Center at Dana-Farber.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And at a time when colon and rectal cancer &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/03/20/1163697875/colon-cancer-signs-screening-young-adult" target="_blank"&gt;rates are rising among people under 50&lt;/a&gt;, it's more important than ever to get the word out about exercise.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ng says researchers don't know exactly what's driving the "alarming" rise in cancers of the colon and rectum in adults under 50, but research suggests colorectal cancer is strongly linked to several modifiable lifestyle factors like diet and physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Out of all these factors, Ng says, "exercise probably has some of the strongest data supporting the benefits of it being protective" — both in terms of developing colorectal cancer and surviving it. And while exercise is beneficial at any age, the younger you start the better.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We do think that exercise, starting in childhood and adolescence, also seems to be very important for protecting against a future risk of developing colorectal cancer as an adult," Ng says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Guidelines from the&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/diet-physical-activity/acs-guidelines-nutrition-physical-activity-cancer-prevention/guidelines.html#:~:text=Most%20children%20and%20young%20adults,should%20be%20limited%20at%20home." target="_blank"&gt; American Cancer Society recommend&lt;/a&gt; people get 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity each week to reduce the risk of cancer. But if that seems like more exercise than you have the time or energy for, something is always better than nothing, Schmitz says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"If you are able to do 90 minutes more than you're currently doing, then that is a win," Schmitz says. "If you're able to do 60 minutes more than what you're currently doing, that is a win. Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Getting off the couch to begin with is a win."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edited by Jane Greenhalgh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s cuts to staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and to clinical trials now threaten to unwind that progress, affected CDC researchers and outside HIV experts warn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/01/cdc-rif-2400-layoffs-rfk-jr-hhs-reorganization-rapid-response-capability-weakened/"&gt;“reductions in force” last week at the CDC&lt;/a&gt; gutted branches responsible for a slew of prevention services: Expert guidance on preventing infant infections, a national &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/director-letters/launch-of-together-takemehome.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;at-home testing program&lt;/a&gt;, long-running &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv-data/mmp/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;surveys&lt;/a&gt; to follow people &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/director-letters/launch-of-together-takemehome.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;living with and at risk&lt;/a&gt; for HIV, statistical analysis to estimate national HIV incidence, and guidelines on how to use HIV prevention drugs or PrEP, including a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2025/04/01/trump-cuts-pepfar-threatens-rollout-gilead-hiv-prevention-drug-lenacapavir/"&gt;powerful new medicine&lt;/a&gt; likely to be approved this summer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;STAT has also learned that funds have been suspended for the HIV Prevention Trials Network and the HIV Vaccine Trials Network, the two most prominent networks for testing prevention drugs and vaccines. Funds have also been suspended for the AIDS Clinical Trial Group, a nearly 40-year-old system that has been responsible for key breakthroughs dating back to the first effective AIDS drug, AZT. All three have been waiting on money that were supposed to be sent out in February. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The HPTN paused a study testing four interventions to prevent HIV in Black men who have sex with men in the South, a particularly vulnerable group. The ACTG paused enrollment for all of its studies except one for lack of funds, said Joe Eron, the group’s chair. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The one spared study has now also been paused for other reasons, Eron said, meaning the network is now essentially in a holding pattern. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous reports also noted that funding was canceled last month for an adolescent trial system that has been active since 2001. Smaller grants for perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00969-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;hundreds&lt;/a&gt; of other smaller HIV studies were also cut, seemingly because many focused on people of color, men who have sex with men, or transgender individuals. Cancellation letters reportedly argued such studies were examples of “DEI,” or diversity, equity, and inclusion, and “often used to support unlawful discrimination on the basis of race.” Researchers counter that such groups are the most at risk for HIV or the most medically underserved.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The HHS Office of Infectious Diseases and HIV/AIDS Policy has also &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00969-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; been slashed. The cuts of people and funds are collectively stoking deep alarm among HIV researchers and doctors across the country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What we’re seeing can only be summarized by the words chaos and terror,” said Colleen Kelley, chair of the HIV Medicine Association. “Our terror is that we’re going to see increases in HIV infections, increases in deaths from AIDS, increases in babies being born with HIV.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The exact toll to date is difficult to quantify. So far, core federal programs to provide HIV treatment, including through the 1990 Ryan White CARE Act, appear intact. So does Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S., or EHE, the ambitious program Trump launched during his first administration. But the cuts, along with &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/03/medicaid-cuts-republicans-paragon-say-to-focus-on-waste-fraud-and-abuse/"&gt;Republican-floated plans to slash Medicaid&lt;/a&gt;, have physicians and advocates concerned more is to come.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They also come alongside an &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/01/trump-administration-sued-decision-rescind-billions-covid-19-public-health-funding/"&gt;attempt to claw back Covid recovery funds&lt;/a&gt;, a move that — while &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/03/federal-judge-temporarily-block-billions-health-funding-cuts-states/"&gt;currently blocked by a court order&lt;/a&gt; — has &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/02/cdc-hhs-cuts-nyc-infectious-disease/"&gt;imperiled&lt;/a&gt; jobs at local public health departments, potentially impeding services to those living with or at risk of HIV. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think we can keep our heads in the sand any longer,” said Anu Hazra, director of STI services for the Chicago Center of HIV Elimination. “Nothing is safe in this administration, whether treatment or care.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services did not directly respond to a list of detailed questions.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“HHS is following the Administration’s guidance and taking a careful look at all divisions to see where there is overlap that could be streamlined to support the President’s broader efforts to restructure the federal government,” spokesperson Vianca N. Rodriguez Feliciano wrote. “This is to ensure that HHS better serves the American people at the highest and most efficient standard.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The cuts to HIV work struck many researchers as darkly ironic, given the first Trump administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/02/05/can-the-us-end-the-hiv-epidemic-in-a-decade-as-trump-pledged/"&gt;goal of ending the epidemic by 2030&lt;/a&gt;. Although not on track for that lofty ambition, EHE helped reduce infections by 12% as of 2021, by flooding resources into high-risk counties. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This was working,” said John Brooks, who served as chief medical officer for the CDC’s division of HIV prevention until last year. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The exact toll of last Tuesday’s cuts was never announced, but&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;five&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;branches of the CDC’s HIV prevention division appear to have been effectively eliminated, according to more than a half dozen affected employees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These cuts actually leave intact “the division’s core functions,” said Brooks. That includes the surveillance team that counts new cases, an outbreak response team, and a team responsible for administering funds to states.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lost, though, were a long list of critical support and research, former employees and outside experts said. That includes a prevention communication branch that conducts public awareness campaigns and outreach to providers, as well as a quantitative science branch that employed mathematical modelers, statisticians, and economists to estimate national HIV incidence, determine where best to deploy limited resources, and assist in laboratory studies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear now whether the CDC has the expertise required to even estimate the size of the epidemic. “No more statisticians are there to support the national HIV incidence,” said one affected employee.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gone, too, is a behavioral and clinical surveillance branch that has long conducted two surveys on people living with and people at risk of HIV. It provided key data on what people need to access and stay on treatment or prevention services. “Without this data, we will provide worse care,” said Gretchen Newman, director of the HIV clinic at Wayne State University in Detroit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since January, one affected employee told STAT, the staff had spent much of their time trying to comply with an executive order demanding they scrub references to transgender individuals from the data in order to assure the overall project could continue. “We were doing all this meticulous fine-tuning,” they said, “and now it’s for nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The employee pointed out, with exasperation, that such efforts aligned with health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s focus on chronic disease. Much of the group’s recent work focused on preventing cancer and heart disease in adults growing older with HIV.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A roughly 40-to-50-person research branch that ran studies and mined health records to examine the best way to deploy new prevention tools, such as PrEP, was also cut. It included a decades-long &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7235508/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that was abruptly terminated in February, without a clear plan for informing subjects, according to a source, as well as work on how to get new long-acting injectable drugs to Black women in the South, who are most at risk of HIV. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What’s being lost … is the expert staff to make sure we know what’s working best to prevent HIV,” said Brooks. “Whether federal dollars are reaching the right people and are working, if there are gaps where prevention services are needed and how to most strategically spend that money.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;An affected research branch employee put it in starker terms. The agency “will no longer be able to track HIV prevention progress,” the employee said, noting their extensive efforts to understand how key tools are being deployed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Secretary Kennedy had said the cuts would be strategic and that scientists would not be fired,” they added. This “is the opposite of what the administration claimed it aimed to do.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research branch also ran a pilot program to ship out a million at-home HIV tests, giving many access to cheap, discreet, and fast diagnostics. And it included central efforts to reduce mother-to-child transmission, an effort that has &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10387171/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;appeared&lt;/a&gt; spectacularly effective but not complete. Between 30 and 40 &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/151/5/e2022059604/191071/Achieving-Elimination-of-Perinatal-HIV-in-the?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;babies&lt;/a&gt; still contract HIV every year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The fact that we still have perinatal transmission is a travesty,” said Carlos Del Rio, co-director of the Emory Center for AIDS Research. The CDC experts “were following every case, figuring out why and what we can do to [prevent] future cases.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The status of all of these programs remains unclear. They have not, seemingly, been formally defunded. But it’s not clear who would now administer them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NBC News reported on a plan &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-administration-considers-plan-eliminate-cdcs-hiv-prevention-divi-rcna196946" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;floated&lt;/a&gt; to move some prevention work into the Health Resources and Services Administration, which has long administered the Ryan White program for treatment. And a spokesperson &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/04/hiv-trump-cuts-prep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the Washington Post that some efforts would be moved into a proposed new agency, Administration for a Healthy America. But no specifics have been offered. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the government wants to try to be more efficient, that’s fine, said Mitch Warren, head of the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, “but how are you making sure the programs continue? They haven’t said a word about that.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, doctors and advocates are most concerned about prevention. Although the epidemic is far less deadly than it once was, its impact has remained remarkably unequal. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It continues to have a disproportionate impact on young Black and Latino gay men, as well as transgender women, among other groups. That’s in part been driven by disparate access to tools such as PrEP. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the underserved community … we are experiencing an epidemic of HIV that has never really stopped,” said Dial Hewlett, a medical director at the Westchester County Department of Health. “Less than 40% of eligible adults are receiving PrEP. In underserved communities, less than 10% are receiving PrEP.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The EHE program had provided resources to 57 of the nation’s highest-risk jurisdictions, in part to fund such efforts. And in June, regulators are also expected to approve &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2025/04/01/trump-cuts-pepfar-threatens-rollout-gilead-hiv-prevention-drug-lenacapavir/"&gt;lenacapavir&lt;/a&gt;, a new form of PrEP that has been shown to offer virtually complete protection from HIV with just a single administration every six months. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CDC researchers had been preparing guidance for how clinicians should deploy the drug. That team is now essentially gone. Their departures and the cuts elsewhere have researchers concerned the new drug could be deployed as unevenly as the last.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know,” said &lt;a href="https://med.emory.edu/departments/medicine/divisions/infectious-diseases/profile/?u=JCOLASA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Jonathan Colasanti,&lt;/a&gt; an infectious disease researcher at Emory. “It has the potential to end the epidemic if we do it right, if the resources are there. Only if it reaches the people who need it the most.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A pending Supreme Court decision could also unwind rules, imposed by the Biden administration, requiring insurers to cover PrEP. Even if coverage continues, uptake could be restricted if the CDC or government-funded entities aren’t allowed to direct efforts toward specific groups, such as transgender people. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These moves have disappointed and angered researchers, who saw the focus on HIV as a rare medical bright spot from Trump’s first term. Some wonder if the decisions could be driven in part by Kennedy’s past &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/robert-f-kennedy-jr-2024-presidential-campaign-democratic-primary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; denying that HIV causes AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They also say that it is, from a financial standpoint, remarkably inefficient. Treatment is far more expensive. The CDC estimated it saved $5 billion by averting 9,000 infections between 2017 and 2021. Researchers had hoped tools like lenacapavir and continued funding could avert thousands more. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It baffles me and disappoints and upsets me,” Del Rio said of the blows to the HIV prevention infrastructure, “because we could end the HIV epidemic in our country if we do the right things.”   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

For over a century, scientists have hypothesized that neurons are the only cells involved in storing and recalling memories. Now, researchers from Baylor College of Medicine have discovered that another cell in the brain may play a crucial role in memory as well. Their study showing that star-shaped brain cells called astrocytes are also involved in forming and recalling memories won the 2025 STAT Madness popular vote. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 1904, a German zoologist and memory researcher named Richard Semon made a prediction about how memories were stored in the brain. Semon hypothesized that memories were kept in ensembles of neurons he called engrams, which became reactivated when memories were recalled.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s only been in the last several decades that scientists have been able to prove that Semon’s theory is correct — partially. Baylor’s team found that astrocytes, cells that are in close physical proximity to neurons and help with neurotransmission, are also an essential part of the engram.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“An engram is now comprised of multiple ensembles, you have an ensemble of neurons and an ensemble of astrocytes,” said senior author Benjamin Deneen, the Dr. Russell J. and Marian K. Blattner Chair at the Center for Cancer Neuroscience at Baylor. “They work hand in hand.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 2025 STAT Madness competition, a bracket-style celebration of biomedical research, stacked 64 entries against each other in a month-long competition. The contest garnered 374,302 votes for topics that included a new &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ado7082" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;gene-editing technique that can turn off prions&lt;/a&gt; that cause diseases like mad cow, and a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07016-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;light-powered pacemaker&lt;/a&gt; thinner than a strand of hair. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the Baylor team, which included co-first authors and postdoctoral associates Michael Williamson and Wookbong Kwon, won with 63.6% of the 92,001 votes in the final round, making this the medical school’s &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/05/stat-madness-2024-baylor-wastewater-monitoring/"&gt;second successive Madness championship&lt;/a&gt;. Baylor beat a team from Florida International University that studied the feasibility of functional precision medicine in treating pediatric cancers.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A team from NYU’s School of Global Public Health won the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/21/stat-madness-stat-summit-award-won-by-nyu-school-of-global-public-health/"&gt;STAT Madness All-Star Award last month&lt;/a&gt;, voted on by attendees at the Breakthrough Summit East, for research finding higher rates of deep sedation in Hispanic patients hospitalized with respiratory failure, which may help explain why Hispanic people are twice as likely to die from respiratory failure than other similar patients. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;To showcase astrocytes’ role in memory, the Baylor team honed in on a gene called c-Fos, which plays an important role in neuron plasticity. The researchers found that about 4% to 5% of astrocytes express the same c-Fos gene. The researchers dubbed these astrocytes learning-associated astrocytes, or LAAs, and tagged the cells to study them using a viral vector. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers used genetically modified mice and conditioned them to feel fear. When the mice were put in new situations, they didn’t freeze up in fear like they normally did — until the LAAs were activated. “Our interpretation of that was that the mice were having sort of an artificial memory,” Deneen said, that “is stored in part in the astrocytes.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08170-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; was published in the journal Nature last November, and was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health, the National Research Foundation of Korea, and the David and Eula Wintermann Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study does have limitations, the authors acknowledge. While the gene has been well studied in neurons, there is very limited research on the gene in astrocytes, and the scientists aren’t sure why some astrocytes express the gene, while others don’t. “God only knows what c-Fos means in an astrocyte,” Deneen said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since the study’s publication, the authors have continued to research astrocytes’ roles in memory, including trying to understand the changes that occur in astrocytes that exhibit the c-Fos gene. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Can all astrocytes become engrams?” Deneen said, “Or are there preordained or specialized astrocytes that are more prone or more likely to become an engram? We don’t know the answer to that.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team from Florida International University took second place with research showing that functional precision medicine (FPM) can be done quickly and improves outcomes for pediatric cancer patients. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Normally, cancer patients need to rely on a doctor’s expertise to decide what treatment to try. FPM, which combines cancer genomic profiling with drug sensitivity testing, takes some of the guesswork out of finding the best drug to fight each patient’s individual cancer. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The method had already been shown to work in adults, but Diana Azzam, the scientific director of the Center for Advancing Personalized Cancer Treatments at FIU’s Robert Stempel College of Public Health &amp;amp; Social Work, wanted to see if it could be helpful for pediatric patients with relapsed and hard-to-treat cancers for which few treatment options exist. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We demonstrated that we could generate functional precision medicine data and return results to a tumor board quickly enough to make a decision for the next line of treatment,” Azzam said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Azzam’s study had two objectives: to see if the FPM approach could be done quickly enough to be useful, and to see if patients who took drugs recommended by the FPM testing would have better clinical outcomes than they did before participating in the study.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team found that it could quickly conduct all the testing required for the FPM method, completing drug sensitivity testing and genomic profiling within 10 days and 27 days, respectively. This was fast enough for the team to come up with actionable treatment recommendations before too many of the children’s cancers progressed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the drug sensitivity testing, Azzam and her team exposed the children’s cancer cells to 125 FDA-approved drugs, including cancer drugs, allergy medications, and statins. Azzam said that one of the important results of the paper is showing that some of these drugs had anticancer properties and were indicated as treatments against relapsing and hard-to-treat cancers. “Repurposing of these drugs is key,” Azzam said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the drug sensitivity and genomic tests, the team was able to make individualized treatment recommendations for 19 of the 25 patients enrolled in the study. Only six patients took the FPM-recommended drug, but those that did had a much higher likelihood of progression-free survival compared to patients that went back to their doctor’s treatment plan. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of those six patients was &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/11/pediatric-cancer-functional-precision-medicine/"&gt;Logan Jenner&lt;/a&gt;, a young boy with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia. Testing revealed a specific mutation that could be targeted with medication, and he has been cancer-free for more than two years.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-02848-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;was published in Nature Medicine last April and was  funded by the Florida Department of Health. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are limitations to the study, Azzam said. The sample size was small, at only 25 patients, and did not include a randomized control group. In order to limit bias, the researchers used each patient as their own control, comparing their cancer progression after their choice to pursue FPM to their progression before the trial. Those that used the FPM-guided treatment substantially improved. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is a proof of principle study,” Azzam said, “to really show that this is feasible and we can scale it up.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Azzam’s ultimate goal is to use FPM testing for rare cancers before they progress and relapse. She imagines a world where children — and adults — diagnosed with cancers such as osteosarcoma or glioblastoma can get quick FPM testing to determine the best treatment option immediately. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She’s kickstarting the process by working to open a CLIA-certified lab in Florida that will take samples from patients nationwide and perform FPM testing. “It’s going to be the first commercial lab to provide functional precision medicine, along with artificial intelligence, to guide treatments for relapsed, refractory patients,” Azzam said, “not only children, but also adults.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's normal to experience changes in our mobility as we get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people find movements like touching their toes or getting up from the sofa start to feel more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to offset this is through regular movement. But which exercises are the most effective for maintaining strength and mobility as you age?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Rachel Lennon, Pilates instructor and founder of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/wellnesstribe_retreat/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/wellnesstribe_retreat/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;The Wellness Tribe&lt;/a&gt;, there's one simple move that everyone should do for longevity: the glute bridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The bridge is such a good exercise for spinal mobility and core activation and strength and it also works the glutes," Lennon says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best part?

"Moving up and down through this movement will mobilize the spine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthens the glutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The glutes are the biggest muscle in the body so we want to be working them regularly," Lennon explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Builds core strength&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The 30-second hold will really engage your muscles, particularly your core," Lennon adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A strong core is essential for supporting your entire body and providing strength for everyday movements like putting shopping away overhead and carrying heavy bags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a stronger core can also help you maintain an upright posture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it fun&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's easy to make this movement feel like fun. "Put some music on and do your reps to the beat," suggests Lennon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making movement uplifting and lighthearted is important to ensure you develop a healthy relationship with exercise, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Australians are being urged to roll up their sleeves for a flu vaccine amid &lt;a href="https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/perfect-storm-of-infection-first-quarter-flu-cases-hit-high-20250401-p5lo84.html"&gt;rising cases of influenza&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an opportune time to think about other vaccines too, particularly because some vaccines can be given at the same time as the flu vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One is the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines/coadministration.html"&gt;COVID vaccine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-react-class="Tweet" data-react-props='{"tweetId":"1908127701669396828"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Should you get another COVID shot?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than five years since COVID was declared a pandemic, we hear much less about this virus. But &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/australian-respiratory-surveillance-report-24-february-to-23-march-2025?language=en"&gt;it’s still around&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024 there were &lt;a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/articles/deaths-due-covid-19-influenza-and-rsv-australia-2022-january-2025"&gt;4,953 deaths&lt;/a&gt; involving COVID. This is nearly 20% lower than in 2023, but still nearly five times that of influenza (1,002).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vaccines, which do a very good job at reducing the chances of severe COVID, remain &lt;a href="https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/contents/vaccine-preventable-diseases/covid-19"&gt;an important tool&lt;/a&gt; in our ongoing battle against the virus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case numbers don’t tell us as much about COVID anymore as fewer people are testing. But based on other ways we monitor the virus, such as &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/topics/covid-19/monitoring-and-reporting#covid19-impact-on-hospitals"&gt;cases in ICU&lt;/a&gt; and active outbreaks &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/topics/covid-19/monitoring-and-reporting#covid19-impact-on-residential-aged-care-homes"&gt;in residential aged care homes&lt;/a&gt;, there have essentially been two peaks a year over recent years – one over summer and one over winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean we can predict exactly when another wave will happen, but it’s inevitable and may well be within the next few months. So it’s worth considering another COVID vaccine if you’re eligible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Who can get one, and when?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several risk factors for more severe COVID, but some of the most important include being older or immunocompromised. For this reason, people aged 75 and older &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/covid-19-vaccines/getting-your-vaccination"&gt;are recommended to receive&lt;/a&gt; a COVID booster &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/ministers/the-hon-mark-butler-mp/media/older-australians-urged-to-get-new-covid-booster"&gt;every six months&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the slightly younger 65 to 74 age bracket, or adults aged 18 to 64 who are immunocompromised, booster doses are recommended every 12 months, but people are &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/covid-19-vaccines/getting-your-vaccination"&gt;eligible every six months&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healthy adults under 65 are eligible for a booster dose every 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healthy children aren’t recommended to receive boosters but those who are severely immunocompromised may be eligible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What COVID shots are currently available?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen &lt;a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/products/covid-19/covid-19-vaccines/covid-19-vaccines-regulatory-status"&gt;multiple types of COVID vaccines&lt;/a&gt; since they first became available about four years ago. Over time, different vaccines have targeted different variants as the virus has evolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some vaccine providers may still offer other options, such as the older booster that targeted the Omicron variant XBB.1.5, the &lt;a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/we-now-know-when-a-new-covid-vaccine-will-be-released-should-you-get-a-booster/x3wdpuaam"&gt;recent JN.1 booster&lt;/a&gt; is the most up-to-date and best option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a relatively recently updated version to improve protection against some of the newer strains of COVID that are circulating. The new booster only became available in Australia in late 2024. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This booster, as the name suggests, targets &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/the-emergence-of-jn-1-is-an-evolutionary-step-change-in-the-covid-pandemic-why-is-this-significant-220285"&gt;a subvariant called JN.1&lt;/a&gt;. Although JN.1 has not been the dominant subvariant in Australia for some time, this shot is still expected to provide good protection against circulating subvariants, including new subvariants &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/a-new-covid-variant-is-on-the-rise-heres-what-to-know-about-lp-8-1-253237"&gt;such as LP.8.1&lt;/a&gt;, which is descended from JN.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it’s great we have an updated booster available, unfortunately &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/topics/covid-19/monitoring-and-reporting#covid19-vaccinations"&gt;uptake remains poor&lt;/a&gt;. Only &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/covid-19-vaccine-rollout-update-14-march-2025?language=en"&gt;17.3% of people&lt;/a&gt; 75 and over had received a COVID vaccine in the six months to March. &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/senior-caucasian-man-holding-shirt-sleeve-1192750759"&gt;Steve Heap/Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Getting a flu and COVID shot together&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data from &lt;a href="https://ausvaxsafety.org.au/covid-19-vaccines/pfizer-jn1-covid-19-vaccine-safety-data-all-participants"&gt;more than 17,000 people&lt;/a&gt; who completed a survey after receiving the JN.1 booster shows that while 27% reported at least one adverse event following vaccination, the majority of these were mild, such as local pain or redness or fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only 4% of people reported an impact on their routine activities following vaccination, such as missing school or work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you choose to get the flu vaccine and the COVID vaccine at the same time, they’ll usually be given in different arms. There shouldn’t be a significant increase in side effects. What’s more, getting both shots at the same time &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9746457/"&gt;doesn’t reduce your immune response&lt;/a&gt; against either vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is the ideal time to get your flu vaccine. If you’re eligible for a COVID booster as well, getting &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines/coadministration.html"&gt;both vaccines at the same time&lt;/a&gt; is safe and can be very convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re conducting &lt;a href="https://www.materresearch.org.au/news-publications/news/2024/october/mater-launches-trial-of-combined-covid-flu-vaccine"&gt;trials in Australia&lt;/a&gt;, as are &lt;a href="https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2024/2024-12-11-06-00-00-2995072"&gt;scientists elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;, of combined vaccines. One day these could allow vaccination against COVID and flu in a single shot – but these are still a way off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not sure about your eligibility or have any questions about either vaccine, discuss this with your GP, specialist of pharmacist. Australian &lt;a href="https://www.health.qld.gov.au/clinical-practice/guidelines-procedures/diseases-infection/immunisation/service-providers/2025-free-flu-vaccination-program"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/2025-influenza-flu-vaccination-consumer-fact-sheet?language=en"&gt;federal government&lt;/a&gt; websites also provide reliable information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

nofollow"&gt;Tiffer82&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sadly, such cases are far too common&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that over 53 million Americans are unpaid caregivers. On average, at-home care in the U.S. costs $61,000 per year, while a private room in a nursing facility is nearly double that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicole Jorwic, chief of advocacy and campaigns for Caring Across Generations, believes the situation is “beyond a crisis point.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s been a rolling crisis, and we’re at a catastrophic point,” she &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-hidden-costs-of-unpaid-caregiving-in-america/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; CBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jorwic advocates for government action to support family caregivers, who she notes provide $600 billion of unpaid care annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it can be so costly, some try to take on that task by themselves; however, according to Duke University School of Nursing (DUSON) Associate Professor Cristina Hendrix, DNS, GNP-BC, FNP, FAAN, whose research focuses on developing and implementing interventions to train and support family and friends of adults in home-based care, lost hours of paid work coupled with gaps in care, such as missing an important sign of worsening condition that might result in an emergency care visit, can lead to even higher costs overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span

&lt;p&gt;"We are deeply saddened to report that a school-aged child who was recently diagnosed with measles has passed away," Aaron Davis, vice president of UMC Health System, a medical center in Texas, told AFP news agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Davis added that the child, who had been receiving treatment for "complications of measles," did not have any underlying conditions and was not vaccinated against the highly &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/infectious-diseases/t-71255642"&gt;infectious disease.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February, a child died of measles in the first death from the illness in the US in over a decade. The outbreak began in late January in Gaines County, a remote area in western Texas where the vaccination rate is lower than the protective rate of 95%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March, an adult's death in the neighboring state of New Mexico was also classified as a measles-related death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="vjs-wrapper embed big"&gt;&lt;h2 aria-label="Embedded video — Trump wields budget ax against US science, medical research" class="headline"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;g fill-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;Trump wields budget ax against US science, medical research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;video id="video-71924042" controls playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-id="71924042" data-posterurl="https://static.dw.com/image/71865331_605.webp" data-duration="02:55"&gt;&lt;source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/dwtv_video/flv/je/je20250314_QScience12E_,AVC_480x270,AVC_512x288,AVC_640x360,AVC_960x540,AVC_1280x720,AVC_1920x1080,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;source src="https://tvdownloaddw-a.akamaihd.net/dwtv_video/flv/je/je20250314_QScience12E_AVC_1920x1080.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;p class="vjs-no-js"&gt;To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that &lt;a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank"&gt;supports HTML5 video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Kennedy calls for vaccinations &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/rfk-jrs-measles-cure-sickens-texas-kids-amid-outbreak/a-72149122"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; Jr , US President &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/donald-trump/t-19434433"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;'s health secretary, took to social media platform X on Sunday, saying "the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy is known for downplaying the importance of vaccines, which has alarmed healthcare experts across the nation. He has also described taking vaccines as a personal choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Davis from the Texas medical center said that the second measles death "underscores the importance of vaccination." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy said that 642 cases of measles have been confirmed in 22 states, with &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/measles-in-texas-a-deadly-disease-that-can-be-prevented/a-68121991"&gt;499 of them in Texas&lt;/a&gt; alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He made the comments during a trip to Texas to meet the families of the two children who died of the illness.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump, however, downplayed the outbreak when questioned by reporters onboard the Air Force One, saying it was "so far a fairly small number of people relative to what we're talking about." He promised "very strong action" would be taken if things worsened.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For some patients, the amount of blackened tissue that needs removing is so extreme it’s impossible and they die within days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Mucorales, the fungal family which causes Mucormycosis, is not one considered ‘critical’ by WHO ranking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are four invasive fungal pathogens deemed ‘critical’ on the list, and their insidious spores can even be found in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of them, “Candida albicans”, can be found “in about half the population inside our guts,” says Dr Rebecca Drummond, Associate Professor in antifungal immunity, University of Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspergillus, another critical priority pathogen, is in fact so widespread that most people inhale between 100 to 1000 spores every day from the air we breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the mould on bread can contain Mucor, a fungus that causes Mucormycosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The invasive fungal infection making lungs bleed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if these threats are so prevalent, why don’t we hear about them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists say it’s because those most at risk to fungal pathogens are people with weak immune systems, like patients living with HIV or on chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most fungal infections attack people who’ve already got existing illnesses, so they’ve either got weakened immune systems or they’ve got problems with their lungs” Prof Armstrong-James says. “Because they don’t strike down the man or woman in the street, so to speak, they don’t enter into the public folklore in the same way that viruses and bacteria do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As medical interventions have improved – think of advances in chemotherapy that have enabled a much greater number of cancers to be treated – there are now more people living with compromised immune systems who are vulnerable to deadly spores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grace*, 66, has long suffered from severe asthma. Just over 10 years ago, she was diagnosed with Chronic Pulmonary Aspergillosis (CPA) and Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis, a lung-damaging, life-threatening, condition caused by the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus – another of the WHO’s priority pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘I’d get my children to do back patting exercises to try and loosen [the mucus], I’d be on the floor over the cushions trying to be a bit upside down.’ Scans finally revealed the extent of the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of [the doctors] said: ‘We know it’s not cancer, because [with] the amount of patches you’ve got, you wouldn’t be here,” she said, referring to the dark blotches of lung damage visible by x-ray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cocktails of antifungal drugs made her hair fall out and damaged her liver function.&lt;/p&gt;
