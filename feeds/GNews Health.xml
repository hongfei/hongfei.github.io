          &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="21" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqmmxv002835778alv0k0u@published"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://slate.com/theslatest?utm_source=slate&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article_plain_text_topper"&gt;Sign up for the Slatest&lt;/a&gt; to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqkqe0000gsnksf7beuaol@published"&gt;For over a year, I walked around feeling like my head was underwater. Tasks blurred together; it took longer to think of words. I struggled to follow conversations, and as a result experienced social anxiety for the first time in my life. On bad days, even reading a single sentence required a painful level of focus. I started calling it “brain fog,” though the term felt frustratingly vague, more of a symptom than a diagnosis. Was it just my mental health? Burnout? I’d had COVID—was it from that?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlb3r000o3577r8gll6kl@published"&gt;I tried everything: sleep, stretching, meditation, medication. I got blood panels to make sure I was healthy. The doctors I saw looked at me with a shrug. The gist was: &lt;em&gt;We can run more tests if you want, but everything seems fine. It’s probably just anxiety. Try to relax.&lt;/em&gt; The fog always returned. I felt doomed.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlb8w000p3577qqm40e1y@published"&gt;Then I came across a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9845100/"&gt;small study&lt;/a&gt; in Bioelectronic Medicine, in which researchers gave nicotine patches, the same ones that smokers use to quit cigarettes, to four long-COVID patients for up to a week. Their cognitive symptoms—things like poor concentration and memory issues—improved dramatically, according to patient surveys. The study was tiny and far from conclusive, but I was desperate and willing to give anything a try.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="66" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlbe7000q3577yfk51wp7@published"&gt;The patch seemed like a big leap, though. At 7 milligrams of nicotine, it felt like too much for me. I’ve never smoked a cigarette or vaped in my life, so this would be my introduction to the substance. I was also worried about the nausea that some people experience with the patches. So I picked up the lowest-dose nicotine gum I could find: 2 milligrams.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="148" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlbkd000r3577qkeb2h0e@published"&gt;That afternoon, I chewed a piece, feeling a bit ridiculous. I was skeptical that this potential fix would be any different from everything else I’d tried (that is, a bust). But within an hour, something had clicked. The fog didn’t lift entirely, but my brain felt like it had come back online in a way it hadn’t in months. Now, I keep a pack of gum on my desk and another in my bag, just in case. Most mornings, I pop a piece while I’m answering emails or getting ready to write. I take another before social events. Two months in, I still chew one or two pieces a day, and the symptoms have mostly stayed away. Every few weeks I can feel a hint of brain fog creeping back in, but it’s nothing like before. My concentration has skyrocketed. I feel like I have my life back.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlbnh000s3577yo5szlmw@published"&gt;To be very clear: Anyone taking nicotine to treat brain fog (like me) is still very much experimenting. There are no protocols or prescribed doses approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The evidence for nicotine’s use in otherwise-healthy people with mild cognitive issues is limited to early studies and &lt;a href="https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/nicotine-patches-for-long-covid/?pg=2"&gt;anecdotal accounts across long-COVID forums&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that for some people, it might help. There is more research on how nicotine may help people with some cognitive disorders, though this, too, is something scientists are still exploring. Overall, it might be accurate to say that nicotine “holds promise” as a potential tool for brain functioning.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="138" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlbr8000t3577j7b168rl@published"&gt;Bear with me. You might be thinking, &lt;em&gt;Isn’t nicotine bad?&lt;/em&gt; The word carries decades of baggage, mostly thanks to Big Tobacco. And there’s no doubt cigarettes (and even vapes) are terrible for your health. But when divorced from cigarettes and delivered in controlled, slow-release doses, researchers say it can, in fact, be good. “We have found that nicotine patches are useful along a whole spectrum of impairments, like people with ADHD, Alzheimer’s, and people with age-related memory and cognitive impairment,” says &lt;a href="https://psychiatry.duke.edu/profile/edward-daniel-levin"&gt;Edward Levin&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University who studies the effects of nicotine. It has also been shown to help with &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu/today/2017/01/23/nicotine-normalizes-brain-deficits-key-schizophrenia"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4430096/"&gt;Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6129985/"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;. However, Levin emphasized that all those uses for nicotine patches—anything other than quitting smoking—are still under investigation. He hopes scientists will know more in the “near future.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="114" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlbvd000u35778d0i61ci@published"&gt;What we know now is that nicotine is a chemical compound that acts on receptors in the brain called nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, or nAChRs. “The word we use is &lt;em&gt;modulate&lt;/em&gt;—so they modulate nerve cell–to–nerve cell transmission throughout the brain,” says &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/ccm/person/paul-newhouse-md"&gt;Paul Newhouse&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychiatry and pharmacology and the director of the Vanderbilt Center for Cognitive Medicine at Vanderbilt University. ”They have an important role in all sorts of human behaviors and cognitive functions.” Those receptors usually respond to acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in everything from muscle activation to attention. But nicotine can bind to and activate those receptors in much the same way as acetylcholine, essentially mimicking its effects on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="159" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlbyb000v357769ym1vga@published"&gt;Nicotine’s role in facilitating attention is one of its most well-established functions. “We know that nicotine receptors are involved particularly in attention—so the ability to focus and maintain attention, all of that seems to have an important role for nicotinic signaling,” says Newhouse. “And attention is the front end of memory, right? So without attention, you can’t encode or remember anything.” That’s why it’s promising when it comes to conditions involving memory. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3466669/"&gt;In 2012&lt;/a&gt;, Newhouse and Levin published a randomized controlled trial showing that short-term nicotine use improved cognitive performance in people with mild cognitive impairment. They’re now wrapping up a larger, &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/alz.064697"&gt;multiyear follow-up study&lt;/a&gt; looking at the long-term effects of nicotine in this population, with results expected later this year.&lt;br&gt;While this kind of data could help build the case for therapeutic nicotine, doctors currently have no guidelines—and no FDA approval—to prescribe it for anything beyond smoking cessation, so many clinicians probably wouldn’t feel comfortable recommending it just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="151" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlc1a000w3577vncofv1j@published"&gt;The research on nicotine’s effects on long COVID is very new compared to other cognitive conditions, and there is yet to be a randomized controlled trial. But Marco Leitzke, who is a guest scientist at the Clinic and Polyclinic at the University of Leipzig in Germany and the researcher behind the initial nicotine and long-COVID study that I read, is optimistic about its potential. “Impaired nAChR function in the human body is the &lt;a href="https://bioelecmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42234-025-00167-8"&gt;first and only hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; that can logically explain and decipher every symptom of long COVID,” he says. Since publishing his findings, he’s continued researching dosing regimens and giving lectures to build awareness around the hypothesis that this is what’s happening with long COVID, and that nicotine can help. But to move from hypothesis to proven treatment, he says, the scientific community urgently needs double-blind, randomized, controlled trials—the gold standard for treatment research—on nicotine therapy for post-acute infection syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlc4z000x35770bpyq22l@published"&gt;Cigarettes and vapes are bad for your health because of what they do to your lungs, but that’s not the only difference between those vices and therapeutic nicotine. Compared to the near-instant delivery of a cigarette—where nicotine spikes in the brain within seconds—gum and patches release it far more gradually. “With the patch, it comes up to a plateau and stays there all day long,” says Levin. The gum—my delivery system of choice—is a little different, but it also doesn’t deliver the big hit that comes with puffing on a cigarette or a vaping device. “You have a very slow absorption, and it kind of comes to a peak, depending on how long you have it in your mouth, but it’ll gradually dissipate,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="136" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlc8j000y3577evrcjcu0@published"&gt;That slower absorption matters, not just for side effects, but for addiction risk. “Anything that you put in your body has a risk associated with it,” Levin says. “But I would say that the gum and the patches are at the very low end of the risk curve.” A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8183099/"&gt;2021 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; looked at 608 nonsmokers who were administered the patch and found that no one reported dependence. Still, nicotine isn’t side effect–free. The most common issues for nonsmokers include nausea, dizziness, or (in the case of patches) skin irritation. Many people who tried the patch to manage long-COVID symptoms have &lt;a href="https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/nicotine-patches-for-long-covid/?pg=4"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in forums that they’ve had to stop because it caused vomiting. And nicotine isn’t safe for everyone; Levin specifically warns against use during pregnancy, nursing, and in children due to potential effects on brain development.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlcav000z3577mba903pk@published"&gt;There’s another important caveat: More isn’t always better. Over Zoom, Newhouse shows me a U-shaped graph. On the x-axis: dose. On the y-axis: performance. “If you’re not working at the optimal level, then stimulating nicotinic receptors will bring you up to here or closer to here.” He points to the top of the curve, where performance is peaking. That’s the ideal case.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlcdx00103577x8zdbf5k@published"&gt;If your brain is already working well, though, nicotine can have the &lt;em&gt;opposite &lt;/em&gt;effect. “If you’re right here at the top of the curve, functioning at a high level, if I flog your nicotinic receptors, you’re actually going to have a decline in performance,” he adds. I’ve noticed this in my own nicotine use—on days when I used the gum while already feeling clearheaded, I sometimes felt jittery, not sharper. That was rare, but it reminded me that there is the potential to overdo it.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="146" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlch6001135774mg7uy5q@published"&gt;So: An article on the internet, like this one, cannot tell you that nicotine is a proven therapy for brain fog, or anything else. But if you do try it, Levin recommends going “low and slow,” and working with a doctor. Newhouse says he regularly fields questions from patients curious about trying nicotine for early Alzheimer’s concerns, though he doesn’t have data on how many physicians are actually discussing it with their patients. Both he and Levin are skeptical that nicotine will ever gain FDA approval for cognitive impairment. There’s simply no financial incentive—nicotine is too cheap, too old, and too unsexy for drug companies to invest in. “If it turns out to work for certain kinds of cognitive problems, then it’s a pretty cheap and easy-to-access treatment,” says Newhouse. “But it’s not without its side effects and risks, too. I mean, there’s no free lunch.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="43" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlcjq00123577xnghv6si@published"&gt;For me, the uncertainty around nicotine feels like a small price to pay. The gum’s been working, so I haven’t bothered switching to patches. (Why mess with a good thing?) After a year of fog, I’m just glad to feel like myself &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Beards have long attracted suspicion, sometimes seen as stylish, sometimes as unsanitary. But how dirty are they, really?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human skin is home to billions of microorganisms – mainly bacteria, but also fungi and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="164300" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; – and facial hair provides a unique environment for them to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro.2017.157"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that beards, in particular, support a dense and diverse microbial population, which has fuelled a persistent belief that they are inherently unhygienic. The Washington Post recently &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/05/14/beards-bacteria-toilets/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that some toilets contain fewer germs than the average beard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But are beards truly a hygiene risk? A closer look at the evidence reveals a nuanced picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The microbial population on skin varies by location and is influenced by factors such as temperature, pH, humidity and nutrient availability. Beards create a warm, often moist environment where food debris and oils can accumulate – ideal conditions for microbial growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These microbes thrive not just because of the warm, moist conditions beards provide, but also because of constant exposure to new contaminants and microbes, especially from hands that frequently touch surfaces and the face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns among scientists about beard hygiene date back over 50 years. Early &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC547091/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; showed that facial hair could retain bacteria and bacterial toxins even after washing. This led to the enduring idea that beards act as bacterial reservoirs and could pose an infection risk to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For healthcare workers, this has made beards a point of controversy, especially in hospitals where pathogen transmission is a concern. However, hospital-based research has shown mixed results. One &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9542990/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that bearded healthcare workers had higher bacterial loads on their faces than clean-shaven colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00330-018-5648-z"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt;, looking at whether it would be hygienic to evaluate dogs and humans in the same  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="164300" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; scanner, found that most men's beards contained significantly more microbes than dog fur, including a greater presence of harmful bacteria. The researchers concluded: "Dogs are no risk to humans if they use the same MRI."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164309" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164309" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/dog_in_mri_642.jpg" alt="dog in an mri" class="wp-image-164309 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/dog_in_mri_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/dog_in_mri_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/dog_in_mri_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164309" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Which is less hygienic, a dog or your beard? (Zinkevych/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, other studies have challenged the idea that beards increase infection risk. For example, one investigation found &lt;a href="https://www.journalofhospitalinfection.com/article/S0195-6701(14)00090-5/fulltext"&gt;no significant difference&lt;/a&gt; in bacterial colonisation between bearded and clean-shaven healthcare workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same study also reported that bearded doctors were less likely to carry &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt;, a major cause of hospital infections, and that there was no increase in infection rates among patients treated by bearded surgeons wearing surgical masks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beards can sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/skin/beard-burn"&gt;spread skin infections&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="https://medicinetoday.com.au/dermatology-quiz/vesiculopustular-eruption-beard"&gt;impetigo&lt;/a&gt; – a contagious rash often caused by &lt;em&gt;S. aureus,&lt;/em&gt; which is commonly found in facial hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In rare cases, parasites like pubic lice – which usually live in the groin area – can also &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0365059619301783"&gt;show up&lt;/a&gt; in beards, eyebrows or eyelashes, particularly in cases of poor hygiene or close contact with an infected person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The case for good beard hygiene&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neglected beards can foster irritation, inflammation and infection. The skin beneath a beard – rich in blood vessels, nerve endings and immune cells – is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27212465/"&gt;highly sensitive&lt;/a&gt; to microbial and environmental stressors. When sebum, dead skin, food debris and pollutants accumulate, they can irritate the skin and provide fuel for &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/problems-caused-by-beards"&gt;fungal and bacterial growth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC547091/"&gt;strongly recommend&lt;/a&gt; washing your beard and face every day. Doing so removes dirt, oils, allergens and dead skin, helping prevent microbial buildup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164310" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164310" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/beard_trim_642.jpg" alt="man getting his beard trimmed" class="wp-image-164310 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/beard_trim_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/beard_trim_642-600x388.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164310" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A well-trimmed, washed beard is no bacterial utopia.

These steps help maintain not only hygiene but also beard health and appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, are beards dirty? Like most things, it depends on how well you care for them. With daily hygiene and proper grooming, beards pose little risk and may even be healthier than we once thought.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256917/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

That’s not entirely surprising. Dietitians say that many people don’t know about the health benefits of eating seafood, or they may have concerns about the environmental impact and sustainability of commercial fishing. Some may be worried about exposure to mercury, a neurotoxin that’s found throughout the ocean and that can accumulate in fish.

But it does have some disadvantages. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666154320300375" target="_blank"&gt;Studies have found&lt;/a&gt; that the amount of omega-3s and mercury in farmed salmon &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25198598/" target="_blank"&gt;can vary widely&lt;/a&gt;, in part because it depends on what the fish were fed. Some types of farmed salmon are also farmed in ways that can be &lt;a href="https://www.seafoodwatch.org/recommendations/download-consumer-guides/national-consumer-guide" target="_blank"&gt;detrimental to the environment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GDT5544G4RCEVE5LU44OW6KPYI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While farmed salmon can certainly be a good choice, wild salmon is almost always the better option. “Wild salmon is a triple win because it’s high in good fats, low in mercury and sustainable,” said Sonya Lunder, the director of community science at the Natural Resources Defense Council and the author of a &lt;a href="https://static.ewg.org/reports/2016/mercury-in-seafood/EWG_MercuryinSeafood.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;report on seafood consumption&lt;/a&gt; and mercury exposure for&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the Environmental Working Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AV3G4UXJZBFUJIHDEFSVTNYVMM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For affordable options, look for &lt;a href="https://wildplanetfoods.com/products/wild-sockeye-salmon" target="_blank"&gt;canned wild salmon&lt;/a&gt; and frozen &lt;a href="https://www.target.com/p/alaska-salmon-burgers-frozen-16oz-4ct-good-38-gather-8482/-/A-82032192?gQT=1" target="_blank"&gt;wild salmon burgers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/product/365-by-whole-foods-market-sockeye-salmon-fillet-32-oz-b07nrcrzff" target="_blank"&gt;fillets&lt;/a&gt; in the freezer section of your grocery store. Then try them out in quick and delicious recipes such as &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/recipes/creamy-salmon-pasta/" target="_blank"&gt;Creamy Salmon Pasta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/recipes/quick-lentil-salmon-salad/" target="_blank"&gt;Lentil Salmon Salad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="KDY45QFUB5FRHLNZYJCCGQDXMI" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="KDY45QFUB5FRHLNZYJCCGQDXMI" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Sardines, anchovies and Atlantic mackerel&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5X25LBG2ZZG7XNYESDGAP6USLM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;These small fish are a good choice for several reasons. Because they’re low on the food chain, they’re relatively low in mercury and other toxins (large predatory fish at the top of the food chain accumulate more contaminants). They’re high in protein and omega-3 fats. And they tend to be sustainable because they reproduce more rapidly than larger fish species, said Zeratsky at the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="6XBCRAWIHBEHHIYGQH2UX22JDQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="6XBCRAWIHBEHHIYGQH2UX22JDQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Rainbow trout&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LEJYN3Y2MZH2BPB3MY7K6YKONA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A single serving of rainbow trout contains more than an entire day’s worth of vitamin D and vitamin B12, as well as large amounts of omega-3 fats, protein and minerals. It has a mild flavor that makes it easy to use in a variety of dishes. It’s also a good choice for &lt;a href="https://www.seafoodwatch.org/seafood-basics/sustainable-healthy-fish/nutritious-rainbow-trout" target="_blank"&gt;environmental reasons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3NRH5EHAPNAWHC52UWPGPCOVF4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And it’s relatively affordable. Just look for tinned rainbow trout and frozen rainbow trout fillets at your grocery store. One type of rainbow trout called steelhead actually looks and tastes a lot like salmon (and it usually costs less, too). If you’ve never cooked trout before, don’t be intimidated. Consider trying this simple recipe for &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/recipes/baked-lemon-trout-caper-salsa/" target="_blank"&gt;Baked Lemon Trout with Caper Salsa&lt;/a&gt;, or this one for &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/recipes/pecan-crusted-trout-brown-butter-herb-sauce/" target="_blank"&gt;Pecan-crusted Trout with Brown Butter Herb Sauce&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="MICWIFS2VVDD5FEFW2ETKZD7X4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="MICWIFS2VVDD5FEFW2ETKZD7X4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Mussels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WSOFQLAMGBFIFF75RWG3S4LXP4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Mussels are one of the unsung heroes of the seafood world. They’re packed with protein, omega-3 fats, iron, zinc and vitamin B12. They’re very low in mercury. You can usually buy them for between $5 and $10 a pound. And most of the mussels sold in stores and restaurants are farm-raised, which is environmentally sustainable. Mussels can also be &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2020/10/29/mussels-recipe-with-three-sauces/" target="_blank"&gt;surprisingly easy&lt;/a&gt; to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="TS7W4R6ECBHWBL5SUBMCDSMOVA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="TS7W4R6ECBHWBL5SUBMCDSMOVA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Oysters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FY3GS5ZEIBGB5HVSZRSZOGZSZ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Oysters are chock full of omega-3 fats, vitamins and minerals, and they’re very low in mercury. Most oysters consumed in the United States are farm-raised and cultivated in a way that &lt;a href="https://www.seafoodwatch.org/seafood-basics/sustainable-healthy-fish/oysters" target="_blank"&gt;benefits the environment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KD5LEWINKVHQHFHJY7PCS3KK7U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Raw oysters can carry potentially harmful bacteria.

These types of seafood are still nutritious and good sources of protein.

Skipjack and other types of light tuna generally have less mercury than albacore. But the mercury content of light tuna can vary wildly. In 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/food-safety/how-worried-should-you-be-about-mercury-in-your-tuna-a5041903086/" target="_blank"&gt;Consumer Reports analyzed mercury levels&lt;/a&gt; in many brands of canned tuna purchased at grocery stores and found that albacore tuna had on average three times as much mercury as canned light tuna.

Other adults should consume no more than three servings of canned light tuna per week (about 12 ounces), or at most one serving of albacore tuna per week (four ounces).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="S32RI6PSYFFC7EUI4HUC5HNY2I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Children should avoid albacore tuna and stick to canned light tuna, but they should have no more than about two servings per week.

As more adults cross the half-century mark, that gradual loss of mental sharpness looms large, reshaping conversations about healthy aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent work following thousands of older Europeans now argues that one everyday choice casts a bigger shadow over &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/air-pollution-weakens-brain-function-and-focus-in-daily-tasks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain function&lt;/a&gt; and cognitive decline than most people realize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research team led by University College London (&lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCL&lt;/a&gt;) analyzed lifestyle data from 32,000 adults in 14 European countries who were at least 50 years old and showed no signs of dementia when tracking began. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across as many as 15 years, participants completed memory and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9999359/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;verbal-fluency tests&lt;/a&gt;, providing one of the most detailed portraits yet of how thinking skills change in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-behaviors-linked-to-cognitive-decline"&gt;Behaviors linked to cognitive decline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators assembled sixteen lifestyle “packages” from four common habits: smoking, moderate or vigorous exercise at least once a week, weekly social contact with friends or family, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/is-marijuana-really-safer-than-alcohol-science-weighs-in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;daily alcohol intake&lt;/a&gt; capped at two drinks for men or one for women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They compared every package with a reference pattern that included all four healthy behaviors. By separating the habits instead of folding them into a single &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01254-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;wellness score&lt;/a&gt;, the team could see which ones truly moved the needle on brain performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Smoking may be among the most important lifestyle factors affecting how quickly our cognitive skills decline as we age,” suggests a new study led by UCL researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That headline finding emerged once the data were crunched: participants who smoked experienced the steepest drops in test scores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their memory and word-finding abilities fell up to 85 percent more over ten years than scores among non-smokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smoking-s-outsized-impact"&gt;Smoking’s outsized impact&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study is observational, so cannot definitively establish cause and effect, but it suggests smoking might be a particularly important factor influencing the&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/does-vaping-help-people-quit-smoking-cigarettes-new-study-breaks-it-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; rate of cognitive ageing&lt;/a&gt;,” lead author Dr. Mikaela Bloomberg explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She noted that earlier studies linked clusters of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/forming-healthy-habits-takes-much-longer-than-21-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthy habits&lt;/a&gt; to slower decline, yet those studies rarely teased apart which behaviors mattered most. By isolating each habit, the new analysis revealed that lighting up stood apart from the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, when cigarettes dropped out of the picture, the remaining lifestyle combinations produced very similar cognitive trajectories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether participants exercised a little less, enjoyed an extra drink, or skipped a weekly gathering, their brains aged at nearly the same pace as those following the reference lifestyle – as long as they did not smoke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previous evidence suggests that individuals who engage in healthier behaviors experience slower cognitive decline; however, it was unclear whether all behaviors contribute equally to cognitive decline or whether specific behaviors drive these results,” Dr. Bloomberg added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smoking-biology-and-cognition"&gt;Smoking, biology, and cognition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cigarette smoke&lt;/a&gt; exposes tiny cerebral blood vessels to a mix of toxins that stiffen vessel walls and limit oxygen flow. The same chemicals spark chronic inflammation, leaving neurons vulnerable to damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over years, those insults can accelerate the shrinkage of key brain regions linked to memory and language. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise, moderate drinking, and social engagement can bolster overall health, but they struggle to counter the direct harm tobacco inflicts on neural tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the study offered a glimmer of good news for current smokers who embrace other healthy habits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that among the healthy behaviors we examined, not smoking may be among the most important in terms of maintaining cognitive function,” Dr Bloomberg said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For people who aren’t able to stop smoking, our results suggest that engaging in other healthy behaviors such as &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/metamorphosis-exercise-triggers-molecular-changes-in-major-organs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;regular exercise&lt;/a&gt;, moderate alcohol consumption and being socially active may help offset adverse cognitive effects associated with smoking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cognitive-decline-and-global-health"&gt;Cognitive decline and global health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, about one in five adults continues to smoke, and the habit remains more common in lower-income regions where dementia care is often scarce. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because memory loss erodes independence, quitting earlier in life can spare families emotional strain and reduce medical costs tied to long-term care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new analysis strengthens the case for investing in cessation services – nicotine-replacement therapy, counseling, and prescription aids – before cognitive slips gain momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers accounted for age, gender, education, wealth, chronic illnesses, and country of residence, confirming that smoking’s influence held steady even after those factors were considered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By following participants over such a long span, the team also captured changes that shorter studies might miss, reinforcing confidence in the pattern they observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-now-that-you-know-what-will-you-do"&gt;Now that you know, what will you do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skipping cigarettes emerges as the clearest step toward safeguarding late-life thinking, yet the study suggests that pairing a smoke-free routine with modest weekly movement, sensible drinking limits, and regular social contact yields an even sturdier foundation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brisk walk through the neighborhood, a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/morning-coffee-drinkers-have-a-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cup of coffee&lt;/a&gt; with a friend, and a single evening drink offer manageable ways to keep neurons working smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive decline rarely arrives overnight, but its grip tightens with each passing year. This large-scale European study highlights how one habit – smoking – quickens the slide more than any other measured behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armed with that insight, adults can stack the odds in their favor: stub out the cigarette, stay active, connect with others, and enjoy alcohol in moderation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small choices made today shape the clarity of tomorrow’s thoughts, giving every reader a practical path toward a sharper, more confident future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49262-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 11:36:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxQUGo1SFRUMnR1R2p2ek01eS05cnlVc0tvQmljSTJsdmJpWFJFZGNibTBlOS1HaDY1UVRMVUU5YUdxb0lZeTI0QUJ3YmxYN3lCakdnYTZyOTBpZlZEMU9Lc0R3RmJCQ0RHSWd4bWktR1VRaGZReUs4N2N1UVJhS3F3cFZIbU9GUUhGOFFCOGFkNlllUUk5SFNWM1FwM0Z0TzJ4Z0s1MjVqb2NiTWVMd3M3MFV5TQ</guid></item><item><title>专注于女性健康的医生分享了他们永远不会做的9件事- HuffPost | Doctors Who Specialize In Women's Health Share The 9 Things They Would Never, Ever Do - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxQOG9talVOcjRCaG1kUzhXSEVud2x5MXhnYTA0UVFVSmNKR2x6RFFJVFY4cl9IeXZabkcxNmM4QmE3NTd2VnpYWFEtaDJ3Q1h3WFpKMDZ1ZHo2QmNMU1BQbDBzVW9NWHlTSkZJeVBrVVJFR1pWWW5NeUhWWmx5b0c0OC1QTDVVRXBaOGpGdkZmVXRlMVRIRGc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between periods, menopause, perimenopause and pregnancy, being a woman can be &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; on the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;More, women’s health just isn’t as studied as men’s health.

Here’s what they’d never do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Discount the importance of movement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m moving all day long. And I think if everyone can make it a habit to just keep moving, our general health would be better in so many ways,” said &lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/doctors/1023498490/priya-m-freaney-md" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Priya Freaney" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nm.org/doctors/1023498490/priya-m-freaney-md" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Dr. Priya Freaney&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist and women’s heart health specialist at Northwestern Medicine in Illinois. Freaney added that she stretches every day at a minimum to prep her body for a day of rushing around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I run a postpartum hypertension clinic where I see new moms who have had blood pressure or other heart problems during pregnancy, and I tell people that as new moms, you have to be kind of creative in where you get your movement because there’s not a lot of time and there’s a lot of other responsibility,” Freaney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to fold in movement whenever you can is key, whether that’s taking the stairs, going on stroller walks or walking instead of driving to your errands, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Certainly compared to generations previous to us, we have more of an emphasis on exercise. Most people have sitting jobs, we spend most of our day sedentary, and we know that the biggest killer of women is heart disease, so as we get older, it becomes more and more important to protect our hearts, keep those arteries clear by doing things like exercising,” added &lt;a href="https://familydoctor.org/media_ambassadors/brintha-vasagar/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Brintha Vasagar" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://familydoctor.org/media_ambassadors/brintha-vasagar/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. Brintha Vasagar&lt;/a&gt;, a family physician in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise can &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="also lessen" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;also lessen&lt;/a&gt; feelings of anxiety and depression, help you sleep better and lowers the risk of certain cancers, &lt;a href="https://www.breastcancer.org/managing-life/exercise" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="including breast cancer" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.breastcancer.org/managing-life/exercise" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;including breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Skip out on nutrition. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three experts told HuffPost that healthy eating is one of the pillars they stick to for their current health and future health. This means fresh foods and less meat for &lt;a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/obgyn/team/777/clara-paik---gynecology---obstetrics-and-gynecology-sacramento/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Clara Paik" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://health.ucdavis.edu/obgyn/team/777/clara-paik---gynecology---obstetrics-and-gynecology-sacramento/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Dr. Clara Paik&lt;/a&gt;, the co-chief of the division of general obstetrics and gynecology at UC Davis Health in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vasagar described diet as well-being 101 and said she limits processed foods and focuses on lean meats, fresh fruits and veggies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freaney said she follows an 80-20 rule, where 80% of the time she eats nutritious foods and the other 20% of the time she chooses foods that may not have a big nutritional benefit but are celebratory or joy-inducing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freaney also tries to limit bready sweets, overall, because of their high levels of cholesterol and saturated fats. She also cooks at home often and makes extra so she has easy, healthy meals throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Ignore their numbers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Vasagar and Freaney said it’s important that you know your numbers — meaning, the factors that are generally checked through routine wellness and blood tests such as your blood pressure, blood sugar levels and cholesterol, in addition to your weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people wait until they have a problem to get their numbers checked, but that isn’t the way to live a long, healthy life, noted Vasagar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s those prevention strategies — knowing what your blood pressure is, knowing what your ideal weight should be for your body size, knowing what your sugars are and if you’re at risk for diabetes — catching those things early,” Vasagar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/risk-factors/index.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Having high blood pressure and high cholesterol" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/risk-factors/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Having high blood pressure and high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; can put you at heightened risk of developing heart disease, but, lifestyle changes like diet and exercise can help get these numbers in a healthy range, and medication can help, too, noted Vasagar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s why it’s so important to know your numbers early, so you can do something about it, attack it and keep your health as optimal as possible for as long as possible,” Vasagar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Disregard their heart disease risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, heart disease is the No. 1 killer of women in the United States — a fact that many people don’t realize, said Freaney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sixty million women in the United States have some form of heart disease and 80% of that is preventable to some degree,” Freaney noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The common forms of heart diseases that can affect and ultimately kill women start early in life and accumulate silently in the body without us realizing it ... before they come to clinical significance, before we feel something that leads our doctors to discover it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earlier you can understand and address your heart disease risk factors (things like diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure) the better, Freaney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, one piece of advice is that it is never too early for a woman to seek advice about their heart health,” she noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Grace Cary via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Grace Cary via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;It's important that you know your health numbers, including blood pressure, so you can keep them in control and make changes to stay healthy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Purchase scented creams and washes for their genitals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I really tell people, and I myself, never douche or put something to cleanse your vagina,” Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re basically getting rid of the normal flora that’s supposed to be there,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flora is necessary for maintaining a healthy pH balance, maintaining a barrier against bacteria and fungal infections and more. So, disrupting it can cause problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Women are extremely, almost too, hygienic in that area because they want to smell nice, and that’s a particular area of concern,” Paik noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While lots of brands market lotions and soaps for the genital region, they aren’t necessary or even safe. “Just normal showering and washing with water is all you need to do in that area. You do not need to use soaps, perfumes, bath bombs, douching. I avoid any of that,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Skip prenatal vitamins when pregnant and trying to get pregnant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For pregnant women, I always tell them to take prenatal vitamins,” Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The folic acid in the prenatal vitamins is not the same as in multivitamins, it has an extra dose of folic acid, which is important for preventing spinal cord abnormalities in the baby,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are trying to get pregnant should also take prenatal vitamins, Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Ignore the impact that pregnancy complications can have on your heart health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Freaney, pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes can put you at higher risk of heart disease later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3034989/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Research shows" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3034989/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that people who had preeclampsia are at higher risk of stroke and&lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/diabetes-during-pregnancy-may-increase-risk-of-heart-disease" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" those who had" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/diabetes-during-pregnancy-may-increase-risk-of-heart-disease" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt; those who had&lt;/a&gt; gestational diabetes are more likely to have heart artery calcification. This is true even if your blood sugar levels and other heart health markers go back to normal after pregnancy, Freaney noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Individuals who have had pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia or gestational diabetes should have a proactive discussion with their doctors about how they can reduce their risk of heart disease,” Freaney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Suffer in silence during perimenopause and menopause.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Menopause is a big topic these days ... every woman is so different in terms of how they view and feel during menopause,” Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some folks have hot flashes and night sweats for a few months while others are plagued with tough symptoms for years and years, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter how menopause impacts you, it isn’t a time to throw your hands up and say “oh well” or think you have to silently push through the discomfort. “I, myself, just realized, ‘Wow, this is the latter half of my life, I have one life to live. I better take good care of myself,’” Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I really kicked into the nutrition and exercise and just trying to keep myself healthy, rather than dealing with illness once it happens,” she noted. And going on hormone treatment is also a good option for many women, Paik added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know that estrogen has been a really hot topic, and that also is one of those things where our medical opinions on hormone replacement and the benefits and risks of estrogen have changed over time as we’ve gotten more information,” Vasagar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a while, women strayed away from hormone treatments because of fears of breast cancer risk, Vasagar noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now, I think we’re starting to get back into how can we use hormones to benefit women, protecting their heart health, protecting from osteoporosis, while also mitigating any risk that each individual has towards breast cancer and some other things that estrogen can contribute to,” Vasagar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9.

We lose our natural estrogen levels, and with the loss of natural estrogen, our whole cardiometabolic profile shifts for the worst,” Freaney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I try to counsel my female patients that the years around menopause are really a time of accelerating cardiovascular risk, and we need to go into that decade of life in the most optimal cardiovascular health to brace ourselves for this transition that is going to inevitably come to every woman,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around menopause, your blood pressure increases, your LDL cholesterol (also known as the bad cholesterol) goes up and your HDL cholesterol (your good cholesterol) goes down, according to Freaney. Your fat mass goes up while your muscle mass goes down, she added. Your sleep and mood worsens, too, which can have downstream effects on exercise and nutrition — because who wants to go for a bike ride after a night of bad sleep?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

Here’s what they’d never do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Discount the importance of movement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m moving all day long. And I think if everyone can make it a habit to just keep moving, our general health would be better in so many ways,” said &lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/doctors/1023498490/priya-m-freaney-md" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Priya Freaney" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nm.org/doctors/1023498490/priya-m-freaney-md" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Dr. Priya Freaney&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist and women’s heart health specialist at Northwestern Medicine in Illinois. Freaney added that she stretches every day at a minimum to prep her body for a day of rushing around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I run a postpartum hypertension clinic where I see new moms who have had blood pressure or other heart problems during pregnancy, and I tell people that as new moms, you have to be kind of creative in where you get your movement because there’s not a lot of time and there’s a lot of other responsibility,” Freaney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to fold in movement whenever you can is key, whether that’s taking the stairs, going on stroller walks or walking instead of driving to your errands, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Certainly compared to generations previous to us, we have more of an emphasis on exercise. Most people have sitting jobs, we spend most of our day sedentary, and we know that the biggest killer of women is heart disease, so as we get older, it becomes more and more important to protect our hearts, keep those arteries clear by doing things like exercising,” added &lt;a href="https://familydoctor.org/media_ambassadors/brintha-vasagar/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Brintha Vasagar" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://familydoctor.org/media_ambassadors/brintha-vasagar/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. Brintha Vasagar&lt;/a&gt;, a family physician in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise can &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="also lessen" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;also lessen&lt;/a&gt; feelings of anxiety and depression, help you sleep better and lowers the risk of certain cancers, &lt;a href="https://www.breastcancer.org/managing-life/exercise" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="including breast cancer" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.breastcancer.org/managing-life/exercise" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;including breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Skip out on nutrition. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three experts told HuffPost that healthy eating is one of the pillars they stick to for their current health and future health.

She also cooks at home often and makes extra so she has easy, healthy meals throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Ignore their numbers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Vasagar and Freaney said it’s important that you know your numbers — meaning, the factors that are generally checked through routine wellness and blood tests such as your blood pressure, blood sugar levels and cholesterol, in addition to your weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people wait until they have a problem to get their numbers checked, but that isn’t the way to live a long, healthy life, noted Vasagar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s those prevention strategies — knowing what your blood pressure is, knowing what your ideal weight should be for your body size, knowing what your sugars are and if you’re at risk for diabetes — catching those things early,” Vasagar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/risk-factors/index.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Having high blood pressure and high cholesterol" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/risk-factors/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Having high blood pressure and high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; can put you at heightened risk of developing heart disease, but, lifestyle changes like diet and exercise can help get these numbers in a healthy range, and medication can help, too, noted Vasagar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s why it’s so important to know your numbers early, so you can do something about it, attack it and keep your health as optimal as possible for as long as possible,” Vasagar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Disregard their heart disease risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, heart disease is the No. 1 killer of women in the United States — a fact that many people don’t realize, said Freaney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sixty million women in the United States have some form of heart disease and 80% of that is preventable to some degree,” Freaney noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The common forms of heart diseases that can affect and ultimately kill women start early in life and accumulate silently in the body without us realizing it ... before they come to clinical significance, before we feel something that leads our doctors to discover it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earlier you can understand and address your heart disease risk factors (things like diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure) the better, Freaney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, one piece of advice is that it is never too early for a woman to seek advice about their heart health,” she noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Grace Cary via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Grace Cary via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;It's important that you know your health numbers, including blood pressure, so you can keep them in control and make changes to stay healthy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Purchase scented creams and washes for their genitals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I really tell people, and I myself, never douche or put something to cleanse your vagina,” Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re basically getting rid of the normal flora that’s supposed to be there,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flora is necessary for maintaining a healthy pH balance, maintaining a barrier against bacteria and fungal infections and more. So, disrupting it can cause problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Women are extremely, almost too, hygienic in that area because they want to smell nice, and that’s a particular area of concern,” Paik noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While lots of brands market lotions and soaps for the genital region, they aren’t necessary or even safe. “Just normal showering and washing with water is all you need to do in that area. You do not need to use soaps, perfumes, bath bombs, douching. I avoid any of that,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Skip prenatal vitamins when pregnant and trying to get pregnant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For pregnant women, I always tell them to take prenatal vitamins,” Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The folic acid in the prenatal vitamins is not the same as in multivitamins, it has an extra dose of folic acid, which is important for preventing spinal cord abnormalities in the baby,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are trying to get pregnant should also take prenatal vitamins, Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Ignore the impact that pregnancy complications can have on your heart health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Freaney, pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes can put you at higher risk of heart disease later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3034989/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Research shows" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3034989/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that people who had preeclampsia are at higher risk of stroke and&lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/diabetes-during-pregnancy-may-increase-risk-of-heart-disease" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" those who had" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/diabetes-during-pregnancy-may-increase-risk-of-heart-disease" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt; those who had&lt;/a&gt; gestational diabetes are more likely to have heart artery calcification. This is true even if your blood sugar levels and other heart health markers go back to normal after pregnancy, Freaney noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Individuals who have had pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia or gestational diabetes should have a proactive discussion with their doctors about how they can reduce their risk of heart disease,” Freaney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Suffer in silence during perimenopause and menopause.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Menopause is a big topic these days ... every woman is so different in terms of how they view and feel during menopause,” Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some folks have hot flashes and night sweats for a few months while others are plagued with tough symptoms for years and years, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter how menopause impacts you, it isn’t a time to throw your hands up and say “oh well” or think you have to silently push through the discomfort. “I, myself, just realized, ‘Wow, this is the latter half of my life, I have one life to live. I better take good care of myself,’” Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I really kicked into the nutrition and exercise and just trying to keep myself healthy, rather than dealing with illness once it happens,” she noted. And going on hormone treatment is also a good option for many women, Paik added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know that estrogen has been a really hot topic, and that also is one of those things where our medical opinions on hormone replacement and the benefits and risks of estrogen have changed over time as we’ve gotten more information,” Vasagar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a while, women strayed away from hormone treatments because of fears of breast cancer risk, Vasagar noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now, I think we’re starting to get back into how can we use hormones to benefit women, protecting their heart health, protecting from osteoporosis, while also mitigating any risk that each individual has towards breast cancer and some other things that estrogen can contribute to,” Vasagar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Ignore the impact menopause has on cardiovascular health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only does &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/menopause" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="menopause" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/topic/menopause" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt; bring hot flashes, mood changes and bone density loss, it also brings negative changes to heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a big shift that happens there. We lose our natural estrogen levels, and with the loss of natural estrogen, our whole cardiometabolic profile shifts for the worst,” Freaney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I try to counsel my female patients that the years around menopause are really a time of accelerating cardiovascular risk, and we need to go into that decade of life in the most optimal cardiovascular health to brace ourselves for this transition that is going to inevitably come to every woman,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around menopause, your blood pressure increases, your LDL cholesterol (also known as the bad cholesterol) goes up and your HDL cholesterol (your good cholesterol) goes down, according to Freaney. Your fat mass goes up while your muscle mass goes down, she added. Your sleep and mood worsens, too, which can have downstream effects on exercise and nutrition — because who wants to go for a bike ride after a night of bad sleep?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

								&lt;p&gt;Post-pandemic amnesia is a natural reaction, and it’s common for misremembering to occur after a pandemic or collective traumatic event occurs. Yet the reality is that SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/covid-19" target="_blank"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, is still finding ways to infect people by evolving new mutations, and a new variant has raised concern among virologists that continue to track the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;labeled&lt;/a&gt; the COVID variant NB.1.8.1 a “variant under monitoring” because it has been surging across Asia and made up 10.7% of global sequences reported as of mid-May. Now, the variant has been detected in the United States, Europe and Canada as well, concerning virus trackers who — for the first time since the &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2023/08/20/a-new-variant-nicknamed-pirola-is-raising-global-alarm-but-dont-freak-out-yet/" target="_blank"&gt;Pirola variant began circulating in August 2023&lt;/a&gt; — bestowed upon it a nickname: Nimbus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nimbus has recombined genetic material from other strains three times. Although the process of &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/11/14/recombinant-strains-explainer/" target="_blank"&gt;recombination is a natural process&lt;/a&gt; of viruses trying to evolve to survive among the population, recombination events are concerning because each time a virus does so, it has the potential to evolve into something that is more infectious or causes more severe disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these mutations in Nimbus allows it to evade the immunity we have built against the virus from prior infections, so transmissibility might be slightly higher, said Dr. Rajendram Rajnarayanan, of the New York Institute of Technology campus in Jonesboro, Arkansas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.30.651462v1"&gt;preprint study&lt;/a&gt;, not yet peer-reviewed, found that the way this variant binds to cells could make it infect them more efficiently than earlier strains and that it could be easier for this strain to be passed along to someone else. However, there has not been any evidence yet to suggest that Nimbus is linked to more severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nimbus "is a strong candidate for the summer surge."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We haven’t seen a big surge in emergency departments due to COVID-related conditions and respiratory things in this term yet,” Rajnarayanan told Salon in a video call. “We have to wait and watch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, many people have been reporting a symptom called “razor blade throat,” but it’s unclear if this is a symptom of COVID or one of the many other viruses circulating. Overall, it is difficult to attribute certain symptoms to variants when there are more than a dozen circulating at a time and testing remains relatively low compared to earlier stages of the pandemic, said Dr. T. Ryan Gregory, an evolutionary and genome biologist at the University of Guelph in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That said, we learned from &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2023/05/02/as-mutates-the-vaccine-goalpost-has-shifted-to-preventing-severe-illness-and/" target="_blank"&gt;Omicron&lt;/a&gt; that high transmissibility can cause as much damage as high per infection virulence, and at this point it is not just acute severity that is of concern, but longer-term impacts of repeated infection,” Gregory told Salon in an email. Such impacts include conditions like "&lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2023/08/13/long-is-devastating-and-far-from-rare-as-infections-rise-again-why-are-we-still-ignoring-it/" target="_blank"&gt;long COVID&lt;/a&gt;," in which the symptoms of COVID last for months or years, often disabling patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, current data shows that most COVID infections in the U.S. are &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions"&gt;currently caused by the LP.8.1 variant&lt;/a&gt;, which descends from Pirola. Both of these strains are technically still in the WHO’s Greek letter “Omicron” family, which now contains thousands of offspring. If there's one thing viruses are good at, it's mutating into new forms that can evade our immunity, whether that's from vaccines or past infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the WHO decided to &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/updated-working-definitions-and-primary-actions-for--sars-cov-2-variants" target="_blank"&gt;only name variants with this system if they were considered a “variant of concern”&lt;/a&gt; and stated that certain action steps should be taken by countries if a variant fell under this classification. However, the agency has not labeled any variants like this since Omicron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/covid-variant-namer-gregory-6e8e9d3d"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt; that some variants have been different enough to warrant a new name, and that not naming variants makes it more difficult to distinguish between the complex alphabet soup of variants that are circulating at any given time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Pirola, which included the BA.2.86 variant along with its descendants, was about as genetically different from the original Omicron strain as Omicron was from the original “wild strain” virus from Wuhan, China. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in the past two years, “it’s largely been the Pirola show,” Gregory said. Current vaccines have been designed to protect against this strain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, Nimbus is not very common in the U.S., but it has been identified in California and has enough mutations in its spike protein that it has a potential to cause waves of illness in other regions — which is in part why it was designated a name. At-home tests should still work to detect this variant, but PCR tests that doctors can order are more accurate. Masking also helps prevent the spread of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year following the start of the COVID pandemic, cases have surged in the summer. Last year's summer surge hit around August and was so intense that &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/08/22/is-getting-so-bad-new-vaccines-were-given-early-approval/" target="_blank"&gt;vaccines were approved slightly early&lt;/a&gt;. Although this year's summer wave hasn't yet started, experts predict we will likely experience another wave this summer. As it stands, variant trackers expect either Nimbus or another variant called XFG to be the dominant strain this time around. Although XFG currently makes up a greater proportion of cases in North America than NB.1.8.1, the latter has been &lt;a href="https://www.syracuse.com/coronavirus/2025/06/new-covid-variant-in-ny-what-to-know-about-symptoms-cases-vaccines.html" target="_blank"&gt;detected in New York&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-05-30/a-new-covid-subvariant-spreads-rapidly-as-trump-pivots-away-from-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“NB.1.8.1 is a strong candidate for the summer surge,” Rajnarayanan said. “Yet what we know from previous instances is that it doesn't have to be a single variant that pushes up [to prominence] and sometimes it can be a group of variants … that pick up mutations from each other and recombine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that Nimbus is still similar enough to the Pirola variants that the available vaccines were designed to target. That means they should still be effective, Gregory said. However, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-picks-new-strain-fall-covid-vaccines-means-shot-rcna208726"&gt;concerns have been raised&lt;/a&gt; that vaccine access may be limited this fall due to the Food and Drug Administration announcing it would require drugmakers to conduct a new set of clinical trials before approving new vaccines for use. Last month, the FDA also said it will &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/fda-significantly-limits-covid-19-vaccine-recommendations" target="_blank"&gt;only recommend&lt;/a&gt; COVID vaccines for adults 65 and older and those at risk for severe illness. Critics have said this will only make the vaccines &lt;a href="https://abc7.com/post/covid-19-vaccine-what-know-new-trump-policy-limits/16488196/" target="_blank"&gt;less likely to be covered by insurance&lt;/a&gt; and less available overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy announced he was &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/rfk-jr-hhs-moves-to-restore-public-trust-in-vaccines-45495112"&gt;firing the expert panel&lt;/a&gt; that advises the Centers for Disease Control responsible for making recommendations on vaccines, further complicating matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paired with updated guidelines from the CDC that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/27/nx-s1-5413179/covid-vaccine-children-pregnant-rfk-cdc"&gt;drop recommendations for healthy pregnant women and kids&lt;/a&gt; to routinely get vaccinated, these changes from the federal government could have a chilling effect that leads fewer people to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m concerned about accessibility,” Rajnarayanan said, adding that it’s not clear if vaccines will be available to people without insurance that aren’t included in federal recommendations. “These kinds of things are still murky and I really want to see clearer guidelines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many people may seem to have forgotten about COVID, people are still routinely hospitalized and killed by the virus. Additionally, each COVID nfection carries a risk of going on to develop long Covid, which continues to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/health/long-covid-world.html"&gt;debilitate millions of people&lt;/a&gt;. As we witnessed when COVID was a full-blown pandemic, emerging viruses can be especially damaging for people with existing conditions like diabetes, obesity and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to protect against things like long COVID not only for the well-being of people today but also for our susceptibility to future viruses, Rajnarayanan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In different parts of the world, I’ve seen funding for continuous surveillance gone down, and not just for surveillance, which is important, but also studying the disease itself,” Rajnarayanan said. “This is not just about protecting [people] today but also protecting them from any other variant in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;

It formed about 11,000 years ago when a fist of magma punched up into the rolling hills of central France,  creating a volcano that spilled out lava before going dormant just a few hundred years later. For the past twenty years or so, a weather station on top of Puy de Dôme has been equipped with air samplers. The mountain is so high that clouds regularly blanket its peak, allowing scientists to capture some of the life they ferry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Studies led by Pierre Amato, an aerobiologist at the nearby University of Clermont Auvergne, have revealed that every millimeter of cloud water floating over Puy de Dôme &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182869" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;contains as many as 100,000 cells&lt;/a&gt;. Their DNA has revealed that some belong to familiar species, but many &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1186847/full" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;are new to science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Scientists who use DNA to identify species are perpetually anxious about contamination, and Amato is no exception. A hawk soaring over Puy de Dôme might fly over Amato's tubes and shake microbes off its feathers, for example. In Amato's laboratory, a graduate student may exhale germs into a test tube. Over the years, Amato has rejected thousands of potential species, suspicious that he or his students have inadvertently smeared skin microbes onto the equipment. But they have confidently discovered over &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182869" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;28,000 species of bacteria in clouds&lt;/a&gt;, and over 2,600 species of fungi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Amato and other scientists who study clouds suspect that they may be particularly good places for bacteria to survive – at least for some species. "Clouds are environments open to all, but where only some can thrive," Amato and a team of colleagues wrote in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;In a cloud, each microbe exists in perfect solitude, trapped in its own droplet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For bacteria, a cloud is like an alien world, dramatically different from the habitats where they usually live on land or at sea. Bacteria typically crowd together. In rivers they may grow into microbial mats. In our guts, they form dense films. But in a cloud, each microbe exists in perfect solitude, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809510001791" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;trapped in its own droplet&lt;/a&gt;. That isolation means that cloud bacteria don't have to compete with each other for limited resources. But a droplet doesn't have much room to carry the nutrients microbes need to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Yet Amato and his colleagues have found evidence that some microbes can indeed grow in clouds. In one study, the researchers compared samples they gathered from clouds on Puy de Dôme to others they collected on the mountain on clear days. The researchers looked for clues to their activity by comparing the amount of DNA in their samples to the amount of RNA. Active, growing cells will make a lot of copies of RNA from their DNA in order to produce proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The researchers found that the ratio of RNA to DNA was &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/22/1257/2025/bg-22-1257-2025.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;several times higher in clouds than in clear air&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful clue that cells thrive in clouds. They also found that bacteria in clouds switch on genes essential for metabolising food and for growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;To understand how these bacteria can thrive in clouds, the researchers have reared some of the species they've captured in their lab and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.authorea.com/users/908355/articles/1282315-phototrophy-improves-the-aerial-fitness-in-a-photoheterotrophic-methylobacterium-isolated-from-clouds?commit=70193b6f3a38a6c671ea5ac75784f75905678b22" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;then sprayed them into atmospheric simulation chambers&lt;/a&gt;.

The ice then falls back down. If the air near the ground is cold, it may land as snow. If it is warm, it turns to rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It can be surprisingly hard for ice to form in a frigid cloud. Even at temperatures far below the freezing point, water molecules can remain liquid. One way to trigger the formation of ice, however, is to give them a seed of impurity. As water molecules stick to a particle's surface, they bond to one another, a process known as nucleation. Other water molecules then lock onto them and assemble into a crystal structure, which when heavy enough, will fall out of the sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It turns out that biological molecules and cell walls are exceptionally good at triggering rain. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0140407" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Fungi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/aem.01850-20" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;algae&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/5/4/044015/meta" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;pollen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bioone.org/journals/lindbergia/volume-38/issue-1/linbg.01070/Ubiquity-of-ice-nucleation-in-lichen--possible-atmospheric-implications/10.25227/linbg.01070.full" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;lichens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2003JD003545" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/18/4431/2021/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; can &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/10/12/786" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;seed ice in clouds&lt;/a&gt;.

As the wind blows the bacteria off the plants and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.44.5.1059-1063.1982" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;lofts them into the air&lt;/a&gt;, they rise into clouds overhead. Clouds seeded with &lt;i id="pseudomonas" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/i&gt; pour down more rain on the plants below. The plants use the water to grow more leaves, and the leaves support more bacteria, which rise into the sky and spur clouds to rain down even more water to nurture life below. If it turns out to be true, it would be a majestic symbiosis, connecting forests to the sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Research on the life in clouds also raises the possibility that airborne organisms might exist on other planets – even ones that might seem the worst places for life to survive. Venus, for example, has a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead. But the clouds that blanket Venus &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://science.nasa.gov/venus/venus-facts/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;are much cooler&lt;/a&gt;, and perhaps able to sustain life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Pseudomonas bacteria are commonly found in the soil and on plants, but they may be particularly well adapted as the seeds for ice formation (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Pseudomonas bacteria are commonly found in the soil and on plants, but they may be particularly well adapted as the seeds for ice formation (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Sara Seager, an astrobiologist at MIT, has speculated that life might have arisen on the surface of Venus early in its history, when it was cooler and wetter. As the planet heated up, some microbes &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ast.2020.2244" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;could have found refuge in the clouds&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of sinking back to the surface, they may have bobbed up and down in the atmosphere, riding currents for millions of years, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Thinking about Seager's alien aerobiome can make cloud-gazing even more enjoyable. But when we look at clouds, Amato's research has revealed, we are also looking up at our own influence on the world. When Amato and his colleagues have surveyed the genes in the microbes they capture, they find a remarkable number that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.161264" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;endow bacteria with resistance to antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Down on the ground, we humans have spurred the widespread evolution of these resistance genes. By taking excessive amounts of penicillin and other drugs to fight infections, we favour mutants that can withstand them. Making matters worse, farmers feed antibiotics to chickens, pigs and other livestock in order to get them to grow to bigger sizes. In 2014 alone, 700,000 people died worldwide from infections of antibiotic‑resistant bacteria. Five years later, the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;toll rose to 1.27 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The evolution of antibiotic resistance occurs within the bodies of humans and the animals humans eat. The bacteria endowed with this resistance then escape their nurseries and make their way through the environment – into the soil, into streams, and it turns out, even into the air. Researchers have found high levels of resistance genes in the bacteria &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-021-01197-5" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;floating through hospitals&lt;/a&gt; and around &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412023000247" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;pig farms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Winds can carry dust and microbes over hundreds and sometimes thousands of miles (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Winds can carry dust and microbes over hundreds and sometimes thousands of miles (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But airborne resistance genes can waft even further. An international team of scientists inspected the filters in automobile air conditioners in nineteen cities around the world. The filters had captured a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.8b02204" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;rich diversity of resistant bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. It appears, in other words, that resistance genes float through cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In recent years, Amato and his colleagues have charted even longer journeys. In a 2023 survey of clouds, they reported finding bacteria carrying &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722083681" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;29 different kinds of resistance genes&lt;/a&gt;.  A single airborne bacterium may carry as many as nine resistance genes, each providing a different defense against the drugs. Every cubic metre of cloud, they estimated, held up to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722083681" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;10,000 resistance genes&lt;/a&gt;. A typical cloud floating overhead may hold more than a trillion of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Amato and his colleagues speculate that clouds hold such a high number of resistance genes because they can help the bacteria survive there. Some genes provide antibiotic resistance by allowing bacteria to pump the drugs out of their interiors quickly, getting rid of them before they can cause damage. The stress of life in a cloud may cause bacteria to produce toxic waste that they need to pump out quickly as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Clouds may be able to spread these resistance genes farther than contaminated meat and water. Once in a cloud, bacteria can travel hundreds of miles in a matter of days before seeding a raindrop and falling back to Earth. When they reach the ground, the microbes may then pass along their resistance genes to other microbes they encounter. Every year, Amato and his colleagues estimate, 2.2 trillion trillion resistance genes &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://cnrs.hal.science/hal-04300300v1/document" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;shower down from the clouds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It is a sobering thought to hold in one's mind on a walk through the rain.

And that’s not a healthy strategy, said Alison Brown, a nutrition researcher at the National Institutes of Health. Diets like these can cause you to miss out on the range of nutrients your body requires, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;A much better way to maintain healthy eating habits, she added, is to focus on foods that are not only nourishing, but also bring you joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;That can be challenging when nutrition fads are coming and going with seemingly increasing speed, and often conflicting advice.

In one case, a patient refused transfusion from the standard donor pool — insisting on receiving only blood from unvaccinated individuals — and ultimately experienced severe complications during surgery due to delayed transfusion, despite multiple consults and clear explanations that vaccination status has no impact on blood safety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These encounters underscore the growing challenge of misinformation and the ethical tension between respecting autonomy and protecting patients from preventable harm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The safety of the blood supply in the United States and other high-income countries relies on rigorous donor selection and laboratory-based donor testing. The policies, processes, and practices have been refined over decades to ensure both optimal safety and sufficiency of the blood supply. There is overwhelming evidence that anonymous, voluntary donors pose the lowest risk to transfusion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet requests for directed blood donation — blood donated by a specific donor for a specific recipient — have increased since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. These requests most commonly arise from patients or parents who want blood from “unvaccinated” donors. My colleagues and I (an international team of transfusion specialists, ethicists, legal experts, and public health researchers) examined this development in a paper published in &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00815" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. We found that these requests, though often framed as personal preference, raise significant ethical, medical, and logistical concerns that challenge the safety, equity, and integrity of the blood supply.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Directed blood donation is not new. In the early 1980s, shortly after the discovery of HIV and prior to the availability of tests for the virus, some patients made requests for relatives or friends to donate, assuming that they would be safer than community blood donors. Advances in donor screening, infectious-disease testing, and blood processing have since rendered standard donations extraordinarily safe, and directed donation declined. Covid-19 prompted a resurgence in requests, given concerns from some people regarding harmful effects of then-nascent mRNA vaccines. National utilization data show an &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10543447/#:~:text=Of%20the%2010%2C764%2C000%20units%20transfused,units)%20were%20for%20autologous%20transfusions." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;11% increase in directed-donor transfusions from 2019 to 2021&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. That is the most recent year for which peer-reviewed data are available, but anecdotally, it seems that this trend has continued or even increased.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;While there are no licensed tests that can reliably determine whether a donor has been vaccinated against Covid-19, directed donation and “unvaccinated blood” have been promoted by some groups, prompting legislators in several U.S. states to introduce bills that could require hospitals to honor such requests. None of those proposals has become law, but the debate has drawn public attention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many people assume that directed donations are inherently safer, or that receiving blood from a relative increases the likelihood of a better outcome from transfusion. However, this is not supported by evidence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, directed donors are often first-time or infrequent donors. Because of this, they are more likely to pose risks to blood safety. Large studies cited in our review indicate that first-time parental donors have higher rates of markers for transfusion-transmissible infections than community donors (8.6% vs. 1.1% in one series). A likely reason is social pressure: People donating for someone they know may not disclose high-risk behaviors on the donor history questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second, when a donor is a relative, partial genetic matching can — perhaps surprisingly — increase the risk of transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD), a rare but often fatal complication. To prevent TA-GVHD, cellular blood components from related donors must be irradiated, which reduces the shelf life of the donated blood and adds cost. Mother-to-child donations elevate the risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury, and transfusions between reproductive partners can lead to immune responses that can harm future pregnancies by attacking the fetus’s red blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are other problems with directed donations. Every directed unit must be collected, labeled, and stored separately. If the intended patient ultimately does not need the blood, the unit may be discarded because it was kept out of routine inventory rotation. Directed donations cannot be mobilized quickly in emergencies; the blood may arrive too late or in insufficient quantity for patients with large transfusion requirements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, extensive surveillance has found no difference in outcomes between recipients of blood from vaccinated versus unvaccinated donors. Because directed donation introduces additional infectious and logistic risks without offsetting medical advantages, our group concluded that it should be reserved for rare, medically justified situations such as patients with rare blood types and/or multiple antibodies, both of which may pose challenges for procurement of blood from community (i.e., random) blood donors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So what should doctors do with a patient insisting on “unvaccinated blood”?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the ethical principle of autonomy argues that we as physicians provide patients the ability to make their own decisions, it does not obligate health care providers to provide non-evidence-based or potentially harmful products or interventions, which is what our analysis argues that directed donations are. As such, if the patient outright refuses any other blood product, that is their prerogative, but physicians should not acquiesce to provide a directed or Covid-19 vaccine negative unit to meet their needs, as there are no data that supports the efficacy of this product — but numerous data suggest it is more harmful.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blood is a limited, life-saving resource. Policies that allocate it are designed to balance autonomy, safety, and equity. Granting non-medical donor preferences can unintentionally undermine that balance:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equity: Allowing one preference may legitimize another, even if not health-related; examples include requests based on race or gender.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Public trust: Segregating blood on grounds that are not supported by evidence could imply that standard blood is inferior, eroding confidence in established safety measures.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Supply strain: Redirecting donors toward specific recipients reduces the community pool and can exacerbate shortages, particularly during crises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Our analysis recommends that health systems and policymakers continue to prioritize anonymous, need-based allocation and decline directed donation requests that lack medical necessity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Transfusion services in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand have reported similar inquiries about unvaccinated blood. Many patients accept explanations once they learn how universal screening works, though a subset remain concerned. To date, professional bodies such as the Canadian Blood Services and the New Zealand Blood Service have maintained policies that disallow non-medically indicated directed donations, reinforcing consistency across systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given the political climate and ubiquity of misinformation, I suspect that requests for unvaccinated blood will continue apace or even increase. But clear patient-centered communication and transparent publishing of safety data have historically reduced unwarranted fears about blood transfusion. The key is sustained, fact-based engagement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That kind of engagement requires:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plain language: Clinicians should explain that blood banks do not record vaccination status and that strict testing and donor deferral using the donor history questionnaire makes blood that is donated by anonymous community donors safe for transfusion.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Clear institutional policy: Hospitals should have consistent procedures for handling directed-donation requests, including medical-director review and documentation of informed refusal if a patient declines standard blood.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Professional alignment: National and international societies can issue statements affirming that non-evidence-based directed donation is discouraged, providing clinicians with an authoritative reference.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Legislative outreach: Sharing data with policymakers before new bills are drafted can help avert well-intended but impractical mandates that could compromise safety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Directed blood donation occupies a small corner of transfusion practice, but a visible one. By discussing the risks and lack of benefit more clearly with patients, I hope that we can uphold public confidence in our rigorously tested donor system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating mangoes can do more than just satisfy your sweet tooth. Eating mangoes regularly has been linked to many positive health outcomes, in part thanks to their &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290550/10-everyday-superfoods/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;naturally occurring good-for-you nutrients&lt;/a&gt; like beta carotene and a range of plant compounds such as phenolics, polyphenols and tannins.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, one study found that adults eating certain types of mango pulp daily for eight weeks experienced a noticeable drop in their systolic blood pressure, which is important for heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While these findings are promising, more research is needed to understand if these benefits apply to other groups, like postmenopausal women, who are at risk for heart and metabolic issues.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To bridge this knowledge gap, researchers out of the University of California, Davis, explored whether &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mango-benefits-11727631" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating Ataulfo mangos every day&lt;/a&gt; has any impact on heart-health measures among postmenopausal women who are either considered to be overweight or who have obesity, and the results were published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Nutrition Association&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To conduct this study, researchers recruited women ages 50 to 70 who were postmenopausal and living in California. This study was conducted over four weeks, with participants attending three study visits. Before each visit, the participants avoided strenuous exercise for 24 hours, and they came to the research center after fasting overnight.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The women were also instructed not to eat mangoes at least a week before the first visit or during the study. Participants also submitted sets of food logs during the study, so researchers could get a sense of their typical eating habits. At the first visit, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-blood-pressure-factors-study-11742722" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;health measurements like blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and body stats were taken after a period of rest. Two hours later, measurements were repeated to check for any changes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At the second visit two weeks later, participants ate 330 grams of mango, or about 2 cups of the fruit. Researchers conducted health checks before participants ate mango and two hours after. They were then asked to eat one packet of frozen mango (330 grams) daily for the next two weeks—half in the morning and the other half in the evening. At the final visit, after another overnight fast, the same health checks were repeated, participants ate mango again and more measurements were taken two hours later. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Based on the results from the first study, researchers conducted a follow-up trial with just six participants. Measurements like blood pressure and blood samples were taken before they ate anything, then again one hour and two hours later. On one visit, they ate fresh mango pulp. On another visit, they consumed white bread with similar calories and carbohydrates as the mango. Measurements were repeated at the same time intervals after eating to study any changes in blood pressure and blood markers. Each visit was spaced at least two days apart.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study began with 28 participants. However, one person did not complete the study, and three others had issues with their data that prevented it from being included in the final analysis. At the end of the study, 24 participants were evaluated.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study found that eating mangoes had specific effects on heart and blood pressure measurements. Initially, there was no noticeable difference in arterial stiffness between the study visits. However, after eating mango pulp, arterial stiffness was reduced by 35% to 38% two hours later during both mango-eating periods. Arterial stiffness is a measurement of the flexibility of your blood vessels—basically, how easily they respond to changes in blood pressure. Stiff arteries can be a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/happiness-may-help-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-stroke-8714853" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;risk factor for heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Blood pressure taken while seated remained stable initially, but after two weeks of daily mango intake, certain blood pressure measures after meals improved. For example, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/5-minutes-exercise-blood-pressure-study-8742275" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;systolic blood pressure dropped significantly&lt;/a&gt; compared to the no-mango period, decreasing by 6 mmHg. Diastolic blood pressure also lowered slightly, by 2.7 mmHg. Overall, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mango-benefits-11727631" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;regular mango intake&lt;/a&gt; seemed to positively influence certain aspects of heart health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Two weeks of mango eating was also associated with a drop in cholesterol levels, which decreased by 9 mg/dL. There were short-term changes observed, too: &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/hdl-vs-ldl-cholesterol-whats-the-difference-11678853" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;LDL (bad) cholesterol decreased&lt;/a&gt; by 9.6 mg/dL two hours after eating, but only once mangoes were part of the daily diet for two weeks. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After eating mangoes every day for two weeks, participants’ &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-your-blood-sugar-is-too-low-11746496" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blood sugar levels were noticeably lower&lt;/a&gt; two hours after eating compared to when they hadn’t started the mango routine yet. Specifically, blood sugar dropped by 5 mg/dL two hours after eating, showing a positive change. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Six participants with slightly higher fasting blood sugar levels joined a second trial to explore how their bodies process glucose after eating. The study found that eating white bread caused both a drop in blood pressure and an increase in heart rate, while &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7833638/foods-to-keep-blood-sugar-in-check/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;mango consumption led to lower blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt; compared to white bread. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, insulin levels were highest after eating white bread and stayed elevated longer than after eating mango. Eating mango caused a smaller and shorter insulin response compared to bread, and skipping food entirely led to the lowest insulin levels of all. These results suggest that mango may be a good choice for someone looking to satisfy a sweet tooth while managing their blood sugar levels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It is important to consider certain limitations of this study when interpreting these results. One limitation of this study is the large amount of mango participants ate. Though the 330 grams of mango used in this study was intended to explore the fruit’s potential benefits, it’s worth noting that most people consume much smaller portions. The researchers share that women of childbearing age typically eat about 90 grams of mango daily, and adults over 60 eat around 91 grams. Future studies using these more common portion sizes would be valuable. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another noteworthy limitation of the study is the small sample size. A limited number of participants may reduce the generalizability of the findings and increase the likelihood of statistical anomalies, making it more difficult to draw robust conclusions. Future studies with larger and more diverse participant pools would help validate these results and provide greater insight. Finally, because the study involved postmenopausal women, the findings can’t automatically apply to other groups. And it’s worth considering that this study was funded in part by the National Mango Board.
&lt;/p&gt;

While the study suggests eating 2 cups daily, you might not need to go all-in to see benefits. Even smaller, consistent portions may make a difference, especially when paired with other healthy habits like regular exercise and a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;balanced, nutrient-rich diet&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether blended into a smoothie, tossed into a salad or simply enjoyed on their own, these golden fruits provide a simple, satisfying way to fuel your body and support overall health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pro tip: Frozen, freeze-dried, dried and canned mangoes provide the same nutrients as fresh options, giving you even more choices for including this fruit in your diet. Just be sure to look out for excess added sugar in packaged versions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This recent study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Nutrition Association&lt;/em&gt; showed some intriguing potential benefits of adding mangoes to your diet, particularly if you are in the postmenopausal stage of life. The research found that eating Ataulfo mangoes regularly was linked to reduced blood sugar levels, improved cholesterol markers and lower arterial stiffness after meals. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ultimately, this study adds to the growing evidence that mangoes are more than just a delicious tropical fruit; they’re a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290550/10-everyday-superfoods/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nutrient-rich addition to a healthy, balanced diet&lt;/a&gt;. Whether you’re trying to enhance your heart health, manage blood sugar or simply enjoy the natural sweetness of mangoes, these findings make a compelling case for including them in your meal rotation (as if we needed another reason to love them). Just remember to enjoy mangoes as part of a varied, nutrient-dense diet tailored to your specific health goals and lifestyle. After all, the best dietary choices are sustainable, enjoyable and balanced—qualities that mangoes certainly bring to the table!&lt;br&gt;

Scientists want those later decades to feel less like overtime and more like prime time, so they are probing ways to postpone the biological slide that usually accelerates after age 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One avenue getting serious attention swaps crash diets for chemistry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/can-caloric-restriction-help-you-live-longer-its-complicated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cutting calories&lt;/a&gt; without malnutrition stretches the life of mice, worms, and even rhesus monkeys, but sticking to that routine is tough and can cause dizziness, brittle bones, and hair thinning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are hunting for pills that give the same benefits while letting dinner stay on the plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-importance-of-aging-research"&gt;Importance of aging research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aging drives most top killers – &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/morning-coffee-drinkers-have-a-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-scientist-discovers-that-common-non-cancer-drugs-when-combined-can-kill-cancer-cells/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dementia-was-extremely-rare-in-ancient-times-so-why-is-it-now-so-prevalent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; – by pushing cells toward dysfunction. Delaying the underlying process could reduce the burden of several conditions at once instead of treating each separately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health economists note that trimming even a few years off late-life disability would save billions in care costs and lift quality of life for millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most drug discovery still targets single diseases, yet a growing field called geroscience treats aging itself as the root cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caloric-restriction mimetics, or CRMs, sit high on the wish list because they tap into &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/intermittent-fasting-slows-aging-by-boosting-cell-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolic circuits&lt;/a&gt; that animals already use to survive lean times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When those circuits turn on, cells tidy up damaged proteins, improve energy use, and bolster stress defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-caloric-restriction-and-its-hurdles"&gt;Caloric restriction and its hurdles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dietary-restriction-slows-brain-aging-and-increases-lifespan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;caloric restriction&lt;/a&gt; usually means eating 20–40 percent fewer calories than normal for years on end. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence in rodents is striking, but people find the regimen unsustainable, and severe energy cuts can weaken immunity. A safer strategy aims to flip the same molecular switches with medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computational screening tools now search drug libraries for compounds that make human cells mimic the gene-expression profile seen under calorie shortfall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach is faster than testing each molecule in live animals first and often highlights drugs already approved for other conditions, cutting years off the path to clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rilmenidine-common-pill-fights-aging"&gt;Rilmenidine – common pill fights aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One surprising hit from these searches is rilmenidine, a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/rilmenidine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hypertension medicine&lt;/a&gt; taken by mouth for three decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After machine-learning models flagged it, a team led by molecular biogerontologist João Pedro Magalhães at the &lt;a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Birmingham UK&lt;/a&gt; put it to the test in &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt;, a small soil worm favored by aging researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the first time, we have been able to show in animals that rilmenidine can increase lifespan,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same trial delivered another bonus: older worms benefited almost as much as young ones, hinting that humans would not need to start treatment in middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug’s safety record also helps. Doctors prescribe rilmenidine worldwide for high blood pressure, and side effects are rare and relatively mild: they include palpitations, insomnia, and drowsiness in a few cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Magalhães noted, “We are now keen to explore if rilmenidine may have other clinical applications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-rilmenidine-acts-inside-cells"&gt;How rilmenidine acts inside cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rilmenidine binds to imidazoline receptors, tiny docking stations on cell membranes that regulate metabolism. In worms, one receptor called &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Characterization-of-NISH-1_fig1_355334171" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nish-1&lt;/a&gt; turned out to be essential. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that the lifespan-extending effects of rilmenidine were abolished when nish-1 was deleted,” the research team explained. They then re-introduced the receptor gene. Rescuing the nish-1 receptor reinstated the increase in lifespan after treatment with rilmenidine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those findings outline a clear pathway for future drug tweaks aimed at boosting potency or reducing any unwanted effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downstream from nish-1, the treated worms ramped up autophagy – the cell’s waste-disposal system – and tolerated heat stress better than untreated peers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither developmental timing nor fertility shifted, suggesting the drug targeted aging pathways rather than growth or reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-testing-across-species"&gt;Testing across species&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/rna-junk-is-crucial-for-human-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shares many genes&lt;/a&gt; with humans, yet researchers need data from mammals before moving to people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Birmingham group therefore fed rilmenidine to mice and saw gene-expression changes in liver and kidney tissue that matched the classic caloric-restriction signature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood biomarkers of metabolism shifted toward youthful levels, reinforcing the idea that the pill taps into ancient survival programs conserved across species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the compound is already approved, early-phase human trials could focus directly on biological markers such as &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-loss-has-a-greater-impact-on-heart-health-than-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;inflammatory proteins&lt;/a&gt;, insulin sensitivity, and muscle strength. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rilmenidine’s oral delivery is a practical advantage over drugs that require injections or special diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-of-rilmenidine-and-anti-aging"&gt;Future of rilmenidine and anti-aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longer human studies must still rule out subtle harms and confirm that improved markers translate into healthier years. Even so, experts see momentum building. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With a global aging population, the benefits of delaying aging – even if slightly – are immense,” Magalhães said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators will need fresh guidelines for drugs that target aging rather than a diagnosed disease, and ethicists are debating fair access. Yet the prospect of taking a small daily tablet instead of counting every calorie is hard to ignore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If rilmenidine or similar compounds keep proving safe and effective, the next generation of seniors may find that staying healthy deep into their eighties feels less like luck and more like routine science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.13774" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Aging Cell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 22:46:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQR1FveUFHRGozV2FrcTBKNURmRDRwdmlMMWpBaU1Ockw3VnNRWlBTS28xSnhlRkZVQTN3ZFUzZWNVOXFYT2QwTm1zOElqWndNNHN2RDI1NGlhYTZEVEowRXRuT3BkSkZkRXhJeFNsZi1FWFgxcjBIMVFrLU9jMFE0UkJDRk44WnBZQ0FhdG9UUEQ3R05IMHVNd1hkNTZiUXE1VnVURGpRNUt4Tm9PX3RoVUV3</guid></item><item><title>Berks在水系统中发现军团菌后关闭南校区- Reading Eagle | Berks closes South Campus after legionella bacteria found in water system - Reading Eagle</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxQLXJfblotTTNzODgzTV9ETXY3VDdxUHFFcExTNG85dDBiSjRRdW9reGREMGpNRzdzU1lWWkF2Nmd4dEtPZ1gwTnA3OTVROWZOVTBDeWFEbVQzS2NsYlZEbWJQTUVYZ1FKRDVQUHhxZ1Q0ZlpLYjY0ck83bmVoWFhCMXNvQmM4WHlUUWtwT2luLUtCMHVsZGdVQzlmd1d0VU9YZkdtRlFn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-remixd-voice-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Berks County South Campus has closed its doors after a bacteria with potentially fatal consequences was found in the building’s water supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials announced Tuesday that preliminary results of water tests indicated the presence of legionella in the water system at the Mohnton facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legionnaires’ disease is a type of severe pneumonia that can prove fatal for about 10% of people infected, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As well as pneumonia symptoms, it can cause diarrhea, nausea and confusion among those infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of an abundance of caution, they have taken the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• County workers at the South Campus have been dismissed for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• The Facilities Department has ordered portable bathrooms and an enclosed, potable drinking water and utility water supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• All access to water and bathrooms in the building is being restricted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to advised protocols, officials said the building can be occupied safely while these alternative measures for bathroom and water access are in place.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;The South Campus will be closed while the water system is chlorinated over the weekend. The departments and agencies affected include planning, assessment, mapping, community and economic development, archives, the workforce development board, the industrial development authority, the area agency of aging, the Berks County Book Bonanza and the offices of District Judge David Yoch.&lt;/p&gt;

Obviously, one in the fall to prevent the winter increase, but another right now in order to help prevent serious disease during the late summer and early fall,” Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;This goes for people 65 and older, younger people with underlying chronic medical conditions and pregnant people, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;“The recommendation is take special precautions and get that extra dose, because if we get infected ... we get that extra protection and to help keep us out of the hospital,” Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Wearing a mask in indoor spaces, social distancing, washing your hands often and increasing ventilation when possible are more ways to protect yourself from COVID and other respiratory viruses, too, said Burns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you do get sick, there are treatments available.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative col-body mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-[0.875rem]/[1.25rem] mt-1  line-clamp-2 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Oleg Breslavtsev / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;If you have any COVID symptoms, such as sore throat, fatigue, cough or fever, take a test to see if you have COVID. If you are infected, get in touch with your doctor, particularly if you’re high-risk as there are treatments available, said Schaffner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;It’s important that you talk to your primary care provider as the guidance will vary depending on your age, underlying conditions and other risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;COVID is a miserable infection, Horn added. “Over-the-counter meds help — Ibuprofen alternating with Tylenol, if you’re able to take those ... there’s no reason to be miserable,” Horn said. “So, take the medicine that you are able to take to help,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;It’s also important to stay hydrated when you’re sick even if you do have a painful sore throat. A sore throat can make hydration feel like more of a chore, but it’s important to drink water and herbal teas as dehydration can further irritate the dry membranes in your throat, Horn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;“If you are sick, it’s best to keep your germs to yourself,” said Horn. This means canceling the dinner plans, not going to the party and calling out of work if you can — if you can’t, wearing a tight-fitting mask is key, Horn added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;“Preventing transmission is the biggest thing that we can do to help keep everybody healthy,” Horn said.&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/razor-sore-throat-painful-covid-symptom_l_6846f28ee4b0bf9944bd1061" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HuffPost.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/fabianabuontempo/things-women-do-that-make-men-feel-giddy?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:&amp;quot;It's Nice To Feel Wanted&amp;quot;: Guys Are Sharing The Small Gestures Women Do That Make Them Weak At The Knees;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;"It's Nice To Feel Wanted": Guys Are Sharing The Small Gestures Women Do That Make Them Weak At The Knees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/hannahloewentheil/modern-trends-that-should-disappear?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:&amp;quot;I Can't Wait For This To Go Out Of Style&amp;quot;: People Are Sharing Popular Modern Trends That Are Actually Pretty Toxic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;"I Can't Wait For This To Go Out Of Style": People Are Sharing Popular Modern Trends That Are Actually Pretty Toxic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/rachelblatt/love-life-died-signs-medium-essay?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:I Was Devastated When The Love Of My Life Died.

&lt;p&gt;“In the past, as new variants have come on the scene, there almost invariably have been questions about distinctive symptoms, and after a while, when you gather a lot of data, turns out not to be the case — all of these symptoms have occurred before,” said &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7891403" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. William Schaffner&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of preventive medicine in the department of health policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meaning, the circulating COVID variants tend to produce the same sort of symptoms and disease as the ones from years ago, Schaffner added. “Although the more recent variants, these omicron variants, are less severe,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very sore throat isn’t specific to the circulating COVID variants, said &lt;a href="https://www.nationaljewish.org/doctors-departments/carrie-a-horn" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7891403" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Carrie Horn&lt;/a&gt;, the chief medical officer and chief of the division of hospital and internal medicine at National Jewish Health in Colorado. Instead, it’s a symptom that has been associated with COVID infections for a while, Horn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schaffner had not heard of the “razor blade” sore throat symptom particularly, but has heard of people having a severe sore throat with COVID infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some people can have a very sore throat that could be described as razor-like, it doesn’t mean it’s going to happen to everyone — and it also isn’t some new, scary symptom that is associated with new COVID infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is not one outstanding COVID symptom that marks an infection, said &lt;a href="https://uoflhealth.org/provider/mark-burns/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7891403" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Mark Burns&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease expert at UofL Health in Louisville, Kentucky. “A sore throat is a symptom of this, but also fever and cough and fatigue, these are all symptoms as well,” Burns added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To sum it all up, the symptoms, including sore throat, are really no different. There’s no increased intensity based on sore throat or anything like that,” added Burns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how you can protect yourself from a COVID infection:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

Instead, it tweaked the recommendation for healthy children to say it was subject to “shared clinical decision-making” by the parent and doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-component  b-margin-bottom-d40-m20  image-landscape" data-index="24"&gt;&lt;div class="image-component-image inline "&gt;&lt;div class="enlargeImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="photo-credit-text"&gt;Credit: AP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="[object%20Object]" class="image-expand" alt="icon to expand image"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="photo-credit-text"&gt;Credit: AP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="25"&gt;As before, parents could choose. And because it was on the schedule, insurance companies would pay and public health vaccine programs for lower-income kids would supply it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="PX01 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="27"&gt;When it comes to healthy pregnant women, they had always been included without being named, because pregnancy is one of the underlying health conditions that makes the vaccine important for adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="28"&gt;That didn’t change, said William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="29"&gt;“Yes, providers are still carrying and offering this vaccine to their VFC-eligible patients,” said Georgia Department of Public Health spokesperson Nancy Nydam Shirek, speaking of the Vaccines for Children government vaccine supply program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="30"&gt;Rick Ward, a spokesperson for the Georgia Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, agreed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="31"&gt;“It hasn’t been taken out,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="HP03 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="33"&gt;The Georgia Office of the Commissioner of Insurance says they do not expect last month’s changes to affect private plans purchased on &lt;a href="https://georgiaaccess.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;Georgia Access&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;Shake-up underway&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="36"&gt;The public health landscape began shifting again Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="37"&gt;The scientists and doctors who draft the CDC immunization schedule, and who submit it to the CDC director, are called the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="38"&gt;Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic, fired the entire membership of ACIP on Monday afternoon. He said he intends to replace them with members who have a different perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="39"&gt;“A clean sweep is necessary to reestablish public confidence in vaccine science,” Kennedy said in his statement. “ACIP new members will prioritize public health and evidence-based medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="HP04 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="41"&gt;ACIP members make their decisions in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;public meetings and debates that anyone can view&lt;/a&gt;. ACIP’s members have tended to be scientists with long careers in research or medical practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="42"&gt;The American Medical Association, the nation’s organization of doctors, said in a statement that Kennedy’s move would have the opposite effect from building confidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="44"&gt;“Today’s action to remove the 17 sitting members of ACIP undermines that trust and upends a transparent process that has saved countless lives,” the AMA statement said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="45"&gt;ACIP is currently scheduled to have its next meeting later this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;How to choose a vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="47"&gt;In the mean time, parents and patients can always look at the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/presentation-slides-june-26-28-2024.html" target="_blank"&gt;public research&lt;/a&gt; and debates provided in past ACIP meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="HP03 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="49"&gt;Never saying a vaccine is perfect, ACIP members typically weigh whether getting a vaccine is safer than not getting the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="50"&gt;They have made decisions both ways. For some patients, ACIP has decided that risks of side effects tip the scale against getting the shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="51"&gt;For most pregnant women and their babies, the scale is on the side of getting the COVID-19 vaccine, ACIP decided. That’s because data suggests that not getting the vaccine could be more dangerous for both the fetus and the mother. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="52"&gt;There’s a higher rate of premature babies associated with moms who have COVID-19. In the Delta pandemic wave, there was a higher rate of stillbirths for babies of women who had COVID-19. Fetuses and newborns under 6 months cannot get the COVID-19 vaccine themselves, so they depend on getting it through their mom when she’s pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="54"&gt;As for the mothers themselves, pregnancy puts women at risk of blood conditions like preeclampsia and blood clots. And COVID-19 is actually a vascular disease — capable of producing dangerous blood problems like microclots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="HP04 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="56"&gt;Pregnancy and COVID-19 together can be even more dangerous. Research shows pregnant women who get COVID-19 are more likely to wind up in the ICU or die than are other people who get the disease, the &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/" target="_blank"&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="57"&gt;After calculating how many people are protected from COVID-19 by getting the vaccine, the ACIP members calculated that in general it’s safer for them to get it than not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="58"&gt;As of Sept. 24, the CDC’s webpage for pregnant women &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/pregnant-or-breastfeeding.html#:~:text=Everyone%20ages%206%20months%20and,pregnancy%20is%20safe%20and%20effective." target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: “If you are pregnant or were recently pregnant, you are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, compared to those who are not pregnant. Additionally, if you have COVID-19 during pregnancy, you are at increased risk of complications that can affect your pregnancy and your baby from serious illness from COVID-19.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="59"&gt;When it comes to healthy children, ACIP members have recently seemed to be easing back on their support, said Schaffner, the Vanderbilt professor, who previously served as medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. He wouldn’t have been surprised to see the recommendation for healthy kids scaled back by ACIP members who lost their jobs Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AJC.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 20:21:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNdjlvM0d4TnRKQjhzWGR5aTUtWF9GZUhsRUNtLXJKd1M5c1lKZ1FqMXdMQXRycnVPc0ZQdGRUeUdMT3NVdzNMWTdENzh4bmUwcGpUbjhhR1A0dWU1VDducElIOVNwck9uQ1dXYXZVMHV3MnczUTFYN3k0WkFkNzh4TzNuWERZaEFTUUdtQUpiNFF4ZlRVUmpMbVM0T21KS3BtdEV3UWV3eml0ZjhKd0Rj</guid></item><item><title>在伯克斯县南校区的供水系统中发现军团菌- WFMZ.com | Legionella bacteria found in water system at Berks County's South Campus - WFMZ.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi7wFBVV95cUxNUUpGQmtoN1RkLWtwLXpKZVU3cXJabXAwYm9jOFVjUjNVSUN1ZmpXeHNRVjZSSXpVaWhjcWlZX29pOGhUc1VlanEwRUR5QXUzS3lTaWdOSlZFTkdDNUs2VldvSGpMcHRTWGE0eGs0NVhnU1ZaZUxjQUw4eU5lbEhzNG5TZ2lINkY3LUlwMDF6NDZPU3E3TWg2dXZPZjAyOTY2c3pPb2l3Z3B5UmRuN1pERGwyRjdNaW5oZFB5ZHd2encwTnhVT1RENko4cE00NkMyWldfblJDUy1aRUFGV3NlZ191ZlpVNjlzT3VtcDdLOA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody" class="asset-content  subscriber-premium" false&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;MOHNTON, Pa. - Officials say test results of the water system at Berks County's South Campus have come back positive for legionella bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The County of Berks was made aware Tuesday of preliminary results of water tests that indicated the presence of legionella in the water system of the South Campus facilities located at 400 E. Wyomissing Ave. in Mohnton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legionella is a bacterium known to cause Legionnaires' disease, a severe form of a lung infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staff at the location were informed about the situation Tuesday afternoon, and out of an abundance of caution, Berks County took the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;County staff at the South Campus were dismissed for the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The county's facilities department ordered portable bathrooms and an enclosed, potable drinking water and utility water supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All access to water and bathrooms in the building were being restricted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to advised protocols, county officials said the building can be occupied safely while these alternative measures for bathroom and water access are in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The South Campus facilities will be closed while the building's water system is chlorinated over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Grace Kim, an infectious disease doctor with Reading Hospital, says legionella is "a bacteria that can be found in water systems and in even in soil."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was encouraged to hear that they detected it in the water system, which means they were doing surveillance, monitoring, to make sure that there isn't legionella growing," Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria is caught by breathing it in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not passed from person to person," Kim said. "You can't get it off of surfaces. It has to be gotten through the vapor or the mist."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And not everyone gets infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately, it's the most susceptible people that get the infection, a pneumonia form — you know, the elderly and those who have preexisting medical problems," Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-image layout-horizontal  subscriber-hide  tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-image tnt-inline-relation-child tnt-inline-presentation-default tnt-inline-alignment-default tnt-inline-width-default"&gt;&lt;figure class="photo layout-horizontal hover-expand letterbox-style-blur"&gt;&lt;span class="expand hidden-print" data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-7ef21b0a-d193-4d0a-b734-9f2cb8f9af7e" data-instance="#gallery-items-156c6805-f54c-4953-bad1-b3ed4010878b-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-156c6805-f54c-4953-bad1-b3ed4010878b"&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria can cause Pontiac fever, which the doctor says is like a cold or flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In worse scenarios, it can cause Legionnaires' disease, a type of pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it's the pneumonia, what they will have is a typical pneumonia symptoms — fevers, cough, shortness of breath — and they would need to get evaluated for it by going to the emergency room, getting X-rays, and there's a relatively very fast test for using the urine to detect legionella," Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said it takes two to 14 days to develop symptoms and that an infected person should wait until then to come into the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no treatment if you don't have the symptoms," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most who become infected, Kim said, will be OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It can be deadly in anywhere from two to 10% of the patients," she said. "It can cause very severe pneumonia and lung failure, but that's the rare version of it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the bacteria frequent more in the warmer weather, they don't infect many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For example, in 2024 — I was just looking through the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] — and I think they had three major outbreaks in the whole United States," Kim said.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The sweetner erythritol has been linked to a higher risk of stroke. It is used in VitaminWater products shown above&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It is also used in Monster Zero products&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers claimed this was 'equivalent to the typical amount... in an artificially sweetened beverage.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the stated amount of sweetener in the beverages typically falls below this threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, Monster Energy Zero contains about two grams of erythritol — according to consumer website &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/product/0070847015208/monster-energy-zero-ultra"&gt;Open Food Facts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile Vitaminwater says less than one percent of its 500 milliliter (ml) bottles contain erythritol, or less than five grams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Quest protein bars also contain up to five grams of erythritol each, according to the &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.questnutrition.com/products/chocolate-brownie-protein-bar"&gt;company's website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Erythritol is about 70 percent as sweet as sugar but contains six percent of the calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can be found in small amounts naturally in some foods, but in diet sodas is often made from processing corn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also isn't easily processed by the body, meaning it is often passed out through urine. Some may, however, be stored in the body — where its effects can build-up overtime. It was approved by the FDA as safe for foods in 2001&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study comes amid a concerning rise in strokes among young Americans, with previous work blaming this on increased stress, a more sedentary lifestyle and higher drug use than past generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Obesity, high cholesterol and diabetes also play a role — all three are more prevalent in young people today than historically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13723595/erythritol-sweetener-heart-attack-sugar-stroke-diet-keto.html"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; from last year, scientists also found that when people are given the sweetener erythritol, cells in their blood that cause clotting become more active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specifically, they found the sweetener caused platelets in the blood to become activated and stick together, forming clots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists believed that paracetamol relieved pain by working only in the brain and spinal cord. But this new research, published in &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, shows that the drug also works outside the brain, in the nerves that first detect pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their discovery centers on a substance called AM404, which the body makes after taking paracetamol. The team found that AM404 is produced right in the pain-sensing nerve endings—and that it works by shutting off specific channels (called sodium channels) that help transmit pain signals. By blocking these channels, AM404 stops the pain message before it even starts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first time we’ve shown that AM404 works directly on the nerves outside the brain,” said Prof. Binshtok. “It changes our entire understanding of how paracetamol fights pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This breakthrough could also lead to new types of painkillers. Because AM404 targets only the nerves that carry pain, it may avoid the numbness, muscle weakness, and side effects that come with traditional local anesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we can develop new drugs based on AM404, we might finally have pain treatments that are highly effective but also safer and more precise,” added Prof. Priel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuropharmacology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5531343b34303836152634233c3a3b7b3d203f3c7b34367b3c39" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Danae Marx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://huji.ac.il" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hebrew University of Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Danae Marx – Hebrew University of Jerusalem&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2413811122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The analgesic paracetamol metabolite AM404 acts peripherally to directly inhibit sodium channels&lt;/a&gt;” by Alexander Binshtok et al. &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The analgesic paracetamol metabolite AM404 acts peripherally to directly inhibit sodium channels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paracetamol has been used for decades to relieve mild-to-moderate pain. Its analgesic effect is mainly attributed to its metabolite, AM404, acting on cannabinoid receptors or TRPV1 channels in central nervous system (CNS) neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we show that AM404 is produced by primary sensory neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It inhibits sodium current in nociceptor neurons, blocking action potential (AP) generation and reducing nocifensive behavior in naïve and inflamed rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We demonstrated that this analgesic effect of AM404 is mediated by its direct inhibition of nociceptive voltage-gated sodium channels (Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;) 1.8 and 1.7 via the local anesthetic binding site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 and 1.7 inhibition was specific for AM404 and not observed with other metabolites of paracetamol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that the analgesic effect of paracetamol is mediated mainly by direct AM404-induced inhibition of nociceptive sodium channels at the peripheral nociceptor neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings lay a foundation for the potential development of AM404 as a selective local analgesic.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 19:24:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE1ZREh0MnlQNXpQSDhTMTFISkFoODRLd1E0OUJIRERLNm9JMDFDS0EtUzlWcUlRaElvVng4VWpJY1V3dkZMODZTX09jR0hMcmZEQVVEZFJjNHVXZVVMSmNvdndSalV2LThiYWMxU2xqTnFHQdIBd0FVX3lxTE1lSnZybkhVM01kc2dQWUNXUXIxbkVqRlpOaXl4Q1JqOUwyVkZKVURaNktfYWVxRVhaRlBDYjJTVXJQQVZ0aDBpeXEyeEFUc1Q0WjdpaTltY1hOcEtsa09QZXd2MmpmQU0wLWhHWlpqMUFibVlkSGgw</guid></item><item><title>对乙酰氨基酚如何在疼痛到达大脑之前使其沉默-神经科学新闻 | How Acetaminophen Silences Pain Before It Reaches the Brain - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE1ZREh0MnlQNXpQSDhTMTFISkFoODRLd1E0OUJIRERLNm9JMDFDS0EtUzlWcUlRaElvVng4VWpJY1V3dkZMODZTX09jR0hMcmZEQVVEZFJjNHVXZVVMSmNvdndSalV2LThiYWMxU2xqTnFHQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Paracetamol (acetaminophen) doesn’t just work in the brain—it also shuts off pain at its source in the peripheral nerves.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists believed that paracetamol relieved pain by working only in the brain and spinal cord. But this new research, published in &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, shows that the drug also works outside the brain, in the nerves that first detect pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their discovery centers on a substance called AM404, which the body makes after taking paracetamol. The team found that AM404 is produced right in the pain-sensing nerve endings—and that it works by shutting off specific channels (called sodium channels) that help transmit pain signals. By blocking these channels, AM404 stops the pain message before it even starts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first time we’ve shown that AM404 works directly on the nerves outside the brain,” said Prof. Binshtok. “It changes our entire understanding of how paracetamol fights pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This breakthrough could also lead to new types of painkillers. Because AM404 targets only the nerves that carry pain, it may avoid the numbness, muscle weakness, and side effects that come with traditional local anesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we can develop new drugs based on AM404, we might finally have pain treatments that are highly effective but also safer and more precise,” added Prof. Priel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuropharmacology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c8aca9a6a9ada5ab88bba9bea1a7a6e6a0bda2a1e6a9abe6a1a4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Danae Marx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://huji.ac.il" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hebrew University of Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Danae Marx – Hebrew University of Jerusalem&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2413811122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The analgesic paracetamol metabolite AM404 acts peripherally to directly inhibit sodium channels&lt;/a&gt;” by Alexander Binshtok et al. &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The analgesic paracetamol metabolite AM404 acts peripherally to directly inhibit sodium channels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paracetamol has been used for decades to relieve mild-to-moderate pain. Its analgesic effect is mainly attributed to its metabolite, AM404, acting on cannabinoid receptors or TRPV1 channels in central nervous system (CNS) neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we show that AM404 is produced by primary sensory neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It inhibits sodium current in nociceptor neurons, blocking action potential (AP) generation and reducing nocifensive behavior in naïve and inflamed rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We demonstrated that this analgesic effect of AM404 is mediated by its direct inhibition of nociceptive voltage-gated sodium channels (Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;) 1.8 and 1.7 via the local anesthetic binding site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 and 1.7 inhibition was specific for AM404 and not observed with other metabolites of paracetamol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that the analgesic effect of paracetamol is mediated mainly by direct AM404-induced inhibition of nociceptive sodium channels at the peripheral nociceptor neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings lay a foundation for the potential development of AM404 as a selective local analgesic.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 19:24:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE1ZREh0MnlQNXpQSDhTMTFISkFoODRLd1E0OUJIRERLNm9JMDFDS0EtUzlWcUlRaElvVng4VWpJY1V3dkZMODZTX09jR0hMcmZEQVVEZFJjNHVXZVVMSmNvdndSalV2LThiYWMxU2xqTnFHQQ</guid></item><item><title>进行了数百次尸检的医生揭示了人们如何“不知不觉地”死于癌症-每日邮报 | Doctor who has performed hundreds of autopsies reveals how people 'unknowingly' die of cancer - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2025, it is predicted that more than 600,000 people will die of cancer in the United States - but within that is a small number who don't even know they have it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While many of these people are treated after their cancer is detected, a pathologist has revealed that he has come across several who unknowingly passed away from the deadly disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Wolfe, who has performed numerous autopsies to determine people's cause of death, recently posted a shocking &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-44e818f0-461e-11f0-b206-f15fdeb071ef"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; sharing three stories from within the last few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@the_dead_letter/video/7511414474931227935"&gt;In the video,&lt;/a&gt; he explained that whilst it is not common, he has performed several autopsies on people - of all different ages - finding their cause of death is not what medics originally thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor began by discussing how one man had complained of a chronic cough before he died which he had blamed on his smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He finally gets so severe, where he can't stop coughing. Now, he's coughing up blood, he gets taken to the ER and they do imaging and he has a complete white out on his lungs,' he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He then codes and dies,' he continued. 'He comes to the autopsy table and I find he does have a horrible &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/pneumonia/index.html" id="mol-b9be0880-4612-11f0-b206-f15fdeb071ef"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; - one of the worst pneumonias I've ever seen in my career - but as I went through the lung I realized the reason why there was pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was because there was a cancerous tumor, a small cell carcinoma of the lung that was encasing the airway,' he explained. 'So what happens is it grows into the airway and closes the airway off and causes a pneumonia behind that, it's called the post obstructive pneumonia secondary to malignancy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In 2025, it is predicted that more than 600,000 people will die of cancer in the United States - but within that is a small number who don't even know they have it (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added that pneumonia is not the cause of death, but the 'end point' of the actual underlying cause, which is cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Without the cancerous tumor blocking the airway, you wouldn't have had the pneumonia,' Dr. Wolfe explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor then listed another example with a younger patient, who was a man in his early 20s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[He had] had several months of abdominal pain, weight loss and fevers, also night sweats, and he refused to go to the doctor to investigate this.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Then the pain became so intense that he finally did go to the ER and they thought it was going to be some kind of appendicitis or ruptured organ,' the medical professional continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sadly, the young man didn't even make it to the CT scanner before he passed away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He wasn't able to be revived,' he somberly recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the man was taken to Dr. Wolfe to perform an autopsy, he found him riddled with cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Wolfe, who has performed numerous autopsies to determine people's cause of death, recently posted a shocking TikTok sharing three stories from within the last few months (stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I opened him up and found cancer in essentially every organ from his clavicles to his pelvis, also in the abdominal wall and the omentum [tissue that drapes over the intestines],' he recalled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor said it was a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma case, explaining: 'The tumor burden just gets so high it messes up the electrolytes for the patient and then they develop cardiac arrhythmia.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The last patient was a 65-year-old man who had colon cancer symptoms, but passed away before he could have a colonoscopy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I [did] the autopsy to determine the cause of death and it turns out he did actually have stage four colon cancer that was metastatic widely throughout his abdomen, and also into his lungs and had basically grown through the wall of the colon,' he shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As per &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/how-long-can-you-have-cancer-without-knowing#takeaway"&gt;Healthline,&lt;/a&gt;

                                        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After nearly two decades of unsuccessful attempts to start a family, a couple at Columbia University Fertility Center has become the first to get pregnant thanks to a groundbreaking AI system designed to find even the rarest sperm. The couple, identified as 38-year-old Rosie and her husband, had spent nearly 19 years trying to conceive and underwent 15 unsuccessful IVF attempts, reports &lt;a href="https://time.com/7291154/doctors-report-first-pregnancy-new-ai-procedure/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They finally found success with a new technology that offers hope to those facing male infertility caused by azoospermia—a condition where no sperm is detectable in semen.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        The AI tool, called STAR (Sperm Track and Recovery), uses an algorithm paired with a fluidic chip that screens samples, searching for rare sperm cells invisible to even experienced embryologists. The approach, developed by Dr. Zev Williams and his team, &lt;a href="https://www.columbiadoctors.org/news/columbia-fertility-looks-stars-help-men-infertility"&gt;borrows from astrophysics&lt;/a&gt;, where AI scans for new stars among billions in the sky; here, it scans millions of cells for scarce sperm. Once found, the sperm can be preserved or used in fertilization. Prior to STAR, men with azoospermia had few options besides using donor sperm or trying invasive and sometimes risky procedures. For Rosie and her husband, STAR found sperm in samples where manual searches found none.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        "The embryologists really worked hard to find sperm, since they didn't want to be outshone by a machine," Williams tells &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;. "In one of the samples they analyzed for two days and found no sperm, STAR found 44 in an hour." Rosie's successful pregnancy in March 2025 did not require any extra IVF testing or steps. Sperm collected with STAR was used immediately to fertilize Rosie's eggs. Now four months along, Rosie reports the experience still feels unreal after years of disappointment. Dr. Williams sees broader potential for AI in tackling other infertility challenges, noting that it may reveal biological details previously missed.  (This content was created with the help of AI.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A dietitian explains how carnivore and high-protein fads miss the mark.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plus, nightshades aren’t harmful as these vegetables are full of nutrients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The dietitian also shares why you can skip daily electrolyte drinks and how water is enough for most routines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; From &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8041459/fad-diets/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fad diets&lt;/a&gt; to trending ingredients, there are so many viral (and mostly problematic) moments in the nutrition space that we’re always keeping our eye on. And we’re not the only ones that are concerned about the internet’s infatuation for “cure-all health hacks.”.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On an episode of the &lt;em&gt;CAPS LOCK&lt;/em&gt; podcast, guest dietitian Vanessa Rissetto M.S., RD, CDN took the stage to debunk today’s biggest nutrition myths.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Here’s what she notes to be the top four health red flags you should be wary of.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-carnivore-diet"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Carnivore Diet &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ah yes, the carnivore diet, AKA the theory that exclusively eating meat will help aid weight loss and muscle growth. If this sounds unrealistic, don’t worry: This dietitian has had enough of it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-protein-and-its-benefits-11732679" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;getting enough protein&lt;/a&gt; in your diet is important, there’s a variety of protein sources that provide more nutritional value than red meat, like fatty fish, beans and legumes, tofu and nuts. And the dietitian does make a point that eating too much red meat is a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/food-to-limit-to-reduce-colon-cancer-risk-11694207" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;risk factor for colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Recent research shows a link between mutations in colon tumors and a diet that includes regular red and processed meat intake.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, any food is OK in moderation, and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7994363/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-red-meat-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;red meat&lt;/a&gt; can provide a great source of vitamin B12 and iron, but anything in excess usually isn’t great for the body. Since this diet does not include fruits, vegetables and grains, there's a risk for nutrition deficiencies, constipation and more health concerns. A balanced eating pattern is the best kind!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-avoiding-nightshades"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Avoiding Nightshades &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7999760/what-are-nightshades-and-are-they-bad-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Nightshades&lt;/a&gt; getting a bad rap isn’t anything new, these veggies (i.e. tomatoes, bell peppers, eggplants and white potatoes) have been the source of mixed reviews over the years, especially by social media influencers. Are they really the inflammatory monsters you need to be avoiding?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Let’s cut to the chase. Nightshades are not the problem—unless you have an intolerance to them. As Rissetto rightfully asks, “What did the tomato ever do to you?” There’s plenty of research that connects these specific vegetables to anti-inflammatory properties, especially due to their phytochemicals and other essential nutrients.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We have consistently given nightshades the seal of approval, and recipes like a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8052446/best-tomato-sandwich/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;summery tomato sandwich&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/breakfast-stuffed-peppers-8654722" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Breakfast Stuffed Peppers&lt;/a&gt; make them all the more enjoyable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-eating-too-much-protein"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Eating Too Much Protein &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s clear that protein has had a major spotlight through trending recipes, viral fast food favorites and celebrity products. But what if we told you that you’re likely already eating enough protein in your day-to-day life?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “You don’t need to eat your bodyweight [in protein],” Rissetto clarifies. Use our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290496/this-is-how-much-protein-you-need-to-eat-every-day/#toc-how-much-protein-do-you-need-each-day" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein calculator&lt;/a&gt; to determine exactly how much protein you need, and you will see that it's only a fraction of your weight. Your body is only able to absorb so much protein, so &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291875/6-signs-you-could-be-eating-too-much-protein/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;eating too much&lt;/a&gt; may not lead to more benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein will keep you satisfied and can help with strength and mobility, but it isn’t the only nutrient you should focus on. Foods packed with fiber and antioxidants like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8004966/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-enough-fruits-vegetables/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt; have a slew of benefits, from gut health to skin health, and they shouldn’t be overlooked because they’re lower in protein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-replenishing-electrolytes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Replenishing Electrolytes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7867963/electrolyte-drinks-what-are-they-and-do-you-need-them/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Electrolytes&lt;/a&gt; can help deter you from dehydration after a strenuous workout, a day in the summer heat or if you’re under the weather. But you don’t need to “replenish electrolytes” every day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “When you go to a 45-minute spin class, you don’t need to replenish anything,” Rissetto explains. “Just drink water.” Of course for special circumstances like running a marathon, having electrolytes is important. In general, water is hydrating enough for your typical day. And many electrolyte drinks on the market have a lot of added sugar, so they’re not ideal for a go-to beverage.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Following a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy eating pattern&lt;/a&gt; and incorporating movement into your routine doesn’t have to be complicated, and it definitely doesn’t need to abide by the latest internet trends. At &lt;em&gt;EatingWell&lt;/em&gt;, we hold the firm philosophy that a balanced, non-restrictive diet is best, and paying attention to both your body’s wants and needs is key. If you’re unsure of what diet or exercise plan makes sense for you, talk to a healthcare professional or dietitian for personalized advice.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="44" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqb0q500173b77dintz8b9@published"&gt;I’m a black woman of color in my late 20s, have been single for about six years, am pansexual, and would like to spend the next year or two in my slut era. I’ve wanted to have this era for the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="154" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqb0se00183b77cskdcev8@published"&gt;I’d like to say that COVID is the main reason why I haven’t had it, but if I’m being honest, it’s because I don’t know where to start. My penetrative sexual experience is pretty limited—I’ve done it twice with two different partners and mostly felt awkward in both encounters—and have very little experience with women/nonbinary people, but would love to explore that. I’m not quite demisexual but need to get coffee or something before I can contemplate sex, and I am not one for one-night stands. I’d rather get coffee than drinks, as I’m not really a nightlife person. I’m awake around 5:30 a.m. without an alarm, so I’d rather be asleep by 9:30 p.m. than up until 2 a.m. at the club. I also have some sensory sensitivities (I’m level 1 autistic) related to bodily fluids (primarily sweat) that don’t bother me unless I’m stuck in my head, which I’m very prone to.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="108" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqb0tz00193b77luqhq2x8@published"&gt;On top of this, my body has changed over the last few years in ways that I’m not the most comfortable with. I’ve primarily experienced weight loss, but I’ve always had some level of body dysmorphia, and it comes with a lot of stretch marks. I do groom regularly, but I’m still a bit hairy down there and don’t want to make partners floss, so to speak. At the same time, though, I know I’m attractive to others. So, how do I kick things off and find my (ideally several) people? And how do I get out of my head enough in the moment to actually enjoy it?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="2" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqb0xs001b3b77nbllh3po@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Sensitive,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqb0z2001c3b77kd2bv6cf@published"&gt;One useful place to start is considering why you want to have this period of multiple sexual connections, and what degree of emotional and intellectual intimacy you’re both hoping for and willing to engage in. Ask yourself what you’re hoping to get out of this stage of your life—yes, an increase in experience, but for what purpose? Do you want to make friends while you’re giving each other orgasms? Are you open to forming romantic relationships if the potential is there, and would you want to keep those relationships open, or would you want to segue into monogamy?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="215" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqb11a001d3b77lzgqkb4r@published"&gt;Meanwhile, Gen Xers and even Millennials—the generations popularly associated with hook-up culture (and expansive access to porn on the internet as chronicled in Sophie Gilbert’s &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/05/porn-american-pop-culture-feminism/682114/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Girl on Girl: How Pop Culture Turned a Generation of Women Against Themselves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)—usually do, and generally always have, preferred a smidge of getting to know each other before going past groping. Think, the taxi ride or walk home from a club, a coffee in a public space when connecting from an app, and even, during the pandemic, a tendency to engage in a video call before meeting up. People anonymously having sex in nightclub bathrooms or going directly to each other’s apartments without exchanging face pictures are, and historically have been, outliers in the grand scheme of sex-having Americans. So, if the demisexual identity fits you in other ways, please do use it, but know that there’s nothing atypical about wanting to know the person you’re about to have sex with to some degree. Another detail that is completely typical is pubic hair. Sure, you may run into someone who—despite much of porn being full of pubes—has strange ideas about hairlessness being the norm, and they may be a jerk about it. Most likely, though, anyone with experience will know how to gently brush any hair out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="114" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqb12r001e3b77w6pxnren@published"&gt;As for getting out of your head and being in the present moment, mindfulness is your best move here. I know it isn’t simple, and you may be thinking it sounds boring (if that’s the case, keep trying different forms until you find one that is engaging). Some autistic adults report that traditional mindfulness practices don’t work as well for them as for neurotypical people, so &lt;a href="https://thinkingautismguide.com/2024/08/mindfulness.html"&gt;here’s a quick list of additional ideas&lt;/a&gt;. The point here is to build your capacity to focus your mind on where you are right now and what you’re feeling in the moment. Find something that works for you and practice it every single day. Eventually, you’ll see results.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="127" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqb148001f3b77tlo4aalp@published"&gt;You’ve got a couple of likely options when it comes to navigating your relationship with your body. You can highlight the parts you’d like to have appreciated, and combine that with engaging your mindfulness skills when someone comments on a part you’d rather ignore. You can also go for the “fake it till you make it” approach and highlight the aspects of your body that people comment positively on most. Know that—while much like with pubic hair, you may occasionally encounter a judgmental jerk—most of the time people are focused on appreciating the person in front of them, and far less likely to notice, much less be turned off by or comment negatively about, the areas you zero in on critically when you look in the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqb15w001g3b77r7vy15zy@published"&gt;To meet folks, ideally, you’d start putting yourself out there in community events that take place during the hours you prefer to be socially active. Apps are always an option (depending on where you live, you’ll have several available to you, and you’ll need to decide which of the bountiful array you’re most interested in trying). You might also consider asking friends whether they know anyone you might match nicely with.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The two fresh Colorado Springs measles cases come amid multiple confirmed cases across Colorado, including in Aurora and Denver – many of which were linked to a Turkish Airlines flight that landed into DIA in mid-May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14600461/Where-worlds-infectious-disease-spreading-US-24-states-report-cases.html"&gt;Colorado officials are warning anyone&lt;/a&gt; who fears they may have been exposed to contact their health provider and monitor for symptoms in what is the latest in a string of measles scares to rock America's major airports and surrounding neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently there have been 1,168 confirmed measles cases in the US and at least three deaths reported by 34 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles is the world's most contagious disease but those who are fully vaccinated are protected in 97 percent of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The current jurisdictions impacted are &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alaska/index.html" id="mol-84dd1750-4608-11f0-9b82-fd8c15ee512c"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/arkansas/index.html" id="mol-84dd3e60-4608-11f0-9b82-fd8c15ee512c"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-84dd8c80-4608-11f0-9b82-fd8c15ee512c"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/colorado/index.html" id="mol-84ddb390-4608-11f0-9b82-fd8c15ee512c"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/florida/index.html" id="mol-84dddaa0-4608-11f0-9b82-fd8c15ee512c"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, Georgia, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/hawaii/index.html" id="mol-84de01b0-4608-11f0-9b82-fd8c15ee512c"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/illinois/index.html" id="mol-84de28c0-4608-11f0-9b82-fd8c15ee512c"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/indiana/index.html" id="mol-84de4fd0-4608-11f0-9b82-fd8c15ee512c"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of these cases, three-quarters are in children under the age of 19. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an updated advisory, the CDC is warning that people can get infected with measles during travel or at crowded events, unless they are fully &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7571481/Measles-warning-travelers-flew-Philadelphia-airport.html"&gt;vaccinated or have had the disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The notice reads: 'Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings, including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Infected travelers can bring the disease back to their home communities where it can spread rapidly among people who are not immune.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The government agency recommends that all travelers be fully vaccinated against measles before traveling to an international destination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Out of studied counties, 78 percent or 1,614 counties reported drops in MMR vaccination rates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cold-like symptoms, such as a fever, cough and a runny or blocked nose, are usually the first signal of measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The last time measles was this rife in the US was in 2019, when there &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6753425/How-completely-avoidable-measles-cases-continue-climb.html"&gt;were 1,274 cases reported for the entire year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prior to that, the biggest outbreak was in 1990, with numbers spiking to more than 27,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles was officially eradicated in the US in 2000 amid a successful vaccination campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-e13a1760-4099-11f0-83cb-973ee3fa2d45"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; described achieving measles elimination status in the US as a 'historic public health achievement'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a recent study found uptake of the vaccine among children declined in eight in 10 US counties last year, which is being &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6063419/Measles-outbreak-sweeping-CDC-reveals.html"&gt;signaled as the cause of the measles resurgence&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, vaccine rates fell three percent across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It means that merely 91 percent of children are vaccinated against measles, which is well below the 95 percent need to prevent the disease from spreading and causing deaths.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Johns Hopkins University researchers warned that if vaccination rates continue to fall, measles is likely to completely return and become a common infection among Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A majority of those infected as well as the all of the deceased had not received their MMR vaccine - primarily due to vaccine hesitancy and misinformation, experts say. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles causes tiny white spots inside the mouth, flat red spots on the neck, torso, arms, legs, and feet, ear infections and an intense fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In terms of when to get vaccinated, experts say children need two doses of MMR vaccine: the first dose at age 12-15 months, and the second dose at age 4-6 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Babies ages 6-11 months should get an early dose if traveling internationally. Adults should also check to see if they are immune to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqoeyoi004n3b76j2r1sxah@published"&gt;One of the regulars, “Annie,” arrived with “Clay,” whom she met at the sex club we all frequent, and said he had brought a “big surprise.” That was an understatement. Clay was packing a nine-inch penis. Suffice it to say, all the women made sure he was properly “welcomed” into our social circle. Ever since then, I have been incredibly depressed. I can’t imagine how I’m ever going to satisfy my wife again. I’m not small, I would say I’m average, but how can I possibly compete with something like that?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqnwi1t001f3b76lfp5ux0u@published"&gt;Do you believe your wife when she tells you things? I ask because an alarming number of men don’t believe women when they express their preferences, especially when those preferences are at odds with men’s own ideals or ideas about what women want. The &lt;a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/dad-bod-body-image-trends-olly-murs-b1224933.html"&gt;recent controversy surrounding William Costello’s poll about Olly Murs’ shifting body&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.wehuntedthemammoth.com/2025/05/02/why-men-get-furious-at-women-who-say-they-prefer-the-dad-bod/"&gt;the many men who then accused female poll respondents of lying&lt;/a&gt;, are stark examples of the way that straight men can struggle with squaring their own expectations and the realities of women’s tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="136" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqnwi41001g3b76k4oxkuhu@published"&gt;If you don’t generally believe your wife, you’ve got a whole other, larger issue. But if you do, share your insecurities with her. Keep in mind that whole infants often pass through people’s vaginal canals, and after birth, those people are still able to enjoy penetrative sex. Remember that bigger—especially longer—often means battering of the cervix, which can make a large penis less attractive in the context of a committed relationship than in the context of a one-off at a sex party. And there’s so much more to sex than the in-and-out of it, at least as far as what women generally find enjoyable. With those facts in your mind as a baseline, listen to what your wife has to say in response to how you’re feeling. Internalize the reassurance she is likely to offer you.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqnwi75001h3b760zyxgb59@published"&gt;It may also help to consider all of the things you bring to your marriage aside from your penis. You are, I’m certain, far more than a life support system for a fleshy, self-driving dildo. If you’re still struggling after taking all of these steps, therapy may be in order. Depression is serious, and if you’re experiencing enough symptoms of it to describe yourself as “incredibly depressed” in response to this one incident, it’s quite possible that there are more factors at play that a professional will be well-positioned to help you address.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="127" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqnxhdy001q3b76mbtpcafq@published"&gt;My girlfriend “Anabel” has been having a problem for a couple of months now. Sometimes when we are having sex, it will feel like she’s about to orgasm and then her pussy will suddenly squeeze my dick so hard it’s painful. I lose my erection and have to wait in near-agony until she unclenches to get out. This has only happened a handful of times, but it’s VERY unpleasant when it does. Anabel is not at all happy about this, but says she doesn’t know how to distinguish between whether she is going to come or clamp up. It’s beginning to affect our love life because, as you can imagine, I am more than a little reluctant to take the risk. What can be done about this?&lt;/p&gt;

Absolutely do not, under any circumstances, encourage Anabel to search up various exercises and try them without professional guidance. It can do more harm than good. Keep in mind that the choice to see a medical professional is Anabel’s at the end of the day, but if she’s open to the idea, you can help by searching for local providers.&lt;/p&gt;

I have had an erratic work schedule for the past five months, and because of this, he claims he has to resort to self-pleasure since I’m never around when he wants sex. There have been plenty of times when I’ve tried to initiate, but he turns me down because (surprise!) it’s been less than an hour since he smacked it. At this point, I’m beginning to wonder if he even truly needs me at all—I can count the number of times we’ve had sex in the last couple of months on one hand without using all my fingers. Should I try and repair the connection that we used to have, or is he sending me a not-so-subtle message that our time together is over?&lt;/p&gt;

Who, unless you’ve left something out, considers sex off the table unless his penis is immediately ready to rise to the occasion? How do you feel about a relationship where your sense of security is based on his desire for sex with you? Where your connection is limited to physical engagement? Think through these questions, and I suspect you’ll have an answer to your own.&lt;/p&gt;

When I finally got out, my body had changed a lot: I’d had several kids, was older, and fatter. But even more than this, I think I just lived in my head for so long… &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/05/sex-hiatus-learning-advice.html"&gt;I feel kind of disconnected from my body.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
