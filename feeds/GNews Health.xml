But extracting enough of the molecules to serve the entire population would be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/delaware/index.html" id="mol-e7e3aab0-931c-11f0-a9b3-618ddb70db89" class=""&gt;Delaware&lt;/a&gt; scientists have invented a method to produce these cancer-fighting compounds in a laboratory by using common chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver cancer afflicts an estimated 42,000 Americans every year and kills about 30,000 annually. Incidence rates for the disease &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14947621/Liver-cancer-surging-rates-50s-obesity.html"&gt;have more than tripled&lt;/a&gt; since 1980, while the death rates have more than doubled during this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;William Chain, associate professor in the university's Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, said: ‘The majority of clinically approved medicines are either made from a natural product or are based on one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But there aren't enough natural resources to make enough treatments. Now chemists will be able to take our manuscripts and basically follow our "recipe" and they can make it themselves.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many medicines, both over-the-counter and prescription, have been derived from &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-6729977/A-diet-rich-grains-slashes-risk-liver-cancer-40-study-finds.html"&gt;natural sources&lt;/a&gt;. Bark of willow trees has been called nature's aspirin. The antibiotic penicillin comes from a mold called Penicillium. And metformin, a common &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-e7e24b20-931c-11f0-a9b3-618ddb70db89"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; medication, was initially derived from the French Lilac plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most recent findings provide scientists worldwide with an easy-to-produce and inexpensive method for creating large quantities of the guava's naturally occurring cancer-fighting molecules in the laboratory. It also opens the door to more effective and accessible liver cancer treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Using common chemicals, scientists can now produce potent cancer-fighting molecules originally found in guava plants&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver cancer deaths among women plummeted through much of the 20th century, but have steadily ticked up to 5.3 deaths per 100,000 cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In men, deaths have remained high since then, reaching 10.1 deaths per 100,000 people with the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The naturally occurring molecule that the University of Delaware chemists synthesized is called (-)-psiguadial A, which has demonstrated a potent ability to stop the growth and division of liver cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists, led by Dr Chain, started by building a key - and complex - component of the cancer-fighting molecule found in the guava plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Creating the correct 3D shape of the component was crucial because the molecule only works if its shape is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once created, they attached it to another key part of the molecule. This was a major hurdle in the research because the specific spots they had to connect were buried and crowded by other atoms, making it difficult to form a new bond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finally, the researchers used a chemical to cause a reaction that made the molecule curl around and connect to itself, forming a special ring-shaped structure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ring is the unique, central part of the natural medicine that gives it its power to fight cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A large number of our medicines, including everyday pills and powerful prescriptions, were first discovered in natural sources including fruits (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said that while they have achieved a crucial first step by creating this molecule in the lab, this is just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The exact mechanism that allows (-)-psiguadial A to kill cancer cells is still under investigation and the researchers still do not fully understand it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers used measurements of (-)-psiguadial A potency taken from experiments on human liver cancer cells grown in petri dishes. Previous studies on the compound have also used animal cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Extracts containing these compounds were tested in samples in lab petri dishes against a broad panel of nine other human cancer lines, including breast, lung, prostate, and ovarian cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the compound itself has not yet been tested in human patients, though the successful synthesis is the first step. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While still years away from human use, their breakthrough paves the way for developing a potential new class of targeted therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ultimate goal is to create a treatment that is more precise and has fewer harsh side effects than traditional chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liam O'Grady, doctoral student in Chain's lab and the article's first author, said: ‘We are the first ones to pave that road, and other people can repave it any which way. Find the shortcuts if they have to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows cases of liver cancer in women are rising, driven by a rise in obesity, diabetes, and fatty liver disease, as well as ongoing issues with alcohol and Hepatitis C&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Liver cancer cases in men are falling, which could be linked to overall lower smoking rates and widespread hepatitis B vaccinations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But since we entered into that unknown territory, I think we helped shed light on this unknown pathway that can get us there. And I think that's the cool part.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They now need experts from various fields to help them study, improve, and ultimately determine if it can become a viable medicine for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research has zeroed in on the anti-cancer benefits of the guava plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023, an international cadre of researchers &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9963020/#:~:text=Recently%2C%20the%20World%20Health%20Organization,cytotoxicity%20towards%20cancer%20cell%20lines."&gt;reported &lt;/a&gt;that a concentrated extract made from guava leaves dramatically slowed down the unchecked growth of liver cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The higher the dose they used, the more cancer cells died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the most potent dose, it stopped over two-thirds of the cancer cells from growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead of just poisoning the cells, the extract triggered the cells' built-in self-destruct program, a process called apoptosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It caused a dangerous build-up of toxic waste and shut down the cells' power supply, leading to their collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver cancer is a fast-growing cancer with few highly effective treatment options, which place a multi-billion-dollar financial strain on the US healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition, the prognosis for advanced liver cancer is dire, with fewer than 15 out of every 100 patients surviving past five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research team has partnered with the National Cancer Institute to test the guava-derived molecule against other types of cancer and to develop it further into a potential treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 20:21:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOWkZNbEhmMUNncnYyNGlieGsxc25uQ2UzaWloNG5wUDd3a2g1RjMyNFl3VnJBRGpRX1VVT0ZKOGFLdkxUS2NKT0sta2RFMkE1TkdHdmRETFgxZS1IR0tQUkJMdmxBMWptaTRPSWRqUi1BNEowc0ZLNExkb1lSQ0dFLUV1MkhXUFcydU9OZUk3OGJRVzA30gGaAUFVX3lxTFA5WmlmUDdwQy1VejJ3cFJrRHRJclNSVXY3Q0N3LTVOQ1EyRnN6SGxuZkdVaWdvU1BHVDV2eEwwY0hPelJjQkVNcHZYOFUwOTBwNHBPd3JURmN3Q29VaEpQdEtPNTZDTGFXU3V2OUtBM1VJbC1xTDBOemt2aGFiTE5aUVN2Ukt1QXhpek1sYU8waFg3RTRYbWdqTWc</guid></item><item><title>Ozempic诉讼：关于最新的视力丧失指控，您需要了解的一切-无聊的熊猫</title><link>https://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If there were a “drug of the summer” award, Ozempic would win hands down. This Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, scientifically known as Semaglutide, was originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes. Today, it’s better known for delivering rapid, dramatic weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ozempic’s meteoric rise has brought increased scrutiny. Its manufacturer, Novo Nordisk, now faces a flood of lawsuits. Patients are alleging a wide range of side effects, from digestive issues to the more alarming claim of irreversible vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Ozempic remains a focal point of ongoing medical research and cultural conversation, these lawsuits have placed the drug at the heart of a high-stakes legal battle. Here’s what you need to know about the controversy that’s reshaping public perception and corporate accountability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Inside the Newest Wave of Ozempic Lawsuit Filings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Person in a blue shirt using a medical device on their abdomen related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="GettyImages-2189925153-68c3c960e3029__880" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?image_id=GettyImages-2189925153-68c3c960e3029__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Ozempic Lawsuit: Everything You Need To Know About The Latest Vision Loss Allegations" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?media_id=GettyImages-2189925153-68c3c960e3029__880" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2189925153-68c3c960e3029__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2189925153-68c3c960e3029__880.jpg" alt="Person in a blue shirt using a medical device on their abdomen related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss allegations." title="Person in a blue shirt using a medical device on their abdomen related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss allegations." loading="lazy"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/self-injection-with-semaglutide-for-obesity-royalty-free-image/2189925153?phrase=ozempic&amp;amp;adppopup=true" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Tatsiana Volkava / Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-tablet-ad-within-content post-ads"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad" data-source="primis"&gt;&lt;span id="desktop-widget-loaded"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk is facing a rapidly escalating legal crisis, with thousands of individual lawsuits filed just this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mass tort litigation, similar lawsuits are often consolidated into a Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) to streamline the legal process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.lawsuit-information-center.com/ozempic-gastroparesis-lawsuit.html" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Lawsuit Information Centre&lt;/a&gt; reports that MDL 3094 was created in February 2024 by the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to handle the growing number of Ozempic-related cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This MDL also includes other semaglutide drugs like Wegovy and Rybelsus, along with Mounjaro, a dual GLP-1/GIP agonist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of its creation, the MDL contained just 55 cases. By August 2024, that figure jumped to 346. As of August 2025, there are 2,190 active cases, with plaintiffs claiming Novo Nordisk failed to adequately warn them about severe side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Vision Loss Is the Flashpoint in the Ozempic Lawsuit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drugwatch.com/legal/ozempic-lawsuit/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Drug Watch&lt;/a&gt; reports that most Ozempic lawsuits initially centered around gastroparesis, bowel obstruction, and cyclical vomiting syndrome. But over time, a growing number of users of Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus began reporting a rare eye condition called Non-Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A July 2024 study published in the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2820255" class=" staff-link"&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Ophthalmology&lt;/a&gt; found a link between Ozempic use and NAION. Novo Nordisk has argued that many of the diabetic patients involved already faced a heightened risk of vision problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in February 2025, a follow-up cohort study in the same journal showed a clearer increase in NAION risk among semaglutide users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2025, twenty-one NAION plaintiffs moved to consolidate their cases in New Jersey state court. This was notable not only because of the severity of the vision claims, but also because Novo Nordisk’s U.S. headquarters is located in Plainsboro, New Jersey. Plaintiffs aimed to challenge the company directly on its home turf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shift in focus from stomach issues to vision loss has changed the tone of the lawsuits entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While gastrointestinal side effects can be managed over time, they rarely result in lasting disability (per &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15522-gastroparesis" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;). NAION, on the other hand, can lead to sudden, irreversible optic nerve damage and permanent vision loss, as reported by the &lt;a class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;American Academy of Ophthalmology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs suffering from vision loss often face total blindness or an inability to live independently. This makes their stories far more powerful to juries and increases the chances of large verdicts or punitive settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What began as a product liability case is now a broader question of public health and corporate responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Patients Are Saying&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozempic prescription pen box on countertop showing medication details related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3c9bb7d942-jpeg__880" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?image_id=Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3c9bb7d942-jpeg__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Ozempic Lawsuit: Everything You Need To Know About The Latest Vision Loss Allegations" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?media_id=Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3c9bb7d942-jpeg__880" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3c9bb7d942-jpeg__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3c9bb7d942-jpeg__880.jpg" alt="Ozempic prescription pen box on countertop showing medication details related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss claims." title="Ozempic prescription pen box on countertop showing medication details related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss claims." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1e5gj8k/help_im_confused_about_the_ozempic_pen_i_have/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;r/Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the clinical terms and legal jargon, it’s the personal stories that are shaping the Ozempic lawsuits. Some complaints include harrowing details of vision loss that paint a picture of suffering, corporate failure, and Big Pharma profit over patient safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_middle_0" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such story comes from James Norris, a mechanic in his late fifties who was prescribed Mounjaro for weight loss. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/lawsuit-alleges-man-diabetes-became-blind-taking-ozempic-rcna202959" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt; reports that Norris was later diagnosed with NAION after his dosage was increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another is Cheryl Bovee, a 56-year-old retail worker from North Carolina. She went legally blind after using Ozempic for her diabetes. In a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/08/health/people-going-blind-after-using-weight-loss-drugs-like-ozempic-and-mounjaro/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt; interview, she said, “I no longer have the hope of seeing my grandchildren. I no longer have the hope of seeing their faces clearly. I can’t have any sort of independence…All of my hopes and dreams have been dashed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These firsthand accounts are a stark contrast to the glowing celebrity endorsements and social media hype that promoted Ozempic as a miracle weight loss drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNnxUpiuZVs/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuits have sparked widespread discussion on forums. A &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1fkmk9l/had_to_stop_ozempic_due_to_eye_issues/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; user said they had to stop using Ozempic due to temporary vision loss. Another shared that their vision became blurry for weeks after a dosage increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These firsthand accounts are now key in the broader legal and public debate, giving a human face to claims that might otherwise be buried in data and court filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is There a Link Between Ozempic and Irreversible Vision Loss?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;While Ozempic has been linked to vision loss through multiple studies and regulatory reviews, a direct causal relationship remains unproven. Research shows an elevated risk of developing Non-Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION) among users, but it’s still unclear whether the drug itself causes the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide mimics the GLP-1 hormone, which promotes feelings of fullness and triggers insulin release to regulate blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/news/can-ozempic-affect-eye-health-here-s-what-ophthalm" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;American Academy of Ophthalmologists&lt;/a&gt; explains that Ozempic may lead to sharp changes in blood sugar, which can alter the shape of the eye’s lens and cause temporary vision issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another theory suggests that semaglutide reduces blood flow to the optic nerve, possibly triggering NAION and resulting in permanent vision damage. This condition is often called a “stroke of the optic nerve” (via &lt;a class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Eye Physicians of Long Beach&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complicating matters is the fact that diabetic patients are already at risk for NAION and other eye issues, making it challenging to isolate Ozempic as the direct cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a 2024 &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2820255" class=" staff-link"&gt;JAMA Ophthalmology&lt;/a&gt; study found that diabetic patients on semaglutide were over four times more likely to develop NAION than those on alternative treatments. The risk was even greater among overweight users, a key demographic for Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Person with red nail polish standing on a scale measuring weight, related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce18917eb__880" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?image_id=Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce18917eb__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Ozempic Lawsuit: Everything You Need To Know About The Latest Vision Loss Allegations" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?media_id=Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce18917eb__880" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce18917eb__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce18917eb__880.jpg" alt="Person with red nail polish standing on a scale measuring weight, related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss concerns." title="Person with red nail polish standing on a scale measuring weight, related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss concerns." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/an-anonymous-woman-on-the-scales-before-her-weight-loss-news-photo/141598984?adppopup=true" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Tina Stallard / Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the authors emphasized that the data showed correlation, not causation, their work supported early plaintiff claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_middle_1" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A follow-up study in 2025 echoed these findings, noting an uptick in vision-related complications among Ozempic users, even those without prior eye problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then in August 2025, the &lt;a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/prac-concludes-eye-condition-naion-very-rare-side-effect-semaglutide-medicines-ozempic-rybelsus-wegovy" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;European Medicines Agency&lt;/a&gt; officially listed NAION as a “very rare” side effect of semaglutide. According to the agency, it may affect up to 1 in 10,000 users after a year on the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a regulatory body confirms what plaintiffs are alleging, it significantly strengthens their case. The EMA also urged patients to seek medical attention immediately if they notice sudden vision changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical experts caution that more research is needed before drawing definitive conclusions. However, with growing evidence and regulatory acknowledgment, there is already considerable support for the ongoing mass tort litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How the Legal Battle Is Evolving&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;Most Ozempic-related cases fall under &lt;a href="https://www.paed.uscourts.gov/mdl/mdl-3094-re-glucagon-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-glp-1-ras-products-liability-litigation" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;MDL 3094&lt;/a&gt;, a multidistrict litigation focused on GLP-1 agonists. The core allegation is that Novo Nordisk failed to warn doctors and patients about the drug’s severe risks, including permanent vision loss and stomach paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, Novo Nordisk is expected to invoke long-standing legal doctrines that often shield pharmaceutical companies. One is the “learned intermediary doctrine,” which holds that the company’s duty is fulfilled once it warns the prescribing physician. The burden then shifts to the doctor to relay those risks to the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another likely defense is preemption. The &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/preemption" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cornell Law School Legal Information Institute&lt;/a&gt; explains this as the idea that federal law, like the FDA’s approval process, can override state-level failure-to-warn claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Law firms like Morgan &amp;amp; Morgan, Motley Rice, and Seeger Weiss are leading the charge for plaintiffs. Each firm has a seat on the Plaintiffs’ Leadership Committee and is responsible for proving injury and showing Novo Nordisk knowingly withheld crucial safety information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the MDL, some of the most serious NAION cases have been filed in &lt;a href="https://www.njcourts.gov/notices/notice-multicounty-litigation-application-new-jersey-state-court-litigation-alleging-use-of" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;New Jersey state court&lt;/a&gt;, where Novo Nordisk is headquartered. This legal strategy could invoke state consumer protection laws and create a more favorable path for plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All signs point to a long, high-stakes legal showdown that could reshape pharmaceutical accountability rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Are the Stakes?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk faces more than mounting legal fees. Its reputation and financial future may be on the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early projections from &lt;a href="https://www.business-standard.com/health/ozempic-lawsuits-weight-loss-side-effects-stomach-paralysis-vision-loss-125081900853_1.html" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Business Standard&lt;/a&gt; estimate that total payouts from the Ozempic lawsuits could exceed $2 billion. This figure factors in the severity of the injuries, long-term medical costs, lost income, and damages for pain and suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The introduction of permanent vision loss into the litigation significantly raises the stakes. These NAION cases are now expected to serve as “bellwether” trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://clp.law.stanford.edu/bellwether-trials/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Stanford University &lt;/a&gt;explains, bellwether trials are early cases used to gauge how juries might respond to evidence and arguments. A single major verdict favoring a NAION plaintiff could sharply increase Novo Nordisk’s overall liability and shape the size of future settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the outcome of these early NAION cases could determine the trajectory of the entire litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pharmaceutical Industry Is Responding to Mounting Pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facing billions in potential liability, Novo Nordisk is rolling out a multifaceted strategy to defend itself. The company continues to deny any wrongdoing, maintaining that its GLP-1 drugs are safe when used as prescribed and already carry adequate warnings for known side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk has also launched a quiet media push. &lt;a href="https://www.business-standard.com/health/ozempic-lawsuits-weight-loss-side-effects-stomach-paralysis-vision-loss-125081900853_1.html" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Business Standard&lt;/a&gt; reports the company is emphasizing that the off-label weight loss boom was driven by social media, exposing users to risks not accounted for in the drug’s intended use. In other words, many injuries may stem from misuse, not manufacturer failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.novonordisk.com/sustainable-business/esg-portal/principles-positions-and-policies/illicit-compounding-position.html" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Novo Nordisk&lt;/a&gt; is cracking down on compounding pharmacies and telehealth clinics that sell unauthorized versions of its medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_0" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/novo-nordisk-files-14-lawsuits-unapproved-semaglutide-drugs/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Pharmaceutical Technology&lt;/a&gt;, the company has filed over 132 lawsuits across 40 states and secured at least 44 permanent injunctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="video-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These legal moves serve two goals: tackling a public health risk and casting the company as a defender of drug safety. Novo Nordisk has also ramped public education efforts to warn against unsafe compounded products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, these actions suggest the company may argue that any harm plaintiffs suffered came not from its FDA-approved drugs, but from unregulated alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Broader Conversation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;Ozempic’s transformation from a niche diabetes treatment to a cultural phenomenon has sparked wider debates about beauty standards, off-label drug use, and pharmaceutical ethics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before and after weight loss comparison image related to Ozempic lawsuit vision loss allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce7033a4d__880" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?image_id=Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce7033a4d__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Ozempic Lawsuit: Everything You Need To Know About The Latest Vision Loss Allegations" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?media_id=Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce7033a4d__880" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce7033a4d__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce7033a4d__880.jpg" alt="Before and after weight loss comparison image related to Ozempic lawsuit vision loss allegations." title="Before and after weight loss comparison image related to Ozempic lawsuit vision loss allegations." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/progresspics/comments/yeythw/f3952_195155140_lbs_cico_and_ozempic_no_exercise/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;r/progresspics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug’s popularity exploded as influencers and celebrities flooded social media with dramatic before-and-after shots, often touting effortless weight loss without the need for exercise or diet changes. &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/celebrities-before-and-after-ozempic/" class=" staff-link"&gt;Celebrity transformations&lt;/a&gt; helped feed the frenzy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This viral demand extended far beyond Ozempic’s approved use, exposing a wider and more diverse population to potential side effects and setting the stage for today’s lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise of Ozempic also fits into a larger shift around injectables and cosmetic trends, including procedures like the &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/lip-flip-before-and-after/" class=" staff-link"&gt;lip flip&lt;/a&gt; and transformations seen in figures like &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/kimberly-guilfoyle-before-and-after/" class=" staff-link"&gt;Kimberly Guilfoyle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, weight loss isn’t just aesthetic.

The 62-year-old singer — who fronted &lt;b&gt;MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; more than two and a half decades ago — said (as transcribed by &lt;b&gt;BLABBERMOUTH.NET&lt;/b&gt;): "Yeah. I'm so lucky, really. With heart disease, it's one of those things, it creeps up on you. You just feel a bit out of breath here, and things are a bit more of a struggle there, and you don't really start thinking too much about it, but it adds up over time and suddenly you're having a heart attack. It's, like, how did this happen?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on his heart attack, &lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; said: "The main thing, at the hospital, I'd just got in. They put you in this amazing room where they can X-ray you and look at all these things while other people are in the room and everything, and look at all. And they're looking at it and go, 'No, it's not stents. It's gonna need surgery. No, we can't do anything for you here. Put you out on the ward. You wait for the surgeon.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had a quadruple bypass, and I've made a good recovery," he continued. "I had a little hiccup in my recovery because when I got well enough to exercise and it was safe to exercise, I had a knee injury, and that put me back about five months, really. But, yeah, apart from that, I've got my strength back now, and I've made a good recovery. They discovered that I did have an abnormal heart in that the left side was smaller and somehow it wasn't working the best. And so the right side had been taking up the strain. And they said, with the new plumbing, I might feel an advantage. And I do — compared to what I was before, I've got a lot more energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The worst part about it for me is the diet — trying to keep the weight off," &lt;b&gt;Bayley&lt;/b&gt; admitted. "I managed to lose a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of weight with changing my habits and no exercise &lt;i&gt;at all&lt;/i&gt;. I managed to lose 30 pounds with no exercise, just by eating sensible and the way that I should have been eating. Bad habits creep back, so I'm having to try again with that. But that's about it. I stopped drinking a while ago, and it was difficult in the beginning, but gradually it's less and less of a challenge over the years, and it was all right. And the diet, to try and stay healthy, it's much tougher to give up chocolate, sugar, biscuits, donuts, sausage rolls, pies — it's much tougher to give up that than to give up booze. I wasn't a raging alcoholic, but with my mental health, I'm, like, 'I've gotta stop drinking because I've drank enough. I'm old enough now. I don't really need another drink.' But then to stop eating pies and all these things — and I start feeling, 'Oh, I feel great now. My knees feel better. Everything feels better now. I've lost all this weight.' And then bit by bit, 'Oh, I'll just have that little treat.' And then, 'My God. I look just like I'm gonna have a heart attack. No!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's the worst thing — it's the diet, man. It's tough. And the food industry and Big Pharma [large, multinational pharmaceutical companies] are absolutely complicit in making us fat and giving us heart disease and strokes. Absolutely. They can sue me. Because it's absolutely true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The healthiest time in the U.K. was in World War II when people had to have rations, so there wasn't much food," &lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; added. "[People] were [at their] healthiest — less heart attack, strokes, less illness, less obesity, less everything. And then when we had — and this is the worst thing — they say, 'Oh, the best thing since sliced bread,' is an expression. Sliced bread is the worst thing. Bread made in a factory is one of the absolute worst things for our health, and they told us, 'Oh, it's the best thing?' No, it's the worst thing. Bread should be made by bakers early in the morning, not in a factory. Anyway, that's me. I had a heart attack and I feel it's partly their fault. I didn't know white bread was poisonous."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bayley&lt;/b&gt; fronted &lt;b&gt;IRON MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; from 1994 until 1999. The two &lt;b&gt;MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; albums he appeared on, &lt;b&gt;"The X Factor"&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;"Virtual XI"&lt;/b&gt;, sold considerably less than the band's prior releases and were their lowest-charting titles in the group's home country since 1981's &lt;b&gt;"Killers"&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since leaving &lt;b&gt;IRON MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; in 1999, &lt;b&gt;Bayley&lt;/b&gt; has released a number of albums, including several under the moniker &lt;b&gt;BLAZE&lt;/b&gt; and more than a handful under his own name. He also appeared on 2012's &lt;b&gt;"Wolfsbane Saves The World"&lt;/b&gt;, the first album of new material by &lt;b&gt;WOLFSBANE&lt;/b&gt; since the group's self-titled 1994 effort, and a follow-up LP, 2022's &lt;b&gt;"Genius"&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt;'s latest studio album, &lt;b&gt;"Circle Of Stone"&lt;/b&gt;, came out in February 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, &lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; told &lt;a href="https://www.themetalvoice.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Metal Voice&lt;/a&gt; about his heart attack: "There's so many lucky things about a terrible incident in my life. I'm at home on Saturday. On the Friday, I've just signed off on what I think is probably the final mastered mix of a new album. That's on a Friday. Here I am on a Saturday. On the Monday, I'm scheduled to go on tour in Europe to continue with &lt;b&gt;'The Man Who Would Not Die'&lt;/b&gt; tour. And there I am, and I've got chest pains, and I think, 'Oh, is this indigestion?' I'm having a heart attack. I live two minutes from the ambulance station. I'm on the phone, and apparently the paramedics, they were going on their break towards the ambulance station and they said, 'Oh, we heard that call. It's on our way. We'll take that call.' Two minutes, they're in my house. I've got wires on my chest. 'You're having a heart attack.' I live in the city, but I'm between four hospitals. In 15 minutes I'm having treatment, and they're injecting me with dye to see what the problems are and everything. So that's it. I'm safe. I'm in hospital 15 minutes later."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; continued: "They said, the paramedics, if that had been 10 minutes [later], there's no way you'd make it. So I was 10 minutes from death. I had a heart attack, not heart failure. They got to me in time. But if I'd have been somewhere else, if I'd have been in Eurotunnel, if I'd have been in a hotel room alone, or on the autobahn in Germany — anywhere, man… It's just terrifying, really, to think about where I could be. And when they said, 'Oh, you should be able to make it back,' I said, 'I've gotta get back to work. I can't leave it like this.' I've done an album called &lt;b&gt;'War Within Me'&lt;/b&gt;, and I haven't toured the whole thing. I'm thinking of my fans and everything. I thought, 'I can't leave it like this. I've still got more music to make. I've got things to say, and I don't wanna feel like I'm letting my fans down either.' So I was so focused."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bayley&lt;/b&gt; added: "It took a while — like a few weeks — before they could put me in for the surgery. It was a quadruple bypass. Basically, they cut you in half. They cut me in half, they do a load of plumbing and then they put you back together. And the guy said, 'We wired you back together with surgical steel wire.' He said, 'We've doubled wired.' I said, 'So even more metal?' Yeah, even more metal. So I've got more metal in me than a normal heart patient."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked what symptoms he experienced prior to suffering his heart attack, &lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; said: "It's different for everyone. And this is why it's so confusing. That's why I didn't know I was having a heart attack. My heart attack was a pain that starts — it's like someone sitting on your chest or being kicked by a horse in your chest in slow motion, and it goes from the front to the back and you're sweating and all of this. That's how it happened for me. That's common. The other thing that happens is, for some people — and I didn't have &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; of this — you start going numb, you start going tingly down your left arm and it spreads across you. That's another thing. And for other people, there are other symptoms. So you just don't know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding what steps other men can take toward reducing their chances of having a heart attack, &lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; said: "You've gotta try and head it off early by getting tested for your cholesterol, your triglycerides, and all of this. And just exercise is vital, and we just don't realize that. It's vital. I think chronic laziness is one of the things. You get out the van, you get on the stage, I'm active for a couple of hours, breathing all of that, hadn't been away for a while, hadn't done anything for a while. COVID, two years of not going out there all the time. And I think that a big combination of things, and some bad habits, that led up to something that was almost fatal, really."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2023, &lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; shared details of the massive outpouring of well-wishes he received after his heart attack, including messages from his former &lt;b&gt;MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; bandmates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The thing I feel most lucky about is the incredible support I've had from my fans," he told &lt;b&gt;BLABBERMOUTH.NET&lt;/b&gt;. "All over the world. My &lt;b&gt;WOLFSBANE&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Blaze Bayley&lt;/b&gt;, the &lt;b&gt;MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; fans. Everybody bought a t-shirt for a tour that was postponed. They still bought it to support me. I'm just incredibly lucky. And the letters people wrote to me. Hundreds of cards from all over the place. It's very humbling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; continued: "I've always put my whole life into music. It is my life. When people get in touch with you and say, 'I wish you well because your music has gotten me through tough times,' 'Your music meant this to me,' 'I first saw you way back when and it's been the soundtrack to my life,' it's incredible. I got a massive card from the &lt;b&gt;MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; fan club. The [&lt;b&gt;MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt;] guys all sent me a message. I'm always in touch with &lt;b&gt;Steve Harris&lt;/b&gt; [&lt;b&gt;MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; bassist] anyway, but everyone sent messages of support."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A heart bypass surgery, or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, is used to improve blood flow to the heart. A surgeon uses blood vessels taken from another area of the body to bypass the damaged arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term quadruple bypass refers to the number of coronary arteries bypassed in the procedure. In other words, a quadruple bypass means four coronary arteries are bypassed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Oppa3umPUY?si=Vo6xbKgxndniiskb" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BLABBERMOUTH.NET</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 18:36:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4wFBVV95cUxObE9tbk44OUFVX0pvQ3VOWVQtcEFQUXoyRXhSRWlSU1pYanRCdXdXWVdnTnlZdEh5OXI1VlMzWG9UR1dFYjJxUVV0azIwcW1VVnhQU2p6ZnoxelRGZ3dxeE9SRmM5STNzSFB1SzE1Z2pCaWVXZzh4dk1PaTdRTmlKeUdnNGpyU19DQmoydS0xRXlRUW9uOFZoeU9MRU1Lb2pDdDREUnZsVGdLZ3pfV1VNTVdabXRYMmhXTFpPQWRiZy0xX190T2hMTGUybHN2eVpmSDNiWjYzMURMUHpqd3hrNGNpWQ</guid></item><item><title>如果您每天只吃一个热狗，这种情况可能会发生在您的身体上- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/this-could-happen-to-your-body-if-you-eat-just-one-hot-dog-processed-meat-each-day/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study pooled results from dozens of prior investigations to test whether small, everyday portions of processed meat, sugary drinks, and industrial trans fats are tied to common diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis found that even modest daily intake is associated with higher risks of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-identify-a-cellular-switch-mitochondria-that-could-reverse-type-2-diabetes/"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, colorectal cancer, and ischemic heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The estimates were not huge, but they were consistent, and they appeared even at low levels of intake such as a single hot dog or a 12 ounce soda. The researchers emphasized how risk rose with more consumption across the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Demewoz-Haile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Demewoz Haile&lt;/a&gt; is a research scientist at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle (&lt;a href="https://www.healthdata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IHME&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-processed-meat-and-daily-habits"&gt;Processed meat and daily habits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts who were asked to weigh in stressed how steady habits add up over time, and they pointed to the reliability of the pattern across many datasets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Habitual consumption of even small amounts of processed meat, sugary drinks, and trans fatty acids is linked to increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/about-heart-attacks/silent-ischemia-and-ischemic-heart-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ischemic heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and colorectal cancer,” said Dr. Haile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another nutrition scientist urged people to limit these foods for the long haul rather than chase perfection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current research, consistent with earlier findings, indicates that the best way to improve health is to avoid or keep intake of processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, and industrially produced trans fats as low as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-study-was-done"&gt;How the study was done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used a Burden of Proof approach, a type of meta-analysis that models how risk changes across the full range of intake while grading the consistency of the evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most associations in this paper received two stars in that framework, which the authors describe as weak but still meaningful, with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/processed-meat-can-cause-health-issues-even-in-tiny-amounts/"&gt;hot dogs&lt;/a&gt; and other processed meat and ischemic heart disease receiving one star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dose response curves rose steadily, and they rose fastest at the low end of intake. That shape helps explain why small daily portions can move risk in population studies even if the per person effect looks modest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-counts-as-processed-meat"&gt;What counts as “processed meat”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processed meat includes products preserved by smoking, curing, salt, or chemical preservatives, such as hot dogs, bacon, sausages, and deli meats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processed meat is classified as carcinogenic to humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (&lt;a href="https://www.iarc.who.int/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Monographs-QA_Vol114.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IARC&lt;/a&gt;), with colorectal cancer as the main concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar sweetened beverages cover regular sodas, fruit drinks that are not 100 percent juice, energy drinks, sports drinks, and sweetened coffees and teas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 12 ounce can is a common serving, and that size showed measurable links with type 2 diabetes and ischemic heart disease in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-these-foods-may-harm-the-body"&gt;How these foods may harm the body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processed meats often contain nitrite that can form &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/nitrosamine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nitrosamines&lt;/a&gt;, compounds that can damage cells in the digestive tract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High heat cooking of meats can also produce polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic amines, which have been tied to tumor formation in prior lab and epidemiology work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar sweetened beverages deliver large amounts of rapidly absorbed sugar without much satiety, which drives excess calorie intake and strains insulin regulation over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industrial &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/junk-food-diet-triggers-lasting-changes-in-the-brain/"&gt;trans fatty&lt;/a&gt; acids raise LDL cholesterol and lower HDL cholesterol, a pattern known to promote plaque buildup in arteries and increase cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-evidence-shows"&gt;What the evidence shows&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observational data cannot prove causation, and dietary questionnaires can be imprecise, so caution is warranted when interpreting the size of the effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we look at the actual data there, it’s really remarkably consistent and remarkably strong, and even in the lower dose of consumption, we can still see an increased risk of disease,” said &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/mingyang-song/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Mingyang Song&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor of clinical epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (&lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;HSPH&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others reminded readers to avoid fear and to keep diet in perspective alongside activity, stress, and access to care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The limitations of recall based diet tools and differences in study design leave some uncertainty, but none of that erases the pattern that higher intake tracks with higher disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-processed-meat-and-human-health"&gt;Processed meat and human health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global guidance suggests keeping free sugars to less than 10 percent of daily calories and ideally closer to 5 percent, and that directly targets sugar sweetened drinks, as laid out in a World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241549028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;guideline&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, the Dietary Guidelines also advise limiting added sugars to under 10 percent of calories across the life span, a point detailed in the federal &lt;a href="https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/resources/2015-2020_dietary_guidelines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many countries are now removing industrial trans fats from the food supply, and the World Health Organization’s &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/nutrition-and-food-safety/replace-trans-fat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;REPLACE&lt;/a&gt; policy provides a template for doing it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means fewer packaged foods will contain partially hydrogenated oils, but checking labels remains wise because trace amounts can still show up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The goal shouldn’t be perfection but rather a healthy and sensible dietary pattern that allows room for enjoyment,” said &lt;a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/food/our-staff/gunter-kuhnle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Gunter Kuhnle&lt;/a&gt;, professor of nutrition and food science at the &lt;a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Reading&lt;/a&gt; in the United Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Progress does not require a perfect diet or a strict set of rules. Small, steady changes, like swapping a daily soda for water or seltzer and choosing unprocessed proteins more often, can bring intake closer to those targets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03775-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 16:24:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNTGdPU3BfUjZFZzhXc0VMTkRlTkxKdFVVNDdVZzNVeU1WSXhpUVFkNkFaMFdObDlTeFNDTGJUUVVSWktod3FMRm1SWjNtRnNDMEJ5aWk4QUNvSmFPX0VBQ2pYelZMU09vUmlaOHdxV0gyRjlKV0d1d0VPWEd2cUpfc29VME9GazMyUkQ2eV82R3BRTDJLOFpWVWRnUjJweHBfU3dkNkZzeGRYa0dCbHYw</guid></item><item><title>什么是日本间歇步行趋势，它真的能让您更健康吗？ -每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-15104251/What-Japanese-Interval-Walking-trend-really-make-you-fitter.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

                  &lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;     &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whereas once the ways of getting fit were quite straightforward – going to the gym, heading out for a run etc – nowadays there are all kinds of weird and wonderful workout ‘methods’ gaining traction on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/home/you/article-14102137/weighted-hula-hoop.html"&gt;weighted hula hoops&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/home/you/article-14559665/10-20-30-viral-exercise-hack.html"&gt;10-20-30 hack&lt;/a&gt;, the internet is constantly coming up with new ways to stay fit and healthy, and one of the recent exercise routines to trend online is called ‘Japanese Interval Walking’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you haven’t heard of it before, you are certainly not alone, but essentially it’s a form of intermittent walking developed by researchers in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/japan/index.html" id="mol-137549f0-9317-11f0-9c24-3b2c6714de30"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; to improve cardiovascular fitness and your metabolism. In practise, that means repeating the following five times, for a total of 30 minutes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;- Walk at a brisk pace for 3 minutes: About 70-85% of your maximum heart rate. You should be able to speak, but you may find continuous talking a challenge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;- Walk at a more leisurely pace for 3 minutes and let your heart rate come down to 40-50% of your maximum heart rate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And it’s not just an internet fad. The Japanese Walking Technique is supported by the research of Dr Hiroshi Nose published in &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0025619611613037"&gt;Mayo Clinic Proceedings.&lt;/a&gt; Compared to continuous walking at the same pace, the researchers found that ‘High-intensity interval walking may protect against age-associated increases in blood pressure and decreases in thigh muscle strength and peak aerobic capacity.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Japanese Interval Walking is the latest TikTok fitness method&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Intermittent walking is also an easy method to try out. Jack Claxton, Personal Trainer at&lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.davidlloyd.co.uk/"&gt; David Lloyd&lt;/a&gt; says ‘switching between a brisk pace and a steadier one’ when you walk ‘is a great way to get more out of something most people already do every day. It gives your heart and lungs a stronger workout, helps you burn more calories in less time, and boosts stamina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Interval training in general also makes exercise more engaging because the change of pace keeps it varied and less monotonous,’ he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But how do you know what counts as high intensity walking? Well, your maximum heart rate can be estimated by subtracting your age from 220. If you are walking with a heart rate at around three-quarters of this number, as measured on a fitness tracker (e.g. a fitness watch), then that’s a good sign, but as Claxton says ‘A simple way to measure this is the “talk test.” If you’re walking quickly enough that you’re breathing heavily and can only speak in short sentences, that’s considered high intensity for you.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Your maximum heart rate is 220 minus your age - aim to be at 70-85% of this number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are ways to achieve this other than simply walking very fast. ‘Walking uphill, or using an incline on a treadmill, is another way to increase intensity without running,’ says Claxton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although it can count as high-intensity, walking is also low impact, making it much gentler on the joints and more sustainable for most people, especially those who are older or recovering from an injury. ‘It’s also one of the most accessible forms of exercise because it requires no equipment and can easily be built into daily life,’ says Claxton. ‘On top of that, it’s a great stress reliever and often easier to stick to long term compared to more demanding workouts like running or aerobics’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Walking is brilliant for relieving stress, says Claxton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, that doesn’t necessarily mean you should ditch other forms of workout in favour of walking. ‘While walking is excellent for cardiovascular health, it doesn’t build strength or improve mobility on its own,’ says Claxton. ‘As we age, resistance training becomes crucial for maintaining bone density, reducing the risk of falls, and preserving independence in daily activities. That’s why it’s so important to combine walking with some form of strength training; even simple bodyweight exercises or light weights can make a big difference.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for his verdict on social media fitness trends? They have pros and cons, says Claxton. ‘On the positive side, they can motivate people to try new workouts and become more active, which is always a good thing. However, not everything you see online is safe, effective, or suitable for everyone. Many of these trends are designed more to capture attention than to genuinely improve health. My advice is to use TikTok as inspiration, but rely on proper guidance from a professional for your actual training.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Researchers point to rising skepticism toward medicine and Hispanic population growth as possible factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BALTIMORE —&lt;/strong&gt; Circumcision among newborn boys in the United States has steadily declined over the past decade, even as leading health organizations have voiced support for the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new analysis from researchers at Johns Hopkins University of more than 1.5 million annual hospital records shows the share of newborn boys circumcised during their first month of life fell from 54.1% in 2012 to 49.3% in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This decline came after the World Health Organization (2007), the American Academy of Pediatrics (2012), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2018) each issued &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/study-finds-circumcision-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;recommendations supporting access&lt;/a&gt; to newborn circumcision. These groups highlighted research linking the procedure with lower risks of urinary tract infections, penile inflammation, and transmission of sexually transmitted infections including HIV.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-white-families-account-for-the-largest-circumcision-decline"&gt;White Families Account for the Largest Circumcision Decline&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trends varied sharply across racial and ethnic groups. For White newborns, circumcision prevalence was 61.0% in 2012, rose to a peak of 65.3% in 2019, and then declined to 60.0% in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Black families maintained the highest rates at about 66% throughout the study period, while Hispanic families consistently had the lowest at around 21%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regional differences were just as pronounced. Hospitals in the Midwest recorded the highest prevalence at 68.5% in 2022, while Western hospitals reported only 19.7%. Among White families in the West, circumcision dropped from 34.3% in 2012 to 26.2% in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wealth-and-insurance-status-shape-decisions"&gt;Wealth and Insurance Status Shape Decisions&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/income/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Household income&lt;/a&gt; and insurance coverage also influenced circumcision choices. Parents in the wealthiest zip codes started with higher rates (59.4% in 2012) but saw some of the steepest declines, falling to 51.1% by 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Insurance patterns told a similar story. Families with private coverage had the highest baseline prevalence, 64.2% in 2012, yet their rate fell sharply to 56.3% in 2022. Medicaid-covered families showed smaller shifts, with circumcision declining from 44.5% to 42.3% over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Policy changes may have contributed. By 2011, 17 states had ended &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/medicaid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Medicaid coverage&lt;/a&gt; for routine newborn circumcision, creating financial hurdles for some families. Still, researchers noted that cost alone cannot explain the overall decline, since reductions were also seen among privately insured families.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cultural-factors-and-changing-attitudes-towards-circumcision"&gt;Cultural Factors and Changing Attitudes Towards Circumcision&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors note that several factors may contribute to why parents are choosing circumcision less often despite medical endorsements. The American Academy of Pediatrics affirms that the health benefits outweigh the risks but stresses that the decision should remain &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/parenting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;with parents&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They highlight increased skepticism toward medical recommendations in the United States and the continual growth of the Hispanic population and births, given that Hispanic families have consistently low circumcision rates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2025.2464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;JAMA Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, also found that rates among Black newborns stayed stable across regions, while White newborns showed the largest decreases. The authors did not investigate reasons for these racial differences, only documenting their persistence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-medical-guidance-meets-parental-autonomy"&gt;Medical Guidance Meets Parental Autonomy&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers relied on the Kids’ Inpatient Database, a nationally representative sample of pediatric hospitalizations. They examined circumcision procedures performed within 28 days of birth, identified through billing codes. This design captures most newborn circumcisions, though not those performed in outpatient clinics or later in infancy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Limitations include possible underreporting due to coding sensitivity, lack of state-level identifiers, and the fact that the database counts hospital discharges rather than unique infants. Still, the study represents the most comprehensive national picture available.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between 2012 and 2022, medical organizations offered some of their clearest endorsements of circumcision’s health benefits. Yet parents moved in the opposite direction, choosing the procedure less often. The gap between institutional recommendations and family decisions underscores how health behaviors reflect more than clinical guidance alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the authors concluded, circumcision trends reflect a mix of demographic change, cultural views, and shifting trust in healthcare—factors that shape decisions even when medical benefits are emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: This article is for general information only and should not be taken as medical advice. Parents should consult healthcare professionals when making decisions about circumcision or other procedures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed the Kids’ Inpatient Database from 2012 to 2022, examining over 1.5 million hospital records of male newborns aged 0-28 days each year. They excluded babies with bleeding disorders, penile abnormalities, or premature births. The team used medical billing codes to identify circumcision procedures and applied statistical weights to generate national estimates. They calculated annual circumcision rates and used regression analysis to measure changes over time across different demographic groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall circumcision rates declined from 54.1% in 2012 to 49.3% in 2022. White families drove most of the decline, with rates dropping from 65.3% to 60%. Black families maintained stable rates around 66%, while Hispanic families remained at about 21%. The Midwest had the highest rates (68.5%) and the West the lowest (19.7%). Wealthier families and those with private insurance had higher circumcision rates but experienced the largest declines during the study period.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study only captured hospital-based circumcisions using billing codes, which may underestimate total circumcision rates due to coding issues or outpatient procedures. The database tracks hospital discharges rather than individual patients, so multiple hospitalizations for the same baby appear as separate records. State-level data wasn’t available, limiting analysis of policy effects. The study was restricted to the first 28 days of life, potentially missing some procedures performed later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-funding-and-disclosures"&gt;Funding and Disclosures&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study received partial funding from a National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases grant (R01DK131926). Dr. Tobian reported receiving National Institutes of Health grants during the study. The researchers stated that funders had no role in study design, data analysis, or publication decisions. No other conflicts of interest were reported.&lt;/p&gt;

The study was conducted by researchers from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Bloomberg School of Public Health, led by Ping Yang and Dr. Aaron A.R. Tobian. The paper was accepted for publication on June 10, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

To paraphrase Hume: Just because two things happen at the same time doesn’t mean one is causing the other. Every smart person already already knows this, and it's repeated constantly, but we all still get it wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last &lt;a href="https://www.nutraingredients.com/Article/2025/07/31/correlation-dressed-up-as-causation-the-reality-of-microbiome-science/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;20 years of research on "gut biomes"&lt;/a&gt; could be wrong, partly as a result of both scientists and the media mistaking correlation and causation. (I've always had a gut feeling—get it?—this research was suspect.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years people believed that drinking alcohol in moderation is good for your health. But it isn't. It's &lt;em&gt;correlated&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9653126/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;better health in some populations&lt;/a&gt;, but it doesn't &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; better health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defenders of mistaken beliefs derived from the correlation/causation fallacy will often compile volumes of data that shows a nearly exact correlations between, say, higher rates of autism and higher rates of vaccination, which makes it totally understandable to believe one causes the other. But there's &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24814559/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;no evidence that vaccines cause autism&lt;/a&gt;, and the correlation is probably because children received vaccines around the age autism is generally diagnosed, and we've gotten better at both vaccinating children and diagnosing autism. But "probably" is doing some lifting in that sentence. While no causal link between vaccines and autism has ever been demonstrated, there could be any number of reasons the rates line up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classic debunking examples of correlation and causation, like the link between &lt;a href="https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2025/06/17/glp-spaces-on-x-ice-cream-sales-increase-drowning-confusing-correlation-and-causation-yields-strange-and-often-harmful-results" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;ice cream sales and shark attacks&lt;/a&gt;, tend to offer a pat explanation for the causal link—it only seems like ice cream causes shark attacks because both ice cream sales and swimming in the ocean rise when the weather is warmer—but even that is potentially mistaking correlation for causation. It makes sense, but we don’t actually &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; why those two numbers line up. And sometimes there just isn't any reason for connection between two pieces of disparate information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check out the chart below. It's &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt; that the ratings of &lt;em&gt;Two and Half Men&lt;/em&gt; directly correlates with the amount of jet fuel used in Serbia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="eloquent-imagery-image"&gt;

                    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made the second example on Tyler Vigen's &lt;a href="https://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Spurious Correlations&lt;/a&gt;, with a tool that will lets you &lt;a href="https://tylervigen.com/spurious/discover" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;make random connections all day.&lt;/a&gt; Not only that, the site uses AI to generate &lt;a href="https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious/research-papers/2700_fueling-laughter-exploring-the-comedic-connection-between-two-and-a-half-men-season-ratings-and-jet-fuel-consumption-in-serbia.pdf" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;bogus "research papers&lt;/a&gt;" to explain the connection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of the cats, ChatGPT offers this as a possible explanation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Health-conscious households (those that track diet, buy fruit, etc.) are more likely to treat even minor injuries cautiously. A person who eats more fruit is not more likely to be scratched, but they are more likely to Google 'my cat scratched me' to check for infection risks or treatment steps."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though I know it's bullshit, it &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;tracks&lt;/em&gt;. That's why we can never really stop being wrong in this specific way. Our brains &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to believe. A neatly phrased explanation, a tidy chart, a plausible-sounding theory—it's so &lt;em&gt;satisfying&lt;/em&gt;.  A simple "we don't know" can't hold a candle to that certainty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mistaking correlation for causation makes us go on fad diets and believe we're being healthy by drinking wine at dinner. It shapes health advice, public policy, and personal decisions in ways that can actually hurt people. The best we can do is try to be aware of it—when we read a headline that says "X causes Y," to assume this is a "cat scratches cause fruit consumption" situation until there's evidence that it isn't. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/article&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Cats may have a reputation for independence, but emerging research suggests we share a unique connection with them – fueled by brain chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main chemical involved is oxytocin, often called the love hormone. It's the same neurochemical that surges when a mother cradles her baby or when friends hug, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03701"&gt;fostering trust and affection&lt;/a&gt;. And now studies are showing oxytocin is important for cat-human bonding too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin plays a central role in social bonding, trust and stress regulation in many animals, including humans. One &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03701"&gt;2005 experiment&lt;/a&gt; showed that oxytocin made human volunteers significantly more willing to trust others in financial games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-a-simple-technique-to-communicate-with-your-cat"&gt;Scientists Reveal a Simple Technique to Communicate With Your Cat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174376" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174376" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/WomanScratchingClosedEyedCatsFace.jpg" alt="Scans Reveal Owning a Cat Changes Your Brain (And Theirs)" class="wp-image-174376 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/WomanScratchingClosedEyedCatsFace.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/WomanScratchingClosedEyedCatsFace-600x379.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174376" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Snuggling with a cat can help suppress the stress hormone cortisol.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;(Tatiana Lavrova/Moment/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin also has calming effects in humans and animals, as it suppresses the stress hormone cortisol and activates the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/our-vagus-nerves-help-us-rest-digest-and-restore-can-you-really-reset-them-to-feel-better-210469"&gt;parasympathetic nervous system&lt;/a&gt; (the rest and digest system) to help the body &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/13/13/2116#:%7E:text=Two%20stress%20response%20pathways%20to,and%20these%20effects"&gt;relax&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long known that friendly interactions &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93922-1"&gt;trigger oxytocin release&lt;/a&gt; in both dogs and their owners, creating a mutual &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/your-dog-can-read-your-mind-sort-of-261720"&gt;feedback loop of bonding&lt;/a&gt;. Until recently, though, not much was known about its effect in cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cats are more subtle in showing affection. Yet their owners often report the same warm feelings of companionship and stress relief that dog owners do – and studies are increasingly backing these reports up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Japan, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/13/13/2116#:%7E:text=Daily%20direct%20interaction%20with%20cats,physiological%20stress%20in%20their%20owners"&gt;reported in 2021&lt;/a&gt; that brief petting sessions with their cats boosted oxytocin levels in many owners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that study, women interacted with their cats for a few minutes while scientists measured the owners' hormone levels. The results suggested that friendly contact (stroking the cat, talking in a gentle tone) was linked to elevated oxytocin in the humans' saliva, compared with a quiet resting period without their cat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people find petting a purring cat is soothing, and research indicates it's not just because of the soft fur. The act of petting and even the sound of purring can trigger oxytocin release in our brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5aa6be7de17ba3f559d28f25/t/5aa85bc7e2c4839970ff3190/1520982983501/pet_paper.pdf"&gt;One 2002 study&lt;/a&gt; found this oxytocin rush from gentle cat contact helps lower cortisol (our stress hormone), which in turn can reduce blood pressure and even pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_147487" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-147487" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/GreenEyesOfCatPeakingOverFluffyObject.jpg" alt="Green cat eyes peaking over fluffy object" class="wp-image-147487 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/GreenEyesOfCatPeakingOverFluffyObject.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/GreenEyesOfCatPeakingOverFluffyObject-603x415.jpg 603w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/GreenEyesOfCatPeakingOverFluffyObject-600x413.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-147487" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/brown-tabby-cat-lying-on-white-textile-L9_6aQAUu-4"&gt;axholmephotography/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When is oxytocin released between cats and humans?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research is pinpointing specific moments that cause the release of this hormone in our cross-species friendship. Gentle physical contact seems to be a prime trigger for cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016815912500022X"&gt;A February 2025 study &lt;/a&gt; found that when owners engaged in relaxed petting, cuddling or cradling of their cats, the owners' oxytocin tended to rise, and so did the cats' – if the interaction was not forced on the animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers monitored oxytocin in cats during 15 minutes of play and cuddling at home with their owner. Securely attached cats who initiated contact such as lap-sitting or nudging showed an oxytocin surge. The more time they spent close to their humans, the greater the boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about less-cuddly felines? The same study noted different patterns in cats with more anxious or aloof attachment styles. Avoidant cats (those who kept their distance) showed no significant oxytocin change, while cats who were anxious (constantly seeking their owner but easily overwhelmed by handling) had high oxytocin to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin of avoidant and anxious cats was found to drop after a forced cuddle. When interactions respect the cat's comfort, the oxytocin flows – but when a cat feels cornered, the bonding hormone is elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe humans could learn something from their feline friends on managing attachment styles. The key to bonding with a cat is understanding how they communicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike dogs, cats don't rely on prolonged eye contact to bond. Instead, they use more understated signals. The most well known is the slow blink. It's a feline smile, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73426-0"&gt;signaling safety&lt;/a&gt; and trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purring also plays a role in bonding with people. The low-frequency rumble of a cat's purr has been linked not only to healing in cats themselves, but also to &lt;a href="https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/10.1079/hai.2021.0006"&gt;calming effects in humans&lt;/a&gt;. Listening to purring can lower heart rate and blood pressure; oxytocin &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10340037/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;mediates these benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companionship of a cat, reinforced by all those &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/13/13/2116#:%7E:text=Kamimura%2C%20I,Green"&gt;little oxytocin boosts&lt;/a&gt; from daily interactions, can serve as a buffer against anxiety and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="174360" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2752/089279393787002385"&gt;in some cases&lt;/a&gt; providing comfort on par with human social support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_115183" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-115183" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/12/BlackCatStoopedLowReadyToPounce.jpg" alt="Black cat crouching to pounce on toy" class="wp-image-115183 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/12/BlackCatStoopedLowReadyToPounce.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/12/BlackCatStoopedLowReadyToPounce-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/12/BlackCatStoopedLowReadyToPounce-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/12/BlackCatStoopedLowReadyToPounce-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/12/BlackCatStoopedLowReadyToPounce-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-115183" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Like dogs, many catch will play fetch. (scaliger/iStock/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are cats just less loving than dogs?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's true that studies generally find stronger oxytocin responses in dog–human interactions. In &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/research-dogs-actually-love-their-owners-more-than-cats-do/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;one widely discussed 2016 experiment&lt;/a&gt;, scientists measured oxytocin in pets and owners before and after ten minutes of play. Dogs showed an average 57 percent spike in oxytocin levels after playtime, whereas cats showed about a 12 percent increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In humans, oxytocin levels rise during meaningful social interactions. &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00532/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; show that contact with a loved one produces stronger oxytocin responses than contact with strangers. So, a happy dog greeting is akin to that rush of seeing your child or partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogs, being pack animals domesticated for constant human companionship, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)00602-3"&gt;are almost hard-wired&lt;/a&gt; to seek eye contact, petting, and approval from us – behavior that stimulates oxytocin release in both parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cats, however, evolved from more &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168159124000169"&gt;solitary hunters&lt;/a&gt; which didn't need overt social gestures to survive. So, they may not display oxytocin-fueled behavior as readily or consistently. Instead, cats may reserve their oxytocin-releasing behavior for when they truly feel safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cat's trust isn't automatic; it must be earned. But once given, it is reinforced by the same chemical that bonds human parents, partners, and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, next time your cat blinks slowly from across the sofa or climbs on to your lap for a purr-filled cuddle, know that something invisible is happening too: oxytocin is rising in both your brains, deepening the trust and soothing the stress of daily life. Cats, in their own way, have tapped into the ancient biology of love.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264396/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;There's a particular quality some older people have—a spark that makes you forget you're talking to someone who remembers when television was new. They drop perfectly timed jokes, recall obscure facts with startling clarity, and somehow manage to stay current without trying too hard. These aren't just the genetically blessed. They're people who've figured out that staying mentally sharp isn't about sudoku puzzles and crosswords alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between those who remain vibrant conversationalists at 75 and those who retreat into repetitive stories isn't luck. It's a collection of habits, attitudes, and deliberate choices that keep their minds flexible while their joints might not be. These rules aren't complicated or expensive—they're accessible to anyone willing to rethink what aging means for the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They treat curiosity like oxygen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharpest septuagenarians approach new information like they're still 25 and figuring out the world. They ask follow-up questions about your job, genuinely want to understand cryptocurrency, and aren't afraid to admit when something confuses them. This isn't politeness—it's intellectual survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiosity prevents the mind from calcifying around old assumptions. When you stop asking "why" and "how," your brain stops building new neural pathways. The mentally agile elderly understand that learning isn't just for the young—it's what keeps you young. They read books outside their comfort zone, watch documentaries about subjects they know nothing about, and aren't embarrassed to be beginners at something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They collect experiences, not just memories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a difference between having stories and having the same story. Sharp older adults keep adding chapters to their lives instead of just rereading the old ones. They try the new restaurant, take the unfamiliar route, say yes to invitations that younger them might have declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't about bungee jumping at 80. It's about maintaining &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2023.1232670/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cognitive flexibility&lt;/a&gt;—the ability to adapt thinking to new situations. Every new experience forces the brain to create fresh connections. The mentally vibrant understand that routine might be comfortable, but variation is what keeps neurons firing. They know that the phrase "I've never tried that before" should never fully leave your vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They embrace technology without surrendering to it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wittiest older adults have smartphones and know how to use them, but they're not enslaved by them. They've learned enough technology to stay connected and informed without letting it overwhelm their identity or dominate their time. They text their grandkids, share memes that actually land, and can navigate streaming services without assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's the key: they use technology as a tool, not a crutch. They understand that digital engagement opens doors to information and connection, but they don't mistake online interaction for real relationships. They've found the sweet spot between being a Luddite and being lost in the digital world. Their social media posts are coherent, but they also don't live for likes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They maintain friendships across generations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart 70-somethings don't just hang out with other 70-somethings. They cultivate friendships across age groups, not as mentors or authority figures, but as genuine peers. They have coffee with 40-year-olds, debate politics with 30-year-olds, and aren't threatened by 20-year-olds who know things they don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cross-generational mixing prevents the echo chamber effect that can make older adults feel disconnected from contemporary life. Younger friends bring fresh perspectives, new vocabulary, and different problems to solve. Research shows that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568163721001471" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;intergenerational connections&lt;/a&gt; can improve cognitive function and social well-being. The mentally sharp elderly understand these friendships aren't about feeling young—they're about staying relevant and engaged with the world as it actually is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They laugh at themselves first&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quickest wit often belongs to those who've learned not to take themselves too seriously. They'll joke about their "senior moments," their technological struggles, their creaking joints—but never in a self-pitying way. They've weaponized self-deprecation as a form of connection, not defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This humor serves a deeper purpose than just getting laughs. Self-directed humor is actually a sophisticated cognitive function that requires perspective-taking and emotional regulation. When you can laugh at your own limitations, you're demonstrating mental flexibility and resilience. The sharpest seniors know that taking yourself too seriously is the fastest way to become a caricature of old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. They read like their brain depends on it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just newspapers or their favorite genre—they read widely, voraciously, and challengingly. Fiction, non-fiction, long-form journalism, even the occasional graphic novel. They treat reading not as a pastime but as cognitive maintenance, each book a different exercise for different mental muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is variety. Reading only political books that confirm your views is like only doing bicep curls at the gym. The mentally sharp mix it up: a mystery novel followed by a history of jazz, a memoir paired with science writing. They understand that every new author's voice, every unfamiliar subject, forces the brain to work harder, stay more agile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. They pick their battles and forget the rest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp seniors have learned what's worth arguing about and what isn't. They'll engage in spirited debates about things that matter but won't waste energy correcting every wrong opinion or fighting every slight. They've developed what might be called selective passion—intense when it counts, relaxed when it doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't apathy; it's wisdom. It requires the prefrontal cortex to override the emotional brain's need to be right all the time. Those who stay sharp understand that mental energy is finite, and spending it on petty grievances leaves less for creativity, humor, and genuine connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. They stay physically active without being obsessive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharpest minds past 70 usually inhabit bodies that move regularly. Not marathon-running necessarily, but walking, swimming, gardening—something that gets blood flowing to the brain. They understand the brain-body connection isn't just wellness-speak; it's biological fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they're not fanatics. They don't bore you with their step count or lecture about their workout routine. They've found sustainable ways to stay active that feel more like living than exercising. Movement is integrated into life, not segregated into gym time. Research consistently shows that even moderate exercise can significantly improve cognitive function in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. They create more than they consume&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it's writing letters, cooking new recipes, woodworking, or watercolors, mentally sharp seniors are makers, not just takers. They produce something—anything—that didn't exist before they created it. This isn't about talent or skill; it's about the act of creation itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating requires the brain to work in ways that consuming never will. It demands problem-solving, planning, and adaptation when things don't go as expected. The act of creation, regardless of the medium, builds cognitive reserve—the brain's ability to maintain function despite age-related changes. Those who stay sharp understand that the question isn't "Am I good at this?" but "Am I engaged by this?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who remain quick-witted and mentally agile past 70 haven't discovered a secret formula or won a genetic lottery. They've simply refused to accept the narrative that aging means inevitable intellectual decline. They've chosen engagement over withdrawal, curiosity over certainty, growth over stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These rules aren't really rules at all—they're invitations to remain fully alive regardless of age. They recognize that the brain, like any muscle, responds to how you use it. The sharp seniors among us have figured out that wit isn't about being young; it's about being interested. They know that mental agility isn't about denying age; it's about embracing complexity at any age. Most importantly, they understand that staying sharp isn't just about cognitive exercise—it's about maintaining a fundamental belief that there's always something new to learn, someone interesting to meet, and something worth laughing about. Even—especially—yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s an old Babylonian/Biblical legal maxim that goes, “an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Canadian Brent Chapman, his new maxim is “a tooth for an eye,” because he has become the first in his country ever to receive an osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your Latin is on point, you’ll realize that translates to a tooth-in-eye prosthetic—literally Chapman’s tooth has been surgically implanted into his eye to act as a lens fixture which has enabled him to see again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s considered a last resort, and after 50 surgical transplants and procedures, that’s where Chapman was alongside his dedicated ophthalmological surgeon Dr. Greg Moloney, who has been putting Chapman under the knife since he was a teenager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now 34, Brent suffered a rare reaction to ibuprofen at age 13 that left severe burns on his cornea. The cornea acts like a windscreen, keeping debris and liquids out of the eyeball while allowing light to penetrate and reach the retina and optic nerve, but the burns permanently obscured the vision in his right eye while his left was lost entirely to infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tooth-in-eye surgery is rare; very rare—so rare that despite being pioneered in the 1960s Chapman’s procedure is the very first ever done in Canada. According to Dr. Moloney, it’s turned to when all other options have already been tried and failed, or the initial damage to the cornea is so substantial that ophthalmologists know there’s no chance conventional replacements or grafts will succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tooth is chosen because it’s made of the hardest material produced by the body. A hole is drilled through the canine tooth and a hi-tech lens is fitted inside. The tooth is then attached to the cheek through the eye, and an aperture to the retina and optic nerve is created so that the light can enter the lens and reach it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With glasses Chapman has about 20/30 vision, meaning at 20 feet he can see clearly what someone with perfect vision can see at 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Moloney &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/15/health/tooth-in-eye-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;spoke with CNN&lt;/a&gt; about the procedure, the bizarre sense in it, and the effect it has on people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The tooth is a really ideal structure for holding a focusing element in place. It’s hard, it’s rigid, it survives in poor environments, and the body accepts it because it’s part of its own,” said the corneal surgeon from the University of British Columbia. “It’s like watching people come out of a time capsule and reintroduce themselves to the world, it’s very emotional for us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapman agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s really indescribable, to be able to see the whole city and how there’s a whole world that’s just intersecting,” said the professional massage therapist, looking out at Vancouver from Moloney’s office on the 16th floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When you’re blind or low-vision, you’re not seeing that, and you’re kind of in your head more. There’s a lot more mental chatter, and it can be difficult. Dr. Moloney and I made eye contact for the first time, and we both got quite emotional. I haven’t really made eye contact in 20 years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s excited to see the faces of his beloved niece and nephew, 4 and 2, and also to return to a normal work schedule. He enjoys massage work because it means that he can help others who have pain, and give back, in a sense, for all the treatment he’s received over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He can’t wait to “not make everything about me,” go to Japan, and not have to worry about plans falling through or piling various medications and emergency contacts into his luggage and phone in case his vision fails again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was so unpredictable, I would make these plans, and it would be heartbreaking when I couldn’t do them,” he told CNN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block expert-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flu shots are now available at many pharmacies, doctors’ offices, and clinics around the country.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The vaccine is the most effective way to protect against severe illness and death from flu.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Despite the changes to COVID vaccine eligibility this year, the CDC and professional medical organizations still recommend everyone get the vaccine this fall.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Federal health agencies are expected to make substantial changes to vaccine guidance this fall. However, the flu vaccine recommendation remains the same: &lt;strong&gt;everyone older than 6 months should get an annual flu shot.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As many as 1.3 million Americans were hospitalized with the flu in the last flu season, and up to 130,000 people died from the disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The flu shot is both safe and life-saving&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; said &lt;a href="https://www.southnassau.org/sn/find-a-doctor/glatt-aaron-e-md-macp-fidsa-fshea-chair-department-26" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Aaron Glatt, MD&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the department of medicine and chief of infectious diseases at Mount Sinai South Nassau Hospital.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here’s what you need to know as you prepare for your flu shot this year.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/who-should-not-get-flu-shots-770429" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;no differences in who can get a flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt; this year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends it for all people ages 6 months or older, with rare exceptions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The CDC’s &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/fall-covid-vaccine-guide-11777880" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;changes to COVID-10 vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt; don’t apply to flu vaccines. The agency’s advisory panel is scheduled to meet in late September to discuss routine vaccines against COVID and other diseases, but not the flu vaccine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-when-should-you-get-the-flu-shot"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; When Should You Get the Flu Shot? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The vaccines are available now in many pharmacies, clinics, and doctors’ offices across the country. Flu cases typically pick up in October and peak in February, though that varies by year and region.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Glatt said it’s wise to get your flu shot sooner rather than later to ensure you’re protected when flu rears its head in your community. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;“You should have very good immunity in September that will last you through the flu season. Waiting until October isn't necessarily a dangerous thing if there's no flu around, but you probably want to have immunity when flu comes to your region,” Glatt said.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; He added that it's still worthwhile to get the flu shot even if you haven’t gotten one by the end of October. Flu circulates in most places until April, and it’s helpful to be protected through the winter and early spring. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-can-you-get-it-the-same-time-as-your-covid-shot"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Can You Get It the Same Time as Your COVID Shot? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since the COVID vaccines debuted in 2021, the CDC and medical groups have said that &lt;strong&gt;people can safely get the COVID and flu shots at the same time without diminishing their effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In a late August &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/188486/download" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;memo&lt;/a&gt;, the FDA’s top vaccine official said he “cannot affirm” that co-administering the vaccines is safe and effective and that the agency would start requiring vaccine makers to run clinical trials before making that claim.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.taskforce.org/employees/joe-bresee/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Joseph Bresee, MD&lt;/a&gt;, director of respiratory virus prevention and preparedness at The Task Force for Global Health, said that there is sound evidence that the practice is safe and people should feel comfortable getting their COVID and flu shots in the same visit while the FDA collects more data.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “More importantly, the ability to get vaccines together during the same visit creates an opportunity to expand the reach of these vaccines,” Bresee told Verywell. “If you make folks come back for one vaccine and then another vaccine in two weeks, you may lose some folks and miss the opportunity to get them vaccinated.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-much-will-the-flu-shot-cost"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Much Will the Flu Shot Cost? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If you have health insurance, the flu vaccine should be free to you.&lt;/strong&gt; Insurers are required to cover all vaccines recommended by the CDC’s advisory panel.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you are uninsured, the cost for a shot at a pharmacy could be as low as $20 or over $100. Many cities offer low- or no-cost vaccines to people without insurance at public health clinics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-can-you-get-a-nasal-spray-flu-vaccine-instead"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Can You Get a Nasal Spray Flu Vaccine Instead? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can now order the &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-the-nasal-flu-vaccine-flumist-770756" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;FluMist nasal spray vaccine&lt;/a&gt; to be delivered to your home.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This allows caretakers to give the vaccine or for people to self-administer without visiting a pharmacy or doctor’s office.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The nasal spray is safe and effective for people ages 2 to 49 years old who are not pregnant or immunocompromised.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It’s a nice option for people who have trouble getting to the doctor or the clinic, who are homebound for whatever reason,” Bresee said. “Many of those people are at higher risk for severe disease because they have underlying illnesses, and that's the reason they can't leave the house as easily.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-effective-is-the-flu-shot"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Effective Is the Flu Shot? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We won’t know exactly how effective this year’s flu vaccine is until around February.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s because the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/flu-vaccine-effectiveness-5211793" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;flu vaccine formula changes every year&lt;/a&gt; based on predictions from global health experts about which viral strains will circulate in the upcoming season. &lt;strong&gt;When the strains are well matched, the vaccine is usually between 40% and 60% effective at preventing severe illness and death from flu.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It's important to realize that getting the flu vaccine doesn't mean that you won't get the flu,” Glatt said. “Get vaccinated: if you do get the flu, you'll probably have a much milder episode. It certainly has been shown that it prevents hospitalizations, it prevents serious illness, and it prevents death.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The FDA recently expanded eligibility for the Flublok vaccine, a recombinant flu vaccine, to people as young as 9 years old.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Flublok uses a different technology than standard flu vaccines, which has been shown to be more effective in older adults. The CDC says all the options available for people younger than 65 are similarly effective.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-are-the-side-effects-of-the-flu-vaccine"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Are the Side Effects of the Flu Vaccine? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Flu vaccines are very, very safe vaccines. They've been given hundreds of millions of times over decades, and &lt;strong&gt;the most common side effects are locally sore arms or a little redness around for about 24 hours&lt;/strong&gt;,” Bresee said.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “&lt;strong&gt;Otherwise, they're very safe, and we shouldn't expect any new side effects popping up this year.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Anyone who has had significant allergic reactions to the flu or other vaccines in the past should talk to a health care provider before getting the shot. Otherwise, the vaccine is safe for just about everyone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Your doctor is your best source of information. He knows you. He knows your history,” Glatt said. “The CDC, professional society websites, and the Department of Health remain, at this point in time, excellent resources for information.”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block expert-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flu vaccine is the best way to protect against severe illness from influenza. To stay healthy and avoid getting others sick, make it a habit to wash your hands, cover your cough, stay home when you’re sick, and wear a mask if you’re contagious or worried about exposure. If you have flu, your doctor can prescribe you Tamiflu to help manage the symptoms.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

As a GP myself, I knew how serious my condition was,' she told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/burnout-relief-techniquest-longevity-alka-patel-rl5r2vrkg"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt; of her 2011 health scare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With three children and a successful but often stressful career, Dr Patel admitted that she never slowed down enough to notice the red-flag warning signs that she was about to crash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was rushed to hospital by her husband—Mandish, a dentist—after her temperature continued to climb past 38C, where she underwent emergency abdominal surgery, as doctors suspected an abscess in her abdomen could be to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But they found nothing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After being discharged following a month-long recovery stint in hospital, Dr Patel knew something needed to change, as it dawned on her that her resilience to stress after years of pushing the brink of burnout was to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now 14 years later, aged 53, Dr Patel has turned back the clock and has an impressive biological age—the age of her cells—of a 20-year-old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Alka Patel was hospitalised as her organs began to shut down before she hit reset—tracking everything from her blood sugar, sleep and heart rate to turn back her biological clock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Strange as it sounds, science shows we can bring our age down in measurable ways,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm proof of this. And while biohacking might bring to mind wealthy tech titans trying to live forever, many of the techniques I now tech clients as a longevity doctor are free, take minutes and can add decades to our lives.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Your biological age is not an ego-fuelled number—it's your health forecast. By dropping your biological age, we can liver longer, with less pain, more energy and agility and with fewer prescriptions.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Here the Daily Mail breaks down her daily routine, in which she prioritises sleep, diet and exercise for a longer, healthier life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;The power of a good routine &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite advising her patients to get the recommended 7-9 hours of sleep a night, Dr Patel rarely got more than four hours a night, working long after her children had gone to bed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But now, she has devised a night time routine that slows down ageing by allowing the body to repair cells, replenish depleted energy levels and clear toxic brain matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every night she sets an alarm for 9.30pm which signals her screen curfew, before she gets into bed an hour later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Patel discovered that her stress levels, which contribute to inflammation when raised, were not dropping low enough at night to allow for deep restorative sleep &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have long urged people to ditch screens before bed because the blue light they emit suppresses melatonin—a hormone produced naturally in the body that plays a crucial role in regulating the sleep-wake cycle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the evening, it can signal to your body that it's still time to be alert, throwing off your natural wind-down process. But, experts have also warned that forcing yourself to go to bed with nothing to occupy your mind, can also&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15054385/sleep-therapist-five-hacks-insomnia-WORSE.html"&gt; impact your sleep and fuel insomnia. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This hour in between switching off the TV and putting her phone on do not disturb creates the perfect wind-down window, promoting the production of melatonin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Book in hand, Dr Patel gets into bed calm and ready for a restorative 8 hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Morning &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Patel starts her morning with five stretches she holds for 50 seconds—including one that works on balance, such as calf raises—whilst brushing her teeth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A  study of 1,7000 people aged 50-75 found people who couldn't stand on one leg for at least 10 seconds had an 84 per cent increased risk of death after seven years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This forms a central part of Dr Patel's biohacking, in which she ranks her most-used hacks from 1-10, with a correlating activity or time, to make them easier to implement—showing that no matter how busy you are, you can always find 60 seconds to turn back the clock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Patel recommends habit stacking to implement her most-used biohacks into her routine. For example, whilst cleaning her teeth she will perform calf-raises to improve her balance (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the morning, she also practices her 1-10 hack which involves spending one minute in natural sunlight, followed by 10 seconds setting an intention for the day—with purpose being one of the key pillars of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15014419/Blue-Zone-UK-live-100-plymouth.html"&gt;blue zone centenarians. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is when she takes her first three sips of water, which she does every 30 minutes for the rest of the day—with one study finding those with lower fluid intake have a 21 per cent higher risk of dying early. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At 10am, Dr Patel has her first meal, restricting her eating to an eight-hour window to encourage autophagy—the medical term for cell repair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Midday &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After filling up on protein and fibre for lunch, Dr Patel goes for a walk or run followed by a quick dumbbell session, which she keeps under her desk at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This helps redirect blood glucose to the muscles, slashing the risk of diabetes by keeping blood sugar levels under control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also makes sure to switch up her posture, alternating between sitting and standing at her desk every 90 minutes to boost circulation and promote heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Patel keeps dumbbells under her standing desk at work which she uses every day after lunch to help keep blood sugar spikes under control &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Evening &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is when Dr Patel practices gratitude and reflects on her day, to lower stress and improve cognitive function—implementing seven seconds of silence every 70 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Paying compliments, meanwhile, is important because it releases the bonding hormone oxytocin,' she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oxytocin has been shown to affect the same centre of the brain as physical pain and may play a role in reducing inflammation and feelings of loneliness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is followed by an early dinner, giving the body enough time to finish digesting and before going to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eating too close to bed has long been linked to digestive issues, poor sleep and higher glucose spikes—all of which accelerate the ageing process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 11:47:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQS2NzMEhJT3JHRndMQVlVUEEtUHp1ODczd19BTFlEYzY4ZlRVai1fZzVjX2UtNlBQb1ZDVzNac0IxRnhHR2xvb05SZ0JmX1lWekhFbFprR2xlWEMtX1NaRS1SUEpueWNXWDUwUDUxQzEwZGNlUnZKTlVqWFlpVGgzanhqSzJYam5WRklKbnZzTmjSAZYBQVVfeXFMUFNPbFI2MmgyNVlLSGxMdkxKdzJaNzNvcHhyNEVWUWRmcTAxZWxoR3RucUJZQW1HbmR5S1Y0dmUtU214NlNJMWpKcU5GZGd1UjQ5a2JPWkk4S1lFS2s4XzFoREJJUGZSdElTVmp3blNFMzRmb29ZOHBJSzlwYlJsZFFzZkxyTVBmSFBnOXhwVnlTMGtPaEN3</guid></item><item><title>如果您剃发、剪发或拔发，您的头发会发生什么-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/09/16/cutting-shaving-plucking-waxing-hair-growth/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JMRLLMVJJJBTFL3GN4EBUEU22M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Does cutting or shaving hair make it grow back faster, darker or thicker?

&lt;div class="wp-block-cgb-lede"&gt;&lt;p class="lede-content hide"&gt;The advisory committee makes recommendations to the CDC on what vaccines the American public should take each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Monday named a Maui children’s physician who used unapproved drugs to treat Covid to serve on a powerful federal advisory panel on vaccine policy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kirk Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist and pastor at Calvary Chapel South Maui, provided the livestock drug ivermectin and the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to prevent and treat the coronavirus during free house calls for Maui residents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He and four others named Monday join the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html"&gt;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&lt;/a&gt; at a fraught moment in public health. In June, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restore-public-trust-vaccines-acip.html"&gt;fired all 17 sitting members of the panel&lt;/a&gt; that makes recommendations to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about how vaccines should be used, saying that a clean sweep is necessary to restore public trust in vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the health secretary’s picks have already been contentious, however. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ACIP member Robert Malone has been a vocal critic of Covid mRNA vaccines, blaming &lt;a href="https://x.com/RWMaloneMD/status/1908665463279677915"&gt;two deaths of unvaccinated children in the Texas measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; on “medical mismanagement” without citing any evidence. He and Milhoan are among several anti-vaccine voices on the panel.&lt;/p&gt;

(Cory Lum/Civil Beat/2021)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Hawaiʻi, Milhoan’s embrace of discredited Covid treatments has made him &lt;a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2021/08/from-masks-to-vaccines-how-churches-have-power-over-public-health/"&gt;a controversial figure&lt;/a&gt;. He did not require masks or social distancing at Calvary Church of South Maui during the height of the pandemic, saying the church’s mission must continue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His use of discredited drugs during the pandemic was &lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/news/newsroom/doh-statement-on-the-pono-coalition-for-informed-consent/"&gt;widely condemned&lt;/a&gt; by Hawaiʻi officials, including former Gov. David Ige and former Hawaiʻi Health Director Libby Char.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He and &lt;a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2021/08/that-is-not-aloha-dr-lorrin-pang-is-pushing-back-against-his-critics/"&gt;Dr. Lorrin Pang&lt;/a&gt;, the state’s top medical adviser for Maui County, co-founded The Pono Coalition for Informed Consent, a website that called the Covid vaccines experimental and advocated instead for the use of unproven drugs. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Hawaiʻi Medical Board filed a complaint against him and Pang in August 2021 that, if substantiated, could have led to the loss of their state medical licenses. The state Regulated Industries Complaints Office dropped the complaint eight months later and took &lt;a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/beat/state-drops-complaint-against-top-maui-medical-professional/"&gt;no disciplinary actions&lt;/a&gt; against them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More recently, Milhoan participated in &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/d41d8cd9/rep-marjorie-taylor-greene-leads-a-hearing-on-injuries-caused-by-covid-19-vaccin/6998956623513668/"&gt;a 2024 hearing&lt;/a&gt; hosted by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, a Republican from Georgia, on Covid-19 vaccine injuries. During the hearing he &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/discredited-covid-19-vaccine-skeptics-130000894.html"&gt;advocated against vaccinating children&lt;/a&gt;, alleging the Covid vaccine had triggered cardiac problems in some pediatric patients he’d seen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Milhoan and his wife operate &lt;a href="https://forheartsandsouls.org/who-we-are/"&gt;For Hearts and Souls&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit Christian medical ministry which provides medical care to children around the world with cardiac problems who lack access to treatment. He is a senior fellow at the &lt;a href="https://imahealth.org/"&gt;Independent Medical Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, a group formed in March 2020 that advocates for dubious Covid treatments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He has an active medical license in Hawai‘i, Montana, Wyoming and Texas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reached by email Monday, Milhoan, who traveled to Washington, D.C., for his appointment, declined to be interviewed. He cited a request made by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that all interviews be coordinated by the agency’s media team. The HHS media team did not respond to phone and email requests for comment or for an interview.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-revisiting-guidance"&gt;Revisiting Guidance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The newly configured panel is being convened as public trust in routine vaccines continues to decline nationally. One in six parents reported &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/"&gt;delaying or skipping at least one vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, other than Covid or the flu, for their children in a new KFF-Washington Post survey published Monday of more than 2,700 parents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next ACIP meeting is scheduled for Thursday and Friday, when the panel is expected to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-09-12-508.pdf"&gt;discuss vaccines against Covid&lt;/a&gt;, hepatitis B, measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, the virus that causes chickenpox. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As with flu shots, there are new Covid formulations each fall, to account for changes in which strains are circulating. The committee has not yet voted on whether to recommend this season’s Covid shots.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In June, Kennedy’s ACIP members suggested they wanted to revisit the guidance on Hepatitis B, which can cause serious liver infections. In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles during injection-drug use. The virus also can be passed to a baby from an infected mother, and as many as 90% of infected infants go on to have chronic infections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A hepatitis B vaccine was first licensed in the U.S. in 1981. In 2005, the ACIP recommended a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds. Infant vaccinations are stressed for women who have hepatitis B or who have not been tested for it. The infant shots are 85% to 95% effective in preventing chronic hepatitis B infections, studies have shown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Newborn hepatitis B vaccinations are considered a success, and no recent peer-reviewed research shows any safety problems with giving kids the shots on their first day of life, said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University vaccines expert.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The government first recommended that all children get a chickenpox vaccine in 1995, leading to a dramatic drop in cases and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chickenpox was once a common childhood annoyance, causing an itchy skin rash and fever. But the highly contagious virus can also lead to complications such as skin infections, swelling of the brain and pneumonia. Severe cases are more common among teens and adults who get it for the first time. The virus also can reactivate later in life and cause the painful illness called shingles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The other new panel members announced on Monday, bringing the total to 12, are Dr. Catherine Stein, an epidemiologist and professor at Case Western Reserve University; Dr. Evelyn Griffin, an obstetrician-gynecologist from Louisiana; Dr. Hillary Blackburn, director of medication access and affordability at AscensionRx; and Dr. Raymond Pollak, an organ transplant surgeon with a background in immunology. &lt;/p&gt;

            Chagas disease, a potentially deadly condition caused by a parasite carried by insects called kissing bugs, should now be considered endemic in the United States, experts say – and without recognition that it’s a constant presence in some parts of the country, more people will suffer unnecessarily.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt60002336nkea8aeh9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article" target="_blank"&gt;A report&lt;/a&gt; on the topic was published last week in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, and the authors say they hope that growing global attention on the new paper means Chagas could finally get the surveillance, prevention and testing efforts and research funding it deserves in the United States.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt60004336nqxxclofm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’ve been waiting forever; all of us Chagas people have been waiting for people to recognize this disease is in our communities,” said Dr. Norman Beatty, coauthor of the report and &lt;a href="https://id.medicine.ufl.edu/profile/beatty-norman/" target="_blank"&gt;a clinical associate professor&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Florida College of Medicine’s Division of Infectious Diseases &amp;amp; Global Medicine who has studied Chagas for the past decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt60005336n240rslsr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis)" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; considers Chagas a &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/topics/chagas-disease#:~:text=Chagas%20disease%20is%20a%20parasitic,of%20America%20and%20the%20world." target="_blank"&gt;neglected tropical disease&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/topics/chagas-disease#:~:text=Chagas%20disease%20is%20a%20parasitic,of%20America%20and%20the%20world." target="_blank"&gt;the Pan American Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; says it is endemic – with a constant presence or usual prevalence – in 21 other countries in the Americas, not including the United States. Chagas is one of the leading causes of heart disease in Latin America, and it causes more disability than other insect-borne infections, even more than malaria and Zika, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40475-019-0170-1#ref-CR1" target="_blank"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt60006336nucdkiiww@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Chagas largely spreads when triatomine bugs, commonly known as kissing bugs, bite a human while they’re sleeping. The bug defecates in that bite or on a person’s face, and the person unwittingly wipes the feces into their eyes, nose or mouth. The feces can carry a parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, that causes the disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflo942g00053b6qyfuto9p0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Chagas &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis)" target="_blank"&gt;can also spread&lt;/a&gt; through contaminated food or blood, organ transplants and pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt60007336nnwrt5n09@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Early symptoms can include fever, body aches, headaches, rash, vomiting and tiredness. They may last weeks or even months after initial infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt6000a336n46075m90@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the CDC, about 20% to 30% of people who’ve been infected develop more serious problems like long-term digestive and nervous system conditions, &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000599#:~:text=Background:,suspected%20or%20confirmed%20Chagas%20disease." target="_blank"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt;, stroke or death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt60008336n3bzcz2jk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If it’s caught early, the disease can be cured with benznidazole or nifurtimox, medicines that kill the parasite. But the drugs become less effective the longer a person has been infected, and most people remain unaware of the disease. Many doctors don’t think to look for it in patients in the US, the new report noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflobcrr000a3b6qldijporx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In fact, some people who are infected find out some time later, when they donate blood, since the US has been testing its blood supply for Chagas since 2007.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt6000b336n9zq95kqm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Surveillance is limited, but &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;the CDC estimates&lt;/a&gt; that about 280,000 people in the US have Chagas at any given time. It’s unclear how many have the more serious form of the disease or how many deaths are caused by Chagas each year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt6000c336n8tl8gjl3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists have found kissing bugs in 32 states, the new report says. The blood-sucking insect mostly lives in warmer Southern states, but with climate change causing more bug-friendly temperatures, there’s a good chance they have spread farther.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000d336n8wqdxrky@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientistst have identified at least 17 states with infected mammals, including Virginia opossums, raccoons, banded armadillos, striped skunks, coyotes and wood rats, according to the latest report. Veterinarians have seen infections in zoo animals and pets, including cats, dogs and a horse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000e336nte0v7otw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors have reported Chagas cases in humans in eight states: Arkansas, Arizona, California, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas. There are probably more cases, the new report says, but doctors are not required to report Chagas infections in most states.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsotx0000336nf9fpwfl0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It would be “momentous” for Chagas to be declared endemic in the US, said Dr. Mario J. Grijalva, director of the Infectious and Tropical Disease Institute and professor in the Department of Biomedical Sciences at Ohio University.

            “When you consider it a problem that belongs to others, it’s not important. But when it’s a problem affecting people here, the recognition that it is an endemic disease in the United States is a game-changer, at least in terms of the public policy possibilities and the awareness that is required to properly address this complicated issue,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Grijalva knows firsthand what a difference it can make to have awareness and a concerted health campaign. He spent his recent sabbatical riding a motorcycle across Latin America to spread the word about the condition, after making a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBwYpF14vNs" target="_blank"&gt;similar motorcycle trip in the US&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In countries like Ecuador and Peru where Chagas is endemic but there is no concerted government efforts to manage it, most people were unaware of the disease, Grijalva said. But in Chile, Bolivia and Argentina - all countries with robust health and public awareness campaigns – the people he spoke with knew about Chagas, and many cases were being well-managed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflsoet4000x3b6q7rwyeqhi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There has been a lot of effort to fight this in those countries,” Grijalva said. “It can be fought, and there are a lot of successes.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Beatty hopes broader recognition of Chagas in the US will prompt officials to step up surveillance efforts like what he’s seen in some other countries. He also hopes health care providers learn to recognize cases sooner and wishes the US would work to protect people from kissing bugs like it does mosquitoes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000g336njp70r42p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have mosquito control programs around the country, but we’re essentially doing nothing about kissing bugs,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000h336ng94jpj19@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the meantime, he said, people aiming to keep the insects away can better seal their homes, use window screens and spray for bugs. However, he has not found any particular spray specifically approved to target kissing bugs in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000i336nrqasd7bs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And in Florida, where he works and where about 30% of kissing bugs seem to be positive for the parasites, Beatty said, people will often send him bug photos or even drop the insects off at his hospital to be tested.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000j336nx5zhim7x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’re scared,” he said – and they have a right to be.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000k336np8egbvwy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Beatty said he tries to help his community as best he can. “There’s not another doctor around here walking around with bugs in their pockets,” he said. But with more awareness, he hopes others will step up as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000l336nux2vmww4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m just one person,” Beatty said. “It’s a small team, and we have limited resources.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A key federal vaccine advisory panel whose members were recently replaced by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is expected to vote to recommend delaying, until age 4, the hepatitis B vaccine that's currently given to newborns, according to two former senior officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"There is going to likely be a discussion about hepatitis B vaccine, very specifically trying to dislodge the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine and to push it later in life," said Demetre Daskalakis, the former director for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. "Apparently this is a priority of the Secretary's."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The vote is expected to take place Thursday during the next meeting of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP. The &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/-6uBNXsYRHQ" target="_blank"&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; is scheduled for September 18-19 at a CDC office in Atlanta, Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;For more than 30 years, the CDC has advised that infants get the first of three shots of the hepatitis B vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/perinatal-provider-overview/vaccine-administration.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/HBV/VaccChildren.htm" target="_blank"&gt;at birth&lt;/a&gt;. In that time, the potentially fatal disease has been virtually eradicated among American children. Between 1990 and 2022, case rates plummeted 99 percent among people age 19 and younger.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pediatricians warn that waiting until age 4 to begin vaccination opens the door to more children contracting the virus.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Age four makes zero sense," said pediatrician &lt;a href="https://aapca1.org/profile/eric-ball-md-district-ix-vice-chair/" target="_blank"&gt;Eric Ball&lt;/a&gt;, who practices in Orange County, California. "We recommend a universal approach to prevent those cases where a test might be incorrect or a mother might have unknowingly contracted hepatitis. It's really the best way to keep our entire population healthy."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In addition to the hepatitis B vaccine, the panel &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-09-12-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;will also discuss&lt;/a&gt; and vote on recommendations for the combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine, and COVID vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pediatricians worry changes to the schedules of these vaccines will limit access for many families, because ACIP's recommendations generally determine whether insurance plans and federal programs pay for the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Typically, ACIP would undertake an analysis of the data before recommending a change to vaccine guidelines. As of the end of August, this process had not begun for the hepatitis B vaccines, Daskalakis and another former official said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"This is an atypical situation. There's been no work group to discuss it," Daskalakis said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The second former official spoke to NPR and KFF Health News on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In an email, a Health and Human Services spokesman, Andrew Nixon, wrote, "ACIP exists to ensure that vaccine policy is guided by the best available evidence and open scientific deliberation. Any updates to recommendations will be made transparently with gold standard science."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The draft agenda for the upcoming ACIP meeting was released to the public Sunday, only a few days before the meetings are scheduled to begin.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At the last ACIP meeting in June, chairman Martin Kulldorff, one of the new members handpicked by Kennedy, questioned the need to vaccinate every newborn, citing only two of the many ways the virus can spread.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-88955" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Kulldorff is a former Harvard Medical School professor who became known for opposing some &lt;a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/" target="_blank"&gt;public health measures&lt;/a&gt; during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Unless the mother is hepatitis B positive, an argument could be made to delay the vaccine for this infection, which is primarily spread by sexual activity and intravenous drug use," Kulldorff said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The infection requires direct exposure to infected bodily fluids like blood and semen. The disease has no cure and can lead to serious conditions like cirrhosis and liver cancer later in life. The CDC advisory panel may maintain the recommendation to inoculate newborns whose mothers are considered at high risk of the disease, the former officials said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Protection From Birth&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5125a3.htm?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=transaction#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20acute%20disease,HBV%20infection%20must%20be%20expanded." target="_blank"&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;, federal health officials determined it was advisable for newborns to receive their first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-immunization/stories/hepatitis-b-birth-dose-vaccination-in-africa.html#:~:text=Key%20points%20*%20Mother%2Dto%2Dchild%20transmission%20is%20the,hours%20of%20life%2C%20can%20prevent%20mother%2Dto%2Dchild%20transmission." target="_blank"&gt;24 hours of birth&lt;/a&gt;, which blocks the virus from taking hold if transmitted during delivery. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While parents may opt out of the shots, many daycare centers and school districts &lt;a href="https://www.immunize.org/wp-content/uploads/laws/hepb-ccsch-rqt-map-2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;require proof&lt;/a&gt; of hepatitis B vaccination for enrollment.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The prospect of altering the recommendation has left some people living with the virus deeply unsettled.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I am goddamn frustrated," said &lt;a href="https://wendylo.com/#about" target="_blank"&gt;Wendy Lo&lt;/a&gt;, 52, who lives in the San Francisco Bay area. Lo says she has probably had hepatitis B since birth. Years of navigating the psychological, monetary, medical and social aspects of chronic hepatitis B has impacted almost every aspect of her life.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I would not want anyone to have to experience that if it can be prevented," she said. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lo only learned she had the disease due to a routine screening in order to study abroad in college as a young adult. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lo credits the vaccines with protecting all the members of her close family from infection.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I shared with my partner, 'if you get vaccinated, we can be together,'" she said. He got the vaccine, which protects him from infection, "so I'm grateful for that," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC estimates half of people with hepatitis B &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/about/index.html#:~:text=Although%20HBV%20can%20be%20found,breastfeeding%2C%20or%20food%20or%20water." target="_blank"&gt;do not know&lt;/a&gt; they are infected. It can range from an acute, mild infection to a chronic infection, often with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/clinical-signs/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;few or no symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most people with chronic hepatitis B were born outside of the U.S. Asians and Pacific Islanders, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2020surveillance/hepatitis-b/table-2.6.htm" target="_blank"&gt;followed by&lt;/a&gt; Black people, have the highest rates of newly reported chronic infections.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When her children were born, Lo was adamant that they receive the newborn dose, a decision she says prevented them from contracting the virus.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The earlier an infection occurs, the worse the lifetime consequences, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/perinatal-hepb/downloads/HepB-Provider-tipsheet-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. When contracted in infancy or early childhood, hepatitis B is far more likely to become a chronic infection, silently damaging the liver over decades.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those who become chronic carriers can also unknowingly spread the virus to others and face an increased risk of long-term complications including cirrhosis and liver cancer, which may not become evident until much later in life.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Treatments like the antivirals Lo now takes weren't available until the 1990s. Decades of the virus replicating unchecked damaged her liver. Every six months she gets scared of what her blood tests may reveal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Now I'm in my 50s, one of my big concerns is liver cancer. The vaccine is safe and effective, it's life-saving, and it protects you against cancer. How many vaccines do that?&lt;em&gt;" &lt;/em&gt;Lo said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Thirty Years of Universal Vaccination&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After a vaccine was approved in the 1980s, public health officials initially focused vaccination efforts on so-called "high-risk" adults.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;I, and every other doctor, had been trained in medical school to think of hepatitis B as an infection you acquired as an adult. It was the pimps, the prostitutes, the prisoners, and the healthcare practitioners who got hepatitis B infection. But we've learned so much more," said &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" target="_blank"&gt;William Schaffner&lt;/a&gt;, professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and a &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/person/william-schaffner-md/" target="_blank"&gt;former voting member &lt;/a&gt;of ACIP.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As hepatitis B rates remained stubbornly high in the 1980s, scientists realized an entire vulnerable group was missing from the vaccination regime – newborns. The virus is often&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/prevention/index.html#cdc_prevention_pop-who-is-at-risk" target="_blank"&gt; spread&lt;/a&gt; from an infected mother to baby in late pregnancy or during birth.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We may soon hear 'let's just do a blood test on all pregnant women.' We tried that. That doesn't work perfectly either," Shaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some doctors didn't test, he said, and some pregnant women falsely tested negative, while others acquired hepatitis B later in pregnancy, after they had already been tested. In 1991, Schaffner was a liaison member to the ACIP group that voted to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00033405.htm" target="_blank"&gt;recommend universal vaccination&lt;/a&gt; for hepatitis B before an infant leaves the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;We want no babies infected. Therefore, we'll just vaccinate every mom and every baby at birth. Problem solved. It has been brilliantly successful in virtually eliminating hepatitis B in children," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In 1990, there were 3.03 cases of hepatitis B per 100,000 in those 19 years old and under in the U.S., according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since the federal recommendation to vaccinate all infants, cases have dramatically decreased. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-surveillance-2022/hepatitis-b/figure-2-4.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt; shows that in 2022, the rate of cases among those ages 19 was less than 0.1 per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While hepatitis B is often associated with high-risk behaviors such as injected drug use or multiple sexual partners, &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/hepatitis-b-vaccine#:~:text=How%20do%20you%20catch%20hepatitis,through%20air%2C%20food%20or%20water." target="_blank"&gt;health experts&lt;/a&gt; caution that it is possible for the virus to be transmitted in ordinary situations, especially among young children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The virus can survive for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/rr/rr6701a1.htm#:~:text=Introduction,is%20provided%20(Box%201)." target="_blank"&gt;up to seven days&lt;/a&gt; outside the body. During that time, even microscopic traces of infected blood on a &lt;a href="https://med.umich.edu/1libr/IMMS/RecommendHepBUM.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;school desk or playground equipment&lt;/a&gt; can pose a risk. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If the virus comes into contact with an open wound or the mucous membranes of the eyes, an infection can occur. This means that unvaccinated children who are not considered "high risk" can still be exposed in everyday environments.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Future Access Uncertain&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If the CDC significantly alters its recommendation, health insurers would no longer be required to cover the cost of the shot if given before the new recommended age. That could leave parents to pay out of pocket for a vaccine that has long been provided at no charge. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Children who get immunizations through the federal &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccines for Children&lt;/a&gt; program would lose free access to the shot as soon as any new ACIP recommendations get approved by the acting CDC director.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The two former CDC officials said that plans were underway to push back the official recommendation for the vaccine as of August, when they both left the agency, but may have changed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Schaffner is still a liaison member of ACIP, and hopes to express his support for universal newborn vaccination at the next meeting.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The liaisons have now been excluded from the vaccine work groups. They are still permitted to attend the full meetings," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;He intends to speak up if he can, because he's worried about the next generation of babies and the doctors who care for them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;We'll see cases of hepatitis B once again occur. We'll see transmission into the next generation," he said. "And the next generation of people who wear white coats will have to deal with hepatitis B, when we could have cut it off at the pass."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was produced in partnership with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/about-us/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NPR Health Correspondent Will Stone contributed to this story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Parkinson's Disease affects around a million people in the United States, and that number is on the rise, in part because our population is getting older.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ucihealth.org/clinicians/claire-henchcliffe-1730276825" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Claire Henchcliffe&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the chair of neurology at the University of California, Irvine. She's one of the scientists at the forefront of Parkinson's research, and she says Parkinson's is the fastest growing out of the neurodegenerative disorders she deals with as a neurologist.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's very concerning that it's growing so quickly," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Parkinson's is a progressive disorder that causes difficulty with movement. But Henchcliffe says people also deal with symptoms that are harder to see, like memory, cognition problems, or onset of depression or anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;People are typically diagnosed around age 50 or 60, but the process of developing Parkinson's begins in the brain much earlier.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It may start 10, 15, 20 years before we ever pick up a tremor or ever see someone slow down," Henchcliffe says. "Sense of smell can alter, sleep can change … That's when the Parkinson's process in the brain has started. It's kicked off. But we don't have the wherewithal yet to be able to diagnose that process for sure."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Henchcliffe is one of many brain scientists working toward new treatment options for Parkinson's, including recent discoveries about the potential use of stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Science correspondent &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/people/2100615/jon-hamilton" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jon Hamilton&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; dives into this research — and even a future where scientists can prevent the disease altogether — on the show with Henchcliffe.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interested in more on the future of brain science?

&lt;p&gt;BAVINA SOOKDEO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, thousands of families in Trinidad and Tobago are affected by sudden strokes, heart attacks and amputations – events often linked to one hidden culprit: vascular disease. According to Prof Vijay Naraynsingh, distinguished surgeon and researcher who works at Medical Associates Hospital, St Joseph, this condition quietly threatens lives across TT, but with awareness and prevention, many cases can be avoided. He spoke to the Newsday as the world observes Vascular Disease Awareness Month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naraynsingh explained that vascular really means vessels. “We’re talking about blood vessels or lymphatic vessels – arteries, veins and lymphatics. Lymphatics are the ones that carry fluid, but really arterial and venous are the two more common conditions. All the arteries and the veins will be part of our vascular speciality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a career spanning over 45 years, the doctor, likens the vascular system to a household piping network: “The heart pumps blood like water into your house. If there’s a blockage in a pipe, it affects where it’s going. A blockage to the brain can cause a stroke, to the heart – a heart attack, to the kidneys – kidney failure and to the legs – gangrene and amputation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to veins, varicose veins are the most common issue. However, as Naraynsingh pointed out, it’s the arteries that are far more dangerous. He noted that in TT, the leading cause of death is heart disease, followed closely by strokes – both of which are vascular conditions. “In the system of pipes, the pipes go bad with age. They can go bad with other things too (like smoking and with cholesterol issues) but by and large, the pipes degenerate with age,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1551210817264-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while these age-related changes are expected, lifestyle factors are accelerating the problem, making vascular disease an increasingly urgent concern. Naraynsingh warned that cases of vascular disease are on the rise, also driven by increasing rates of diabetes, obesity and hypertension – and worryingly, it is now appearing more often in younger people as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_1178430" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1178430" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-1178430" src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/24386887-893x1024.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-1178430" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;-&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the surgeon, vascular disease is rarely confined to one area. “When you have vascular disease, it’s a multi-system disorder. You cannot have one pipe rusting and assume the rest are fine. If someone has heart disease, chances are they also have issues in their brain, kidneys, or limbs. It’s a generalised disease that just manifests in a particular organ at that time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naraynsingh further explained that when a patient goes to him with a stroke, he does not treat the stroke in isolation. After addressing the immediate issue, he also investigates for heart disease, kidney disease, lower limb disease and signs of generalised vascular disease, with the aim of controlling the condition across the entire system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emphasising that prevention is the best defence, Naraynsingh advised, “The easiest thing is to do your regular checks – blood pressure, sugar, lipids. When we see abnormalities even before symptoms appear, we can start preventative measures like losing weight, exercising (which everyone should be doing), stopping smoking and using medication if necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screening, he added, is especially critical for those at higher risk. “If you are diabetic, you need fairly extensive checks – your heart, eyes, kidneys, carotids and lower limbs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for treatment, it varies depending on how the disease presents. “If the problem is diabetes or hypertension, we aim for tight control,” Naraynsingh explained. “If there’s vessel narrowing, we can use blood thinners like aspirin or Plavix, or medication to lower cholesterol.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surgical options have also evolved. Naraynsingh explained that surgery for vascular disease varies depending on severity and location. In the heart, the most common procedure is bypass surgery, but milder cases may only require angioplasty and stenting. In angioplasty, a wire is inserted into the narrowed vessel, and a balloon is inflated to widen it. If the vessel collapses again, a stent – “like a collapsible wire fence” – is placed to keep it open. Bypass surgery, on the other hand, leaves the blocked vessel in place but creates a new pathway, like laying a fresh pipe alongside a blocked one and joining it above and below the obstruction. For patients with strokes or reduced blood flow to the brain, surgeons often operate on the carotid artery in the neck, removing the plaque in a procedure called endarterectomy. For lower limb disease, both bypass surgery and angioplasty with stenting are common. Ultimately, he stressed, the technique depends on the extent, location, and number of blockages, since ‘a pipe doesn’t rust in just one spot – it rusts in many.’ There is no one-size-fits-all treatment; it must be tailored to each patient’s pattern of disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest barriers, Naraynsingh believes, is the lack of timely access to advanced care. “People don’t understand the value of what I call ‘snatch and run,’” he explained. If someone has chest pain, families often wait on an ambulance – which can take half an hour, an hour, or even longer – when in reality, no hospital in Trinidad is more than 20 to 30 minutes away. “While you’re waiting on the ambulance, the patient could die” he stressed. The most important thing is getting them to the hospital quickly. The bigger issue, he added, is what happens after arrival. In the entire public system, there is only one Cath lab (a hospital procedure room with specialised imaging equipment used to diagnose and treat heart conditions), located at Mount Hope and it is not a 24-hour service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1551381418315-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_1178432" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1178432" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-1178432" src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/24386885.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-1178432" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Prof Vijay Naraynsingh -&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ideally, we should have at least two or three major hospitals equipped with trained personnel available 24/7 to handle emergencies the moment a patient arrives, because every minute lost means the heart muscle is dying.” The same urgency applies to strokes, where patients must receive treatment within four hours before brain tissue is irreversibly damaged. “Time is brain,” he stressed. “If you arrive too late, even if the clot is removed, the brain cells are already dead.” He noted that private Cath labs exist, but they remain prohibitively expensive for many patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His message during Vascular Disease Awareness Month is to “Get screened and do your regular checks. For diabetics especially, be vigilant and do extensive checks. We have not decreased our amputation rate in Trinidad and Tobago yet, and we need to work aggressively on that but it requires a multi-tiered approach.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At both a personal and national level, the fight against vascular disease comes down to prevention, awareness and timely care. “We really need to increase public awareness of how urgent the matter is. When somebody gets a heart attack or a stroke, you get them to an institution fast. Time is brain, time is heart,” the doctor warned.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;

FILE PHOTO - "&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;President of the TT Association of Psychologists, Kelly McFarlane. FILE PHOTO - &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As World Suicide Prevention Day was observed on September 10, TT finds itself facing a stark reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health Observatory Data Repository, this country ranks fifth in the Caribbean for suicide mortality rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against this troubling backdrop, president of the TT Association of Psychologists (TTAP), Kelly Mc Farlane, is sounding the alarm, especially for workers recently affected by sweeping job cuts in programmes like Cepep, the reforestation programme, and URP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These individuals, she warns, are particularly vulnerable to mental health challenges stemming from financial insecurity, identity disruption, and daily stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mc Farlane outlined several evidence-based strategies proven to help individuals cope with sudden unemployment and its psychological toll. She emphasised the importance of regulating the nervous system and maintaining a sense of control, starting with the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239531467-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the most effective tools is slow, diaphragmatic breathing, done two to three times a day,” she said. “It’s been shown to reduce cortisol levels and lower blood pressure, both of which spike under chronic stress. It trains the body to respond differently to stress over time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In tandem with breathing techniques, Mc Farlane recommends grounding practices and maintaining structured daily routines. Even without formal employment, she noted, people can benefit from creating consistency around meals, exercise, reading, job searches, or caring for family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This structure helps support your circadian rhythm, which plays a critical role in regulating mood.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another essential technique Mc Farlane highlighted is behavioural activation, which focuses on intentionally scheduling small, purposeful tasks to help re-engage with life after a setback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Losing a job certainly qualifies as a major life disruption. Even minor activities, like cleaning a room or applying for one job, can provide a sense of purpose and help guard against depression.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the most powerful buffer against emotional decline, she said, is human connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Social support is absolutely essential. We are wired to connect. Everyone needs at least one trusted person they can talk to, whether it’s a friend, a relative, or a peer. Just having someone to speak with regularly helps buffer the stress response.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Mc Farlane, these connections do more than offer comfort. They reduce biological markers associated with depression. She says it is not just psychological: it’s physiological.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Isolation worsens things, while connection heals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239585826-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also encouraged the use of cognitive reframing, a psychological technique that helps people view distressing situations through a more constructive lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cognitive reframing isn’t about pretending things are fine,” she explained. “It’s about acknowledging the reality but choosing a perspective that doesn’t add to your distress. That’s a powerful mental shift. You’re actively changing how your brain processes the situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mc Farlane said many affected workers live in the same communities and could benefit from peer support groups—informal spaces for shared listening, encouragement, and healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These can be very effective. They don’t have to be formal or expensive. It could be a group that meets in someone’s home, at a community centre, or on Zoom. What matters is creating a safe space to talk and be heard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She urged anyone feeling overwhelmed not to suffer in silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Symptoms can vary, but they often include persistent sadness, withdrawal from activities, and changes in sleep or appetite. If you’re experiencing these, especially as a parent trying to hold it all together, please reach out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognising many may now face financial strain, McFarlane highlighted several free resources available for those in need of help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who to turn to if you need of help:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Ministry of Social Development &amp;amp; Family Services: 800-COPE (2673)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239666137-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Lifeline Trinidad &amp;amp; Tobago: 645-2800&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Childline TT: Phone, WhatsApp, and chat-based counselling for those 25 and under.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– St Ann’s Psychiatric Hospital&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Hospitals with Psychiatric Services: San Fernando General, Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex, Scarborough General.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– FindCareTT.com: A national directory of mental health and psychosocial support services, including low-cost and free options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– UMatter Chatline (UWI + UNICEF): Text-based mental health support for youth, with trained volunteers and referral options.

Then the mystery deepened. An examination of the man's neck revealed two surprising things: first, he had a cervical rib, an extra rib seen in around one percent of people; and second, there was a quartz point in the sediment in which the man was interred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On closer inspection, the researchers found that the quartz point had been deliberately worked, probably as a projectile. Also, it wasn't local stone by a long shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It doesn't match any other stone tools from Thung Binh 1 or nearby sites, raising questions about who made it and where it came from," &lt;a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/press-office/press-releases/ancient-cave-discovery-points-to-southeast-asia-s-earliest-human.html"&gt;says archaeologist Benjamin Utting&lt;/a&gt; of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking more closely at the bones, the researchers were able to piece together a likely sequence of events. One of the man's cervical ribs showed signs of fracture, but also infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stimpson and his colleague believe the man was struck by a stone-tipped projectile in his neck, where it lodged after damaging his rib. Infection then set into the wound, and the man sickened and died several days to weeks after the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174265" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174265" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/fracture.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-174265" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/fracture.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/fracture-600x314.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174265" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The fracture trauma from multiple angles (left) and the stone point (right).

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep may enhance the brain’s ability to remove harmful waste. Poor or disrupted sleep could raise dementia risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain possesses its own system for removing waste, known as the &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00031.2020"&gt;glymphatic system&lt;/a&gt;, which is believed to become more active during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When sleep is disrupted, this cleaning process may be impaired, slowing the removal of toxins and other waste products from the brain. &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abb8739"&gt;Researchers suggest&lt;/a&gt; that the accumulation of such toxins due to inadequate sleep could contribute to a higher risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty remains about how exactly the glymphatic system functions in humans, as much of the current evidence comes from mouse studies. Still, these findings raise the possibility that better sleep could enhance the clearance of harmful substances in the brain and thereby lower dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what researchers currently understand about this developing field of study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why waste matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All cells in the body generate waste. Outside the brain, the lymphatic system removes this material by carrying it from the spaces between cells into the bloodstream through a network of vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain, however, lacks its own lymphatic vessels. Until about 12 years ago, scientists did not know how the brain handled its waste. That changed with the discovery of the glymphatic system, which was described as a mechanism that “&lt;a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/46/18190"&gt;flushes out&lt;/a&gt;” toxins from the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/cerebrospinal-fluid"&gt;Cerebrospinal fluid&lt;/a&gt;, which surrounds both the brain and spinal cord, plays a central role in this process. The fluid flows around blood vessels in the brain, then moves into the spaces between brain cells, where it collects waste before draining out through large veins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies in mice later demonstrated that the glymphatic system becomes most active &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1241224"&gt;during sleep&lt;/a&gt;, with waste removal markedly increased at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the substances cleared through this system is amyloid beta (Aβ) protein. When Aβ builds up in the brain, it can form plaques. Alongside tangles of another protein, tau, found in neurons, these plaques are key features of &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/whats-the-difference-between-alzheimers-and-dementia-225271"&gt;&lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_44d955d660610a76fe199b3479668107" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/span&gt; disease, the most common form of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In humans and mice, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1180962"&gt;studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; that levels of Aβ detected in the cerebrospinal fluid increase when awake and then rapidly fall during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more recently, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-024-01638-y"&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; (in mice) showed pretty much the opposite – suggesting the glymphatic system is more active in the daytime. Researchers are debating what might explain the findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we still have some way to go before we can say exactly how the glymphatic system works – in mice or humans – to clear the brain of toxins that might otherwise increase the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Does this happen in humans too?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know sleeping well is good for us, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn.2017.55"&gt;particularly our brain health&lt;/a&gt;. We are all aware of the short-term effects of sleep deprivation on our brain’s ability to function, and we know &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00054.2024"&gt;sleep helps improve memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one experiment, a single night of complete sleep deprivation in healthy adults &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1721694115"&gt;increased the amount&lt;/a&gt; of Aβ in the hippocampus, an area of the brain implicated in Alzheimer’s disease. This suggests sleep can influence the clearance of Aβ from the human brain, supporting the idea that the human glymphatic system is more active while we sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also raises the question of whether good sleep might lead to better clearance of toxins such as Aβ from the brain, and so be a potential target to prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How about sleep apnea or insomnia?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is less clear is what long-term disrupted sleep, for instance if someone has a sleep disorder, means for the body’s ability to clear Aβ from the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sleephealthfoundation.org.au/sleep-disorders/obstructive-sleep-apnoea"&gt;Sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt; is a common sleep disorder when someone’s breathing stops multiple times as they sleep. This can lead to chronic (long-term) sleep deprivation, and reduced oxygen in the blood. Both may be implicated in the accumulation of toxins in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep apnea has also been linked with an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13589"&gt;increased risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;. And we now know that after people are treated for sleep apnea &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsx011"&gt;more Aβ is cleared from the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sleephealthfoundation.org.au/sleep-disorders/insomnia-2"&gt;Insomnia&lt;/a&gt; is when someone has difficulty falling asleep and/or staying asleep. When this happens in the long term, there’s also an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318814"&gt;increased risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;. However, we don’t know the effect of treating insomnia on toxins associated with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So again, it’s still too early to say for sure that treating a sleep disorder reduces your risk of dementia because of reduced levels of toxins in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;So where does this leave us?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collectively, these studies suggest enough good quality sleep is important for a healthy brain, and in particular for clearing toxins associated with dementia from the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we still don’t know if &lt;em&gt;treating&lt;/em&gt; a sleep disorder or improving sleep more broadly affects the brain’s ability to remove toxins, and whether this reduces the risk of dementia. It’s an area researchers, including us, are actively working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, we’re investigating the &lt;a href="https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/projects/understanding-brain-cleaning-in-obstructive-sleep-apnoea"&gt;concentration of Aβ and tau measured in blood&lt;/a&gt; across the 24-hour sleep-wake cycle in people with sleep apnea, on and off treatment, to better understand how sleep apnea affects brain cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers are also looking into the potential for treating insomnia with a class of drugs &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44323-025-00025-5"&gt;known as orexin receptor antagonists&lt;/a&gt; to see if this affects the &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06823752"&gt;clearance of Aβ from the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;If you’re concerned&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an emerging field and we don’t yet have all the answers about the link between &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-dangerous-is-insomnia-how-fear-of-what-its-doing-to-your-body-can-wreck-your-sleep-212248"&gt;disrupted sleep and dementia&lt;/a&gt;, or whether better sleep can boost the glymphatic system and so prevent cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you are concerned about your sleep or cognition, please see your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Deep-brain structures like the basal ganglia or the thalamus wield major influence on our behavior. If something goes awry, dysregulation in the deep brain may trigger neurological conditions &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-could-be-ignited-by-burned-out-brain-cells"&gt;like Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-scans-identify-six-distinct-types-of-depression-and-anxiety"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the clear importance of these structures, our knowledge about them remains limited by their location, making&lt;span&gt; them difficult to study and treat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, researchers unveil a device that might offer an alternative to invasive procedures. Featuring a novel ultrasound helmet, it not only modulates deep-brain circuits without surgery, but reportedly can do so with unrivaled precision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultrasound-can-probe-deep-into-the-brain-to-relieve-pain"&gt;Ultrasound Can Probe Deep Into The Brain to Relieve Pain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology represents a leap forward in our ability to study and influence the deep brain, says senior author Bradley Treeby, a biomedical engineer at University College London (UCL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This advance opens up opportunities for both neuroscience research and clinical treatment. For the first time, scientists can non-invasively study causal relationships in deep-brain circuits that were previously only accessible through surgery," Treeby &lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2025-09-09-new-ultrasound-helmet-enables-deep-brain-stimulation-people-without-surgery"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clinically, this new technology could transform treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="174012" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; disease,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="174012" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, and essential tremor," he &lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2025-09-09-new-ultrasound-helmet-enables-deep-brain-stimulation-people-without-surgery"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;, "offering unprecedented precision in targeting specific brain circuits that play key roles in these conditions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new system builds on existing methods like transcranial ultrasound stimulation and MRI-guided focused ultrasound, but it's designed to address limitations of each, such as the former's low focal precision and the latter's need for stabilizing skull screws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new helmet can target areas in the brain 1,000 times smaller than conventional ultrasound devices can, and 30 times smaller than similar technologies that specifically target deeper areas of the brain, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It does this using an array of 256 elements configured on the helmet's interior, which emit focused ultrasound beams at specific areas of the wearer's brain to raise or reduce neuronal activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174338" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174338" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ultrasound_helmet_642.jpg" alt="breakdown of ultrasound helmet" class="wp-image-174338 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ultrasound_helmet_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ultrasound_helmet_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ultrasound_helmet_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174338" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A schematic of the ultrasound helmet.

Functional  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="174012" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt; (fMRI) scans showed a simultaneous surge of activity in the visual cortex, suggesting the LGN was successfully hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This real-time monitoring capability is an important feature, says first author Eleanor Martin, a physicist and engineer in UCL's Biomedical Ultrasound Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We designed the system to be compatible with simultaneous fMRI, enabling us to monitor the effects of stimulation in real time," she &lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2025-09-09-new-ultrasound-helmet-enables-deep-brain-stimulation-people-without-surgery"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. "This opens up exciting possibilities for closed-loop neuromodulation and personalised therapies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another experiment demonstrated the durability of the helmet's effects, with changes in visual cortex activity continuing for 40 minutes after stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subjects reported no conscious perception of any visual changes during these tests, the researchers note, yet  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="174012" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fMRI scans&lt;/a&gt; nonetheless revealed significant and persistent shifts in neural activity at the intended locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ability to precisely modulate deep-brain structures without surgery represents a paradigm shift in neuroscience, offering a safe, reversible, and repeatable method for both understanding brain function and developing targeted therapies," Treeby &lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2025-09-09-new-ultrasound-helmet-enables-deep-brain-stimulation-people-without-surgery"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/smart-brain-implants-can-now-adapt-to-optimize-parkinsons-treatment"&gt;Smart Brain Implants Can Now Adapt to Optimize Parkinson's Treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to fully explain what's happening in this process, the researchers point out, but these results already amount to a breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such deft neuromodulation was previously impossible without invasive methods, and it offers new hope for patients with certain conditions, says co-author and clinical neuroscientist Ioana Grigoras from the University of Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are particularly excited about its potential clinical applications for neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, where deep-brain regions are especially affected," Grigoras &lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2025-09-09-new-ultrasound-helmet-enables-deep-brain-stimulation-people-without-surgery"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63020-1"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Cyclists tend to do some pretty weird and wonderful things in the hope of improving performance. We’ll try any supplement or diet trend with even the faintest promise of improvement, we’ll tinker with and tweak our bikes until the cows come home, and we’ll try all sorts of strange tech in the hope of accessing even the most marginal of gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what about shining a bunch of light through your skull and up your nose, into your brain, all in the hope of improving time trial performance? Yep, you read that right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-pbm"&gt;What is PBM?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you might be able to tell from the name, photobiomodulation (or PBM) is a technique that involves shining light into the body in order to stimulate various effects. The light used is in the red to near-infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum – normally with wavelengths between 600 and 1,100 nm – and depending on what sort of tissue you point that light at, it can generate a range of different outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Point it at muscle tissue and it’s possible to &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2411-5142/8/4/144?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;induce an increase in oxygen demand&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which can ultimately lead to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s40279-022-01714-y?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;improved performance in time-to-exhaustion tests&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Directing it at the muscles also seems to help with the repair of those muscles, due to a &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/ajpmr/abstract/2014/12000/effects_of_low_level_laser_therapy_on_skeletal.7.aspx?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;“reduction in the inflammatory process”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And it turns out that transcranial PBM – that is, firing those infrared lights through your skull and into your brain cells – can both &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/13/11/966?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;enhance cognitive abilities in healthy brains&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and also has some potential when it comes to treating neurodegenerative conditions &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0278412&amp;amp;ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;including Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how does it work exactly? To simplify a &lt;a href="https://soterixmedical.com/research/tpbm?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;rather complex process&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the absorption of infrared light within the brain cells seems to lead to increased blood flow in the brain, in addition to enhanced hemoglobin oxygenation (you might recall that hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the body’s tissues). These factors, in turn, lead to increased activation of the brain areas targeted by the PBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxygenation levels in the brain are also relevant if we’re talking about exercise performance. Various studies have shown that a &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00909.2014?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;drop in cerebral oxygenation during high-intensity exercise is associated with exhaustion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and that deoxygenation of the prefrontal cortex in particular seems to contribute to “the cessation of exercise” during controlled and self-paced efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if there’s a link between oxygenation levels in the brain and exercise performance, could it be that &lt;em&gt;increasing&lt;/em&gt; oxygenation in the brain – via a technique like PBM – might help improve cycling performance?&lt;/p&gt;

In 2022, for every 100,000 people worldwide, on average about 197 were diagnosed with cancer that year. Men fared worse, at 212, compared to 186 for women, according to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.wcrf.org/preventing-cancer/cancer-statistics/global-cancer-data-by-country/page/2/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;World Cancer Research Fund&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Nearly 20 million cancer cases were diagnosed globally in 2022 - about 10.3 million in men and 9.7 million in women. In the US, the estimated lifetime risk of cancer is nearly equal for men and women, according to the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In India, the most common cancers among women are breast, cervical, and ovarian. Breast and cervical cancers make up 40% of female cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;While cervical cancer is largely linked to infections such as human papillomavirus (HPV), breast and ovarian cancers are often influenced by hormonal factors. Rising cases of these hormone-related cancers are also associated with lifestyle shifts - including later pregnancies, reduced breastfeeding, obesity, and sedentary habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;For men, oral, lung, and prostate cancers dominate. Tobacco drives 40% of preventable cancers, mainly oral and lung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;So what is going on in India? Is it an earlier diagnosis for women? Are men's cancers more aggressive, or is it that habits such as smoking and chewing tobacco drag down their outcomes? Or does the answer lie in differences in access, awareness and treatment between genders?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-86c96223-1 evkFpM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-86c96223-0 iMuqLZ hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Gautam Bose People wearing skeleton outfits take part in a rally encouraging others not to use tobacco products in Kolkata, India, on May 31, 2025.

Their cancers are more often tied to lifestyle - tobacco and alcohol drive lung and oral cancers, both aggressive and less responsive to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Men are also less likely to go for preventive check-ups or seek medical help early. The result: higher mortality and poorer outcomes, even when incidence is lower than among women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Women's health has become a bigger focus in public health campaigns, and that's a double-edged sword. Greater awareness and screening mean more cancers are detected early. For men, the conversation rarely goes beyond tobacco and oral cancer," Ravi Mehrotra, a cancer specialist and head of the non-profit Centre for Health Innovation and Policy (CHIP) Foundation, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Women, through reproductive health checks, are more likely to see a doctor at some stage. Many men, by contrast, may go their whole lives without ever seeing one," Dr Mehrotra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But the real story emerges when the numbers are broken down: India's cancer burden is unevenly spread across regions, and across the types of cancer people face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Data from 43 registries show that 11 out of every 100 people in India run the risk of developing cancer at some point during their life. An estimated 1.56 million cases and 874,000 deaths are projected for 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The hilly and relatively remote northeast region remains India's cancer hotspot, with Mizoram's Aizawl district recording lifetime risks twice the national average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Doctors say much of this is down to lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"For most cancers in the north-eastern state, I'm convinced lifestyle is the key factor. Tobacco use is rampant here - much higher than elsewhere," R Ravi Kannan, head of Cachar Cancer Hospital and Research Centre in Assam, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"In Barak Valley in Assam, it's mostly chewing tobacco; just 25km away in Mizoram, smoking dominates. Add to that alcohol, areca nuts, and even how meat is prepared. Food choices and preparation drive cancer risk. There's no special cancer-causing gene at play - hereditary cancers aren't more common here than in other parts of India," Dr Kannan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But the pattern isn't confined to the northeast. Srinagar in Indian-administered Kashmir tops the charts for lung cancer in men, while southern Hyderabad city leads in breast cancer. Men in the capital, Delhi, are being diagnosed with all cancers put together at a higher rate than men in other regions, even after correcting for age differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Oral cancer is also rising: 14 population registries report increases among men and four among women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-86c96223-1 evkFpM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-86c96223-0 iMuqLZ hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="AFP via Getty Images A woman sits beside Malsawm Puia, 28, who suffers from blood cancer, in Kale township on the India-Myanmar border, on April 17, 2024.

The disparities seen across Indian states mirror a global divide shaped by geography, income, and access to care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In wealthy nations, one in 12 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during her lifetime, but only one in 71 will die from it, according to WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In poorer countries, the picture is reversed: just one in 27 women will ever receive a diagnosis, yet as many as one in 48 will die of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Women in lower Human Development Index (HDI) countries are 50% less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than women in high HDI countries, yet they are at a much higher risk of dying of the disease due to late diagnosis and inadequate access to quality treatment," says Isabelle Soerjomataram, Deputy Head of the Cancer Surveillance Branch at International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Then there are other differences. In the US, for example, native Americans face the highest cancer mortality, with kidney, liver, stomach, and cervical cancer deaths two to three times higher than whites; black people also have double the mortality of whites for prostate, stomach, and uterine cancers, according to American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In India, the cancer burden is not just growing - it is becoming more complex. Registry data reflect a society in transition, where longevity, lifestyle, and environment are reshaping health risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Yet amid this shifting landscape, many questions remain, underscoring the urgent need for targeted prevention, early detection, and lifestyle changes, including healthier diets and habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;i id="follow-bbc-news-india-on" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;Follow BBC News India on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;&lt;i id="youtube," class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;YouTube,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBCIndia" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 00:32:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5nZkxMcFRTdVp3aXE2OUNkV0JLMGVCV2ZZMEhzb2ZHaTZuS1J2aEp3aGxwV3JrMWt6aUZuV1ZzMnpSeHAzTkh5X2RUOVgzTmcwNWxBMGtTdS1WZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE1UdjZyQXE2VGJsV2tHOFJiZXVNMnFfLWVBWWlRVGhoWjBoM2VZVXlxYWZ6bDR1VWpFalpyTWlQcmV2ejhmU0tDVUxRbEEtRk1Ia2U4eEFvM3RsMDB4N2lZ</guid></item><item><title>心理学研究人员确定了“极端主义倦怠”的渠道- PsyPost</title><link>http://www.psypost.org/psychology-researchers-identify-a-burnout-to-extremism-pipeline/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Luigi Mangione was arrested for the alleged murder of the CEO of UnitedHealthcare in December 2024, public reaction shocked observers. Far from universal condemnation, many people expressed support. This was especially true among younger people, with polls showing &lt;a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/december-2024-national-poll-young-voters-diverge-from-majority-on-crypto-tiktok-and-ceo-assassination/"&gt;41% of young adults&lt;/a&gt; viewed the murder as acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what leads the average person to justify extreme violence? &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/vio0000643"&gt;Our recently published research&lt;/a&gt;, in the special issue &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/vio/understanding-violent-extremism"&gt;“Understanding violent extremism”&lt;/a&gt; of the APA &lt;em&gt;Journal Psychology of Violence&lt;/em&gt;, locates the answer in one increasingly widespread phenomenon: workplace burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mangione’s &lt;a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/luigis-manifesto"&gt;manifesto&lt;/a&gt; cites “corruption and greed” as a source of frustration, a sentiment that resonates widely amid growing dissatisfaction with modern work environments. &lt;a href="https://clinicalsocialwork.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cswhi_03_2024_02_butz_OPR_04.pdf"&gt;Recent research&lt;/a&gt; shows that broader patterns of systemic frustration and perceived corruption are associated with burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study, which took daily surveys from over 600 employees, suggests burnout may quietly fuel worrying attitudes – specifically, the potential justification of violent extremism – towards the perceived source of their distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The burnout to extremism pipeline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our study, employees made daily notes of their burnout symptoms, emotional states, and violent extremist attitudes. On days when employees felt more burnt out, they reported significantly more sympathy toward extremist ideas, such as justifying violence against perceived injustices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The daily grind of burnout produced negative feelings of fear, sadness, shame, and guilt. To alleviate these negative feelings – and regain a sense of purpose – some individuals appeared to find extremist ideologies more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon can be explained through the combined lens of three established psychological theories. The first is &lt;a href="https://oxfordre.com/criminology/display/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264079.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264079-e-249"&gt;General Strain Theory&lt;/a&gt;, which suggests that daily frustrations lead to violent extremism through the experience of negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second is the &lt;a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315227979-4/burnout-existential-perspective-ayala-pines"&gt;existential model of burnout&lt;/a&gt;, which links burnout to a failed existential quest when meaningfulness in work disappears. Last is &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1037/gpr0000144"&gt;Significance Quest Theory&lt;/a&gt;, which argues that when the sense of personal significance is eroded in people’s everyday lives, they might look elsewhere, including to radical beliefs, to restore meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In combination, these ideas, particularly the existential and Significance Quest models, suggest that burnout reflects a failed search for meaning – one that may drive individuals toward violent extremism as a means of restoration. General Strain Theory further contributes by emphasising the emotional path involved in this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why burnout matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study does not suggest that individuals experiencing burnout will inevitably engage in extremist violence. Rather, it demonstrates how everyday experiences of burnout can subtly shift individuals toward violent extremist attitudes, thereby normalising the acceptance of violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This distinction is critical and is emphasised in the &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Famp0000062"&gt;two-pyramids model&lt;/a&gt;, which differentiates between radicalisation of opinion and radicalisation of action. While the link between the two may be weak, radicalisation of opinion alone can pose a &lt;a href="https://www.ijcv.org/index.php/ijcv/article/view/3807"&gt;serious threat to democracies and open societies&lt;/a&gt; by eroding social cohesion and fostering polarisation. For this reason, it warrants focused study in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, workplace burnout is alarmingly common, affecting approximately &lt;a href="https://www.vanede.nl/media/2669/gallup-iii-employee-burnout.pdf"&gt;three in four employees&lt;/a&gt;. This means a huge portion of the workforce experiences the emotional strain capable of fuelling extremist ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the vast majority will never resort to violence, a society that becomes increasingly tolerant of extremist attitudes risks normalising destructive behaviours and undermining both democratic values and workplace cohesion. Moreover, even if only a small minority ultimately engage in violence, the consequences can still be profound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Organisational support can help&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings also reveal an effective form of protection: &lt;a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf&amp;amp;doi=b6e9be0e81ee13424f7140685a689bd2d85d7d3c"&gt;perceived organisational support&lt;/a&gt;. Employees who felt that their organisations genuinely valued their contributions and cared about their wellbeing were less likely to gravitate toward extremist ideologies, even when experiencing burnout symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there’s a critical caveat to this: organisational support is most effective at mitigating the harmful effects of burnout before negative emotions take hold. Once employees have crossed that emotional threshold, additional support alone has limited power to prevent the escalation toward violent extremist attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employers therefore hold the key to addressing burnout before it escalates into something more serious. Organisations must proactively invest in burnout prevention, not merely as a health initiative, but as a vital strategy for preserving stability, both in the workplace and in society at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means promoting fairness and transparency in the workplace, ensuring employees feel recognised and valued, training managers to identify early signs of burnout and respond proactively, and establishing open, safe channels for employee feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns about fairness don’t stop at the office door. Broader perceptions of injustice in society may also fuel extremist sympathies, especially when individuals are already mentally exhausted. For instance, efforts to pursue the &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-pamela-bondi-directs-prosecutors-seek-death-penalty-luigi-mangione"&gt;death penalty against Mangione to serve President Trump’s political agenda&lt;/a&gt; may deepen perceptions of systemic unfairness, which will only exacerbate radical views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The broader implications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burnout is more than just workplace exhaustion or disengagement. It signals a deeper and more dangerous existential vulnerability. A workplace that ignores employee burnout doesn’t just risk lower productivity – it creates a breeding ground for ideological radicalisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As both workplaces and societies confront a surge in extremist sentiment, including support for violent acts framed as resistance to corporate greed, it is crucial that we learn to recognise the underlying psychological triggers. Burnout is one of them, and employees don’t just need support to do their jobs better – they need it to maintain a sense of meaning, stability, and connection in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A burnt-out mind will seek meaning wherever it can find it. If the workplace fails to offer that, extremist ideologies are often ready to fill the void, with consequences that reach far beyond the office walls.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261123/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261123/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

But did you know how important it is to consume breakfast on time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Beat belly fat with millets: Easy breakfast ideas for quick weight loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43856-025-01035-x" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;A new study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; is shedding light on the surprising link between meal timings and longevity, suggesting that delaying breakfast is linked with a higher risk of death, along with other health issues such as fatigue, depression, poor sleep, and oral health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to know more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the study says&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the saying now goes: How late you eat the first meal of the day might be just as important as what’s on the plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/09/early-breakfast-could-help-you-live-longer/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;major new study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; following nearly 3,000 adults aged 42-94 over more than 20 years, suggests that delaying breakfast is linked with a higher risk of death, along with other health issues such as fatigue, depression, poor sleep, and oral health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Mass General Brigham (Harvard-affiliated) and the University of Manchester analyzed data from 2,945 UK adults aged between 42 and 94, tracking them for about 22 years, to see how changes in the timing of breakfast and dinner relate to health and mortality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Dr. Hassan Dashti (Massachusetts General Hospital) in collaboration with the University of Manchester, the research added fresh evidence to the growing field of chrononutrition – the idea that the timing of meals (not just what we eat) influences health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that as people grow older, meal times tend to drift later – both breakfast and dinner – and the overall eating window (time in a day during which people eat) becomes narrower. The most eye-opening result? For each extra hour breakfast was delayed, there was about an 8-11% higher risk of mortality (death from any cause) during the follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, late breakfast times were linked with other health problems. Many participants who ate late also reported poorer sleep, fatigue, depression, difficulty preparing meals, and worse oral health. Those are signs not just of bad habits but sometimes of under-recognized health issues. Genetic predisposition to “late chronotype” (natural inclination to stay up late and wake up later) was also associated with later breakfast times, suggesting some of the timing shift may be built in, or influenced by internal body clocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why &lt;keyword id="14175499" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="breakfast-timing" source="Orion"&gt;breakfast timing&lt;/keyword&gt; might matter&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just about being an early bird and someone who chooses to stick to the clock a bit too religiously. There are several biological, lifestyle, and psychological reasons timing seems to make a difference, especially in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Circadian rhythms:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our body’s internal clock regulates many functions, like sleep, digestion, hormone release, and metabolism. When you delay eating relative to waking time, you may misalign your meals with optimal metabolic windows. That could reduce how well nutrients are processed and increase stress on systems (e.g., glucose regulation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sleep and energy:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Later breakfasts often go hand-in-hand with poorer sleep, fatigue, or disrupted routines. If you wake late or sleep badly, your body may already be under strain; so eating late might be more of an ‘effect’ than a ‘cause’ in some people. Also, delayed eating may reduce total energy/nutrient intake early in the day, which can affect metabolism and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Behavioral and functional implications:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Older adults who have mobility issues, depression, dental problems, or fatigue may find it harder to prepare or access breakfast early, or may simply not feel hungry until later. These health challenges themselves are risk factors for mortality. Thus, breakfast time might be a marker rather than just a lever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What you should do: &lt;keyword id="3045780" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="longevity-hacks" source="Orion"&gt;Longevity hacks&lt;/keyword&gt; and practical tips&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to use this insight to support better health (especially as you age), here are some simple, actionable recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Eat breakfast earlier, close to when you wake up:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Try to have breakfast within one to two hours after waking. If you wake at 6-7 AM, aim for breakfast by 8-9 AM rather than delaying until late morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Maintain consistent mealtimes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just like sleep, being regular with when you eat helps your body expect food, regulate hormones, digestion, and energy levels. A schedule like breakfast around 7-9 AM, lunch around noon, dinner before 6-8 PM can help anchor your day. Missing or delaying meals often disrupts the rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Prioritize breakfast quality:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; What you eat matters. A protein-rich, fiber-full breakfast helps stabilize blood sugar, supports digestion, and gives staying power. Think eggs + veggies, oatmeal with nuts/fruit, yogurt with seeds, whole grain toast + protein. Skipping or having sugary breakfast items may give quick energy but less sustained benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Look after sleep and wake patterns:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since late chronotype, poor sleep, or delayed wake times are associated with eating late, improving sleep hygiene can help. Going to bed earlier, maintaining consistent wake-up times, and limiting exposure to screens before bed – all of these help reset internal clocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Monitor health signs and routines:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you notice fatigue, depression, difficulty preparing meals, oral health problems, or gradually delaying meals, these may be early warning signs worth discussing with your healthcare provider. Mealtime shifts may be easier to track than many other health markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Avoid heavy meals close to bedtime:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eating dinner too late or snacking heavily late in the evening can further skew your eating window and may compound the negative effects of a late breakfast. Light dinners, earlier evenings, and minimizing snacking can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 00:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwJBVV95cUxNbzRSN1lGekk2eVdDbFREOTdPUUM3U0hwNlBFSVlQRTRXUlU1RTNzVW9qWk80a3JJOU1vd3AxM3pnZVg4RWhWbFVRZE4wNTVTYzg3akRPNWpITmNrU1o0cWRxN2U0SldqaFM4ai1tRGhOMkkxQllQdnFSUWNzTHJKOUhOVTIyQzR2QnQtMjZLdXhuYkZMdVpmMzAzd29xaVFkSlViVnFVZ2wzSGVlN0ZNSF91TlM0MDlzSlQ5WGJYWDR1TFUxM3FQeXo2NVNPbngzYmIyYTZjNUlSTzhzUXJITmEweHVjLWxIdmdmWjdvQkw2TmR0cHZzc0tiVzBvMEppSzJqc0pDQkNIeFZNNDk1T0VkOVh5aHY2YjRNeDdPV1paaE5TOG45M05SRnNYQzA</guid></item><item><title>权衡激素治疗更年期的益处和风险，因为FDA考虑删除“黑匣子”警告- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hrt-for-menopause-risks-benefits-fda-black-box-warnings/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hot flashes and sleepless nights are just some of the symptoms of perimenopause that have been disrupting Isabel Kallman's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 53 years old, Kallman's hormones naturally started to decline, and the only medication available for her is menopause hormone therapy. For women experiencing the lead-up to menopause, hormone therapy treatment can involve using estrogen to help alleviate symptoms — but Kallman said she has been on the fence about it due to so-called "black box" labels on the medication, warning of the risk for stroke, blood clots, dementia and breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kallman told CBS News she has been using "Fanny," a handheld fan that she keeps in her bag to help with some of her symptoms. But now she's considering hormone replacement as the Food and Drug Administration weighs removing some of the health warnings for &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hormone-therapy-breast-cancer-risk-study/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;certain treatments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mary Rosser, who has been Kallman's doctor for five years, said she believes flawed research from more than 20 years ago overstated the risks of breast cancer because it focused on older women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been overblown," Dr. Rosser, the director of Integrated Women's Health at Columbia University Irving Medical Center/NewYork-Presbyterian, told CBS News.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2002 &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/shifting-world-of-womens-health/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Women's Health Initiative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the largest long-term study on women's health at the time, focused on older women who may not have started hormone replacement therapy until 10 or so years after going through &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/menopause-grown-woman-talk-obgyn/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which raised safety concerns and led to a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hormone-therapy-menopause-slow-aging/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;longtime public misunderstanding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; around hormone therapy, has since been found problematic in terms of how it was designed, according to Dr. Céline Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News. Now, health care professionals say factors such as age and dosing contribute to the safety of the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recent studies show that timing of treatment matters — a woman's age when she begins menopause hormone therapy, along with the delivery method, can substantially mitigate risks, Gounder says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's "an example of [how] science evolves," Gounder said of recent studies. Hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for a lot of perimenopausal symptoms, according to Gounder, who stressed that patients need to sit down with their doctors to determine what is right for them.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, treatment should start as close to the patient's final menstrual period and continue until about the age of 60, Dr. Rosser says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have to look at your risk and calculate your risk score," Dr. Rosser told Kallman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rosser has spent the past nine months working through the &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/study-shows-hormone-therapy-can-benefit-womens-health-during-menopause/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt; and risks with her patient, who has a family history of breast cancer. While Kallman said she's still hesitant, she realizes hormone therapy may be her best chance at relief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm hoping that there is an opportunity for me to do it," Kallman told CBS News, adding that she hopes there's an option that will help her in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One type of treatment is low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy. Others include whole-body therapy like &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pill-hot-flashes-women-menopause/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;pills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, patches, sprays, gels or a vaginal ring that deliver doses of hormones into the bloodstream at levels high enough to have significant effects on symptoms such as hot flashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As experts like Dr. Rosser continue to have conversations about how to present the treatment's pros and cons, an FDA-assembled panel has stressed the benefits and suggested health warnings be removed from at least some versions. However, dozens of experts called for more input before making any changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A letter signed by 76 doctors and researchers argues that "removing label warnings without adequate scientific assessment puts patients at risk," The Associated Press reported. The group asked the FDA to hold an advisory committee meeting with a public hearing before making any changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rosser said she sees it as a step in the right direction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a public health priority, and this is a sign that the FDA sees that," she told CBS News.&lt;/p&gt;

Nurrobi&lt;/a&gt; of the Department of Cardiology and Vascular Medicine at &lt;a href="https://rspb.ihc.id/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Pertamina Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in Balikpapan, Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-walking-heart-health-and-longevity"&gt;Walking, heart health, and longevity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetics did not cancel out the effect of walking pace. In a large study, researchers found that people who moved at a slower pace and also carried a high polygenic risk score faced the greatest likelihood of developing coronary disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of sluggish gait and unfavorable genetic profile produced the highest risk levels, showing that these two factors reinforce each other rather than replace one another. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the results confirmed that both &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/walking-each-day-at-any-speed-lowers-the-risk-of-cancer/"&gt;walking pace&lt;/a&gt; and genetic predisposition made independent contributions to risk prediction, which improves when walking pace is counted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research highlights that lifestyle choices and inherited traits each matter when it comes to heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A UK Biobank &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/publications/walking-pace-improves-all-cause-and-cardiovascular-mortality-risk-prediction-a-uk-biobank-prognostic-study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; reported that walking pace improves heart and other early mortality risk predictions beyond common measures, which helps clinicians sort risk better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-much-is-enough-for-real-life"&gt;How much is enough for real life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adults need at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity a week, such as 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week,” stated the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; guidelines. A 20 to 30 minute brisk walk most days gets you there without scheduling gymnastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderate intensity means your breathing and heart rate are clearly up, but you can sustain the effort. Short on time, you can split walking into two 10 to 15 minute bouts and still check the box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily routines are easier to keep than heroic goals. Pick a start time you can guard, like after lunch or before dinner, and make that slot non negotiable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-walking-pace-and-heart-health"&gt;Walking pace and heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A systematic review of randomized trials in healthy adults found that exercise training increases heart rate variability, a marker of flexible autonomic control that is linked with better cardiac outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brisk &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/to-get-fit-and-stay-healthy-walk-this-exact-distance-every-day/"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; is an aerobic stimulus that can nudge the heart and cardiovascular system in the right direction when practiced regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2022 review found that physical activity serves as an effective strategy for lowering cortisol levels. Reduced cortisol is associated with steadier mood, improved sleep, and less strain on the body systems that manage stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pace also shapes how your blood vessels behave and helps your muscles pull more sugar and fat out of the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over weeks, those changes support healthier &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/standing-still-exercises-beat-running-for-blood-pressure-control/"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and cholesterol profiles, which is one reason walking shows up in prevention and recovery plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-the-risk-drop-is-plausible"&gt;Why the risk drop is plausible&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dog-walking-improves-mobility-and-prevents-falls-in-older-adults/"&gt;Walking&lt;/a&gt; taps large muscle groups in a rhythmic way, so circulation becomes more efficient with practice. That consistency trains the vessels to relax more easily and the heart to do the same job with less strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy use rises during and after the walk. Over time, that improves insulin sensitivity, and better insulin signaling supports stable blood sugar and less inflammatory activity tied to artery damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nervous system matters too. When heart rate variability improves, it signals a stronger parasympathetic brake and a calmer response to daily stress, which lowers strain on the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-pace-without-gadgets"&gt;How to pace without gadgets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use landmarks and a clock. If you are covering about a mile in 15 to 20 minutes and can hold that pace for your whole walk, you are in a useful zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep your stride relaxed and your arms moving naturally. If you notice your pace slipping near the end, shorten the stride a bit and stay smooth rather than pushing into a sprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hills, stairs, and wind will change effort. Adjust your pace to keep effort steady across terrain, and let the tougher parts build fitness without forcing breathless bursts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-keeping-the-habit-when-life-is-messy"&gt;Keeping the habit when life is messy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anchor the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/walk-20-minutes-daily-to-boost-your-brain-power/"&gt;walk&lt;/a&gt; to a daily cue, like finishing a morning coffee or closing your laptop at a set time. Habits tied to a cue survive busy days because you do not have to renegotiate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a bad weather plan. Indoor corridors, covered malls, or a safe loop near home keep the chain unbroken when the sky does not cooperate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have chest pain, unexplained shortness of breath, or dizziness during exertion, talk with a clinician before pushing pace. The goal is steady practice, not heroics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pace and regularity are the levers you control. A brisk 20 to 30 minute walk most days can shift your odds in a meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Promoting a faster &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/squats-vs-walking-the-definitive-winner-for-reducing-blood-sugar/"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; pace as a daily activity may effectively mitigate the burden of CAD,” wrote Nurrobi. The signal appears consistently across different groups and remains strong even after accounting for genetic risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11043612/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cureus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 22:03:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNVDN4dEU5OVNlWmVGUXpZR3Nrb1dlVWwtQXRBd1ZablFRaTBRZ3ZHN0ItRmZGbEFRU0sxNmRoeEt2aDNzR1dIWmJEaThlVnpMMUxMYlpNOWNraDdrMWc1RVpfMHUxZWx1ZC1udzZ2ZFBzUkVTMmlSU1B4QW1XaVhBSWJqczVzaXFCR1hvdDdmT3JVT2xUMUYtYWtzQ3IxVTZrVjlGRUhjR08</guid></item><item><title>特朗普的哈佛削减威胁到生物医学研究界的一个巨人：关于微小果蝇的数据库- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/trumps-harvard-cuts-threaten-giant-biomedical-research-community-datab-rcna230610</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dcd112" class="body-graf"&gt;For more than a century, the humble fruit fly has paved the way for many critical scientific breakthroughs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ab564c" class="body-graf"&gt;This tiny insect helped researchers figure out that X-rays can cause genetic mutations. That genes are passed on from parent to child through &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1933/summary/" target="_blank"&gt;chromosomes&lt;/a&gt;. That a &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2017/press-release/" target="_blank"&gt;gene called period&lt;/a&gt; helps our bodies keep time — and that disruptions to that internal clock can lead to jet lag and increased risk for neurological and metabolic diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-39c94e" class="body-graf"&gt;Those discoveries, along with nearly 90,000 other studies, are part of a key online database called FlyBase that researchers routinely use to help them more quickly design new experiments. These tests explore the underlying causes of disease and could help with the development of new treatments. Science builds on prior insights, and a handy repository of past advances serves as kindling for future discoveries.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-02c461" class="body-graf"&gt;The website receives about 770,000 page views each month from scientists working around the world on &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(21)00180-2" target="_blank"&gt;developing personalized therapies&lt;/a&gt; for rare cancers, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/201/2/377/5930058" target="_blank"&gt;modeling human neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ahg.12554" target="_blank"&gt;screening drug candidates for conditions like Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1fc638" class="body-graf"&gt;Now, that critical resource is on the brink of layoffs that endanger its future and ability to make research more efficient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c2c4cc" class="body-graf"&gt;This spring, the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Trump administration, as part of its broader $2.2 billion funding cuts at Harvard University, rescinded a grant used to maintain FlyBase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ae9a85" class="body-graf"&gt;“I use FlyBase every single day. It’s so essential,” said Celeste Berg, a professor of genome sciences at the University of Washington, who is not part of the team that operates FlyBase. “What we know about human genes and how they function comes almost completely from model systems like drosophila.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8d1035" class="body-graf"&gt;Humans share about 60% of our genes with fruit flies, also known by their scientific name &lt;em&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ea3100" class="body-graf"&gt;FlyBase’s now-uncertain future highlights just how interconnected and interdependent research efforts are and how the effects of funding cuts to one institution can ripple worldwide. More than 4,000 labs use FlyBase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c60506" class="body-graf"&gt;Harvard was receiving about $2 million a year in federal funding to maintain FlyBase, which was the vast majority of the website’s total operating budget. But the University of New Mexico, Indiana University and the University of Cambridge in England are partners that help Harvard manage FlyBase and are beneficiaries, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-453ac6" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is not just affecting Harvard,” said Brian Calvi, a professor of biology at Indiana University, who is part of the FlyBase management team. “The ripple effect is to the international biomedical research community.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c9dcbb" class="body-graf"&gt;Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences rescued FlyBase with interim funding, but that support will cease in October, according to Norbert Perrimon, a professor of developmental biology at Harvard Medical School. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-af2643" class="body-graf"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/judge-orders-trump-administration-unfreeze-nearly-22-billion-federal-g-rcna228926" target="_blank"&gt;judge earlier this month ordered the Trump administration to restore funding&lt;/a&gt; to Harvard researchers who lost grants, but money has not begun to flow to FlyBase, Perrimon said. The administration has promised to appeal the decision, which could halt the flow of funds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-219b4a" class="body-graf"&gt;The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the National Institutes of Health, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e0dd35" class="body-graf"&gt;The Transmitter, a neuroscience news site, &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.thetransmitter.org/community/harvard-university-lays-off-fly-database-team/__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!uF_mslZG8c0kkW2n_ojZOpLFIRPvNSfqv6-3-pbt6-RvAE2bVt8Jn5BxGr7eQwUclBAlt8XyAnFu7G6jnPSfzhMChhdd$" target="_blank"&gt;first reported about layoffs at FlyBase&lt;/a&gt;. The Harvard Crimson reported about the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/9/9/flybase-funding/__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!uF_mslZG8c0kkW2n_ojZOpLFIRPvNSfqv6-3-pbt6-RvAE2bVt8Jn5BxGr7eQwUclBAlt8XyAnFu7G6jnPSfzm6clJ6W$" target="_blank"&gt;decision not to continue with interim funding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5294de" class="body-graf"&gt;Calvi said the FlyBase grant provided full or partial salary for eight people at Harvard, three at Indiana, five at Cambridge and one at the University of New Mexico. Both Indiana and Cambridge were able to secure funds to keep their portion of the program operating into next year. The New Mexico position ended in August. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7deafd" class="body-graf"&gt;FlyBase, which has been operating since 1992, has received federal support for more than three decades. It curates and summarizes research papers, organizes findings about particular genes, and catalogs information about fruit flies that have been modified genetically to tease apart how certain genes guide normal development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-817034" class="body-graf"&gt;Fruit flies are among the most important animal models for biomedical research because scientists have been able to map their genomes and brains. They’re also relatively easy and cheap to handle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-277cb2" class="body-graf"&gt;Berg, the genome sciences professor and avid FlyBase user, studies human development and how cells form organs. FlyBase allows her to search and identify genes of interest for experiments. She then tests how changing the expression of those genes affects the arrangement of cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4520d0" class="body-graf"&gt;Every year, thousands of fruit fly papers are added to FlyBase and summarized. Without FlyBase, Berg said researchers and clinicians would struggle to keep up and could miss key connections about particular genes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-56f6fc" class="body-graf"&gt;Researchers with the &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://undiagnosed.hms.harvard.edu/research/model-organisms-phase-ii/__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!uF_mslZG8c0kkW2n_ojZOpLFIRPvNSfqv6-3-pbt6-RvAE2bVt8Jn5BxGr7eQwUclBAlt8XyAnFu7G6jnPSfzqmPDx5s$" target="_blank"&gt;Undiagnosed Diseases Network&lt;/a&gt; use FlyBase to help identify whether genetic mutations in children could be contributing to rare and unexplained diseases. The scientists identify genetic variants in these patients and then compare those mutations to past research of those genes in flies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-54a947" class="body-graf"&gt;FlyBase is now crowdfunding support on its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9b19b3" class="body-graf"&gt;“Given the importance of FlyBase to the broader U.S. and international scientific research community, we are hopeful other institutions and other stakeholders at Harvard will support those efforts,” said James Chisholm, a spokesman for Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences, adding that several Harvard departments were “actively working to identify and secure additional funding to safeguard FlyBase’s operations.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b03d63" class="body-graf"&gt;Two Harvard-based staffers have already been laid off from their work at FlyBase, and another six are scheduled for layoffs later in September and in early October, Perrimon said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2001d5" class="body-graf"&gt;“If we cannot retain the key personnel, it’s going to be very difficult to get back those people who have knowledge to keep the databases running,” Perrimon said. “That would be the point of no return for FlyBase.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c1d4b5" class="body-graf"&gt;The funding disruption is also threatening plans to move FlyBase’s data to a new long-term home called the Alliance of Genome Resources. Fruit flies are among several common “model organisms,” along with rats, mice and worms, that are used in laboratories and lay the groundwork for understanding human biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3b5cc3" class="body-graf"&gt;The National Institutes of Health has spent about &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://reporter.nih.gov/search/aP_gy-lZWES6IOBy6zZN3A/project-details/10976322__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!uF_mslZG8c0kkW2n_ojZOpLFIRPvNSfqv6-3-pbt6-RvAE2bVt8Jn5BxGr7eQwUclBAlt8XyAnFu7G6jnPSfzh8OYkhq$" target="_blank"&gt;$5 million a year since 2017&lt;/a&gt; to merge several databases, including FlyBase, WormBase and the Mouse Genome Database, among a handful of others. Each contains information that human health researchers can cross-reference to study genes important for human health more efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-25e41c" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you’re studying human genes and you have to study everything that’s known, you have to go to all of these [websites] and learn the system,” said Paul Sternberg, a professor of biology at the California Institute of Technology, who is leading the Alliance effort. “We want one-stop shopping.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fe1314" class="body-graf"&gt;The Alliance’s budget expired June 30, and Sternberg said he is awaiting a funding renewal decision from NIH himself. He said the funding disruption at FlyBase represents a new, unexpected obstacle to making&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;research findings more useful and easier to scour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fcf2e0" class="body-graf"&gt;“We need to do this fast, but when you’re losing staff and energy, that’s what makes it dicey,” Sternberg said. “Don’t throw extra roadblocks. That’s all we ask.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b0b8ac" class="body-graf"&gt;FlyBase had planned to merge with the Alliance in 2029. Now, Calvi and others are pushing for a speedier merger, before FlyBase’s financial runway runs out. The donations the organization is seeking are meant to help pay for that.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-25a327" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“So far it’s less than $100,000,” Calvi said of the organization’s crowdfunding efforts. “We probably need a million.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 22:00:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixAFBVV95cUxPalpqTE1rZzkyaXg0S2c3blZkQzVWRWdpaXF6RHJhRXlzZlVwbXcxZ2J6emdwV2JOUnp5eEUxZ0RKenNVSWU1ZDMtNmVGXzU5OW55UV8tVW4wUmpmOFI1TnNoQTVSdXBsTzlHR1BabWZrbW5lRjJxZzZ5bmMyY2Vxb21aWUtDLVBTSmNGejNYZnZTLVZIRVFXaElHNG95TWdEWFpGbmQtbEhHR2ZxdjJTUW50bXNGc0tIYXlHZXNhRlVUa1dR0gFWQVVfeXFMTm00eEdrdktyLUdBZXJLcVFiNWdYNklpNkxyUUNNRzd2WVRLcEtFRzdFbU9nMjdtX3VKZkVzU0JxdW9fSUg5UWppU2JBSTg2VFdIeXlpQkE</guid></item><item><title>为什么加州大学旧金山分校的医生说放宽新的CT辐射规则将是一个“挫折” -旧金山纪事报</title><link>https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/cms-ct-radiation-rule-21037689.php</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="rel"&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:-mx40 lg:-mx56 x100vw sm:cw-80 lg:cw-112 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal regulators are considering rolling back a rule that requires hospitals to track and report the amount of radiation they use in CT scans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;FS Productions/Getty Images/Tetra images RF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal regulators may soon roll back a &lt;a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/CMS-2025-0306-0002" data-link="native" class=""&gt;rule&lt;/a&gt; that requires hospitals to track and report the amount of radiation they use in CT scans — but not if the UCSF radiologist who created a key measure in the rule, which is meant to incentivize lower radiation doses, has anything to say about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman, who for years has studied the link between CT scans and cancer risk, is leading a campaign urging the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency that regulates hospitals, to keep the requirement in place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relaxing the regulation, she says, would gut the only guardrails that hold doctors and hospitals accountable for using appropriate radiation doses in CT scans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="A300" data-large-id="CONCERT1" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh300px lg:ais"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;CT (computed tomography) is a widely used medical imaging technology for assessing many conditions, including whether patients need emergency surgery after car accidents and falls, and whether some cancer treatments are working. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important for hospitals to track and report radiation doses used in CT scans because the technology can be overused and expose patients to higher levels of ionizing radiation, a known carcinogen, than necessary, Smith-Bindman said. The use of CT is on the rise, having increased about 30% since 2007, making the issue of CT radiation exposure and its link to cancer a growing concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regulation in question is a CMS rule that was finalized in 2023 and slated to take effect in 2027. It requires hospital outpatient programs, which include emergency departments, to track and report the amount of radiation they use in CT scans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rule was originally meant to be mandatory for hospitals, but CMS in July proposed &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/calendar-year-2026-hospital-outpatient-prospective-payment-system-opps-and-ambulatory-surgical" data-link="native" class=""&gt;making it voluntary.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because some hospitals have said it may be complex to implement, especially smaller facilities that lack IT capabilities, according to CMS. Making it voluntary would give them more time to integrate and test the measure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT1" data-large-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh300px lg:ais"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making the reporting voluntary would be a “tremendous setback” for patient safety, said Smith-Bindman, who worked with CMS to develop a key measure used in the regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;CMS gave Smith-Bindman and her UCSF team a $5 million grant in 2019 to create the measure to incentivize lower CT radiation doses. There was no technology at the time that would allow hospitals to track and report the measure, which must link electronic health record data with radiology data, Smith-Bindman said. So she and several other co-founders created Alara Imaging, which makes software that performs this function for hospitals for free. She has a minority ownership stake in Alara, along with UCSF and several other co-founders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An expert panel at CMS found Alara was the best way to roll out the measure reliably, and that the measure would lead to reductions in radiation dose, she said. Alara is a for-profit company but does not charge for this software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measure takes into account various factors — including a patient’s size, the body part being imaged, and the reason for the imaging — and sets a cap for what’s considered an appropriate dose of radiation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The program being optional is going to lead to many hospitals not reporting on this measure, which would be such a backslide because that’s what’s really driving adoption,” Smith-Bindman said. “I’m trying to get the word out to say, ‘Yes, we care about CT doses.

Additionally, the software to interface with our electronic medical record might be free from the federal government, but the labor to implement it comes at a great cost, as our CT radiation technology is outsourced to a third party.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others have raised questions about the measure used in the rule, saying it has not been shown to improve patient care and is inconsistent with some internationally recognized standards for CT radiation doses.And some expressed concern that hospitals would have to use Alara Imaging to track and report the data, which presents a potential conflict of interest because Smith-Bindman and UCSF have a stake in the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith-Bindman said it is not a conflict of interest, and that neither she nor Alara stands to gain financially if hospitals use Alara’s free software to implement the CMS rule. Alara is a for-profit company but does not charge for this software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith-Bindman said the measure has been tested at 17 hospital systems, where radiologists found it helped optimize radiation doses, and validated by the National Quality Forum, which sets standards for quality in the health care industry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s long been known that exposure to high doses of radiation causes cancer. This has been shown in studies on Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors and on people exposed to nuclear accidents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether radiation from CT scans causes cancer has not been widely studied in the U.S., though European researchers have found that children who’ve undergone CT scans have a higher risk of some cancers, including leukemia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/ct-scan-cancer-ucsf-study-20271473.php" data-link="native" class=""&gt;recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt; found that CT scans may be more harmful than previously thought, and account for about 5% of new cancer cases annually in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the 93 million CTs performed on 60 million patients in 2023, an estimated 103,000 future cancers are projected to occur, according to the study, which was led by Smith-Bindman. That puts CT scans roughly on par with alcohol consumption and excess body weight in terms of its contribution to cancer risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="S300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children, especially babies, have higher cancer risk from CTs than adults because their cells are more sensitive to radiation and because they have a longer life span within which to develop cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping the CMS rule mandatory will help limit excessive radiation doses and avert 25,000 cancers each year, Smith-Bindman estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>San Francisco Chronicle</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 21:56:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxNck9QTW01TzJMV29jRVl0eXRLQ1pnMEVlSmRhX2w1YldFT0dOcWFaRHpTWXN2RGFRLTVVYWZZekJrUndSc21KXzVVN2ZlSTNnb2NlcTI1d0hRZ0l1T3UtLVNYbkFEcGgydzA1eXd5OUFKdE5ONElET19FTmlfT2pxUGZiUQ</guid></item><item><title>诺和诺德股票（ NVO ）在三剂试验达到19 ％减肥后上涨- TipRanks</title><link>https://www.tipranks.com/news/novo-nordisks-drug-trial-achieves-19-weight-loss-fuels-rivalry-with-eli-lilly</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="R9U5xJmA undefined  h_pxauto fontSize6 fontFamilyregular mobile_mx3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthcare company Novo Nordisk &lt;a data-ticker="NVO" href="https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvo"&gt;(NVO)&lt;/a&gt; has reported promising results from its latest clinical trial for its obesity treatment. Notably, tripling the drug’s dose helped patients achieve significantly more weight loss, strengthening the company’s position as it competes with U.S. rival Eli Lilly &lt;a data-ticker="LLY" href="https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/lly"&gt;(LLY)&lt;/a&gt; in the growing obesity treatment market. Following the trial results, Novo’s U.S.-listed shares were up 1% in pre-market hours on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Elevate Your Investing Strategy:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Take advantage of &lt;a data-link="article_promo" href="https://lp.tipranks.com/july-2025-50off/?llf=rss&amp;amp;timer=on&amp;amp;coupon=INTRO50P"&gt; TipRanks Premium at 50% off! &lt;/a&gt; Unlock powerful investing tools, advanced data, and expert analyst insights to help you invest with confidence.

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For context, Wegovy is Novo Nordisk’s prescription drug for long-term weight management, using the active ingredient semaglutide, which is also sold as Ozempic for diabetes. Meanwhile, Eli Lilly offers Mounjaro and Zepbound, which use tirzepatide for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Novo Nordisk Shows Progress, Yet Trails Eli Lilly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Novo’s two late-stage clinical trials, semaglutide showed strong results in testing a 7.2 mg dose, well above the current approved 2.4 mg dose. In the larger trial, patients lost an average of 19% of their body weight after 72 weeks, compared with 16% on the standard 2.4 mg dose and 4% on a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the results were slightly lower than Eli Lilly’s tirzepatide, which achieved up to 22.5% weight loss at its top approved dose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, experts see value in the incremental gains. Remarkably, Naveed Sattar, a professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow, noted that the extra weight-loss benefit is significant, especially as the cost of high-dose tirzepatide has risen in certain regions. He also pointed out that semaglutide 7.2 mg could offer a more affordable alternative if priced competitively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race for Weight-Loss Market Heats Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The race for the weight-loss drug market is intensifying as Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk compete to capture market share. With recent trial results and new dosing strategies, investors and patients are closely watching how both companies will perform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Novo has lost ground in the U.S. to both Lilly and other copycat drugs, and its shares have dropped 60% over the past year. Most recently, &lt;a href="https://www.tipranks.com/news/novo-nordisk-stock-nvo-under-pressure-as-it-cuts-jobs-and-lowers-outlook"&gt;Novo announced a major restructuring&lt;/a&gt;, reducing its global workforce by 11%, or about 9,000 jobs. Amid these challenges, investors have been hoping that Novo Nordisk would strengthen its pipeline of new obesity drugs, as many view Eli Lilly as offering more options in clinical trials. Even so, the latest data shows that semaglutide can still provide meaningful incremental gains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LLY or NVO: Which Pharma Stock Offers Higher Upside?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;a href="https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/healthcare-stocks"&gt;TipRanks Stock Comparison tool,&lt;/a&gt; we analyzed NVO and LLY to determine which stock offers greater upside potential, according to analysts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to TipRanks, &lt;a href="https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvo"&gt;NVO stock&lt;/a&gt; carries a Moderate Buy rating, with an &lt;a href="https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvo/forecast"&gt;average price target of $67.71,&lt;/a&gt; implying a 23.4% upside from current levels. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/lly"&gt;LLY stock&lt;/a&gt; holds a Strong Buy rating, supported by 16 Buys and 4 Holds. &lt;a href="https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/lly/forecast"&gt;Eli Lilly’s average price target of $913.69&lt;/a&gt; suggests an upside of 21% potential gain.&lt;/p&gt;

The research adds to prior reports of spikes in &lt;a href="https://openheart.bmj.com/content/1/1/e000019" data-link="native" class=""&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/apl9451317.pdf" data-link="native" class=""&gt;injuries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32008905/" data-link="native" class=""&gt;traffic crashes&lt;/a&gt; after people lose an hour of sleep when daylight saving time starts in March. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first real piece of evidence that staying in permanent standard time would be better, from a biological perspective, than either permanent daylight saving time or the current shift twice per year,” said &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/jamie-zeitzer" data-link="native" class=""&gt;Jamie Zeitzer&lt;/a&gt;, Ph.D., a Stanford psychiatry and behavioral sciences professor and the study’s senior author. “Until now, we’ve just had theories.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zeitzer and his colleague found major health benefits to ending the spring forward from standard time to daylight saving time. Using mathematical models and data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the researchers estimated that sticking with standard time all year would prevent about 300,000 strokes annually and lead to 2.6 million fewer people with obesity nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key reason our seasonal time shifts are so damaging is how they impact our circadian rhythms, the internal clocks that regulate most body processes and are vital to a functioning immune system and sleep cycle. Out-of-whack circadian rhythms are linked to a wide range of health issues, including stroke and obesity. One way circadian rhythms get scrambled is by being exposed to light at the wrong time: morning light can help body clocks stay synchronized, while evening light can slow them down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md:pt16 md:sy16 md:bb md:bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class="vh y0 mb0 md:vv md:y100 md:mb16"&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="NTV7ARD" data-large-id="Inline-2" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the best analogy is that your circadian clock is acting in the body like a conductor acts in an orchestra,” Zeitzer said. “With a weak conductor, it might still sound fine in the violin section or the flute section, but the audience hears a cacophony. And that’s what happens in the body, too, with everything just a little bit off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists looked at the three possible time policies based on how they affect light exposure and impact circadian rhythms and overall health throughout the year. They found permanent standard time was best overall, permanent daylight saving time was second, and our current practice of switching back and forth was the absolute worst. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings varied a bit based on region and between night owls and morning larks. Those who like to stay up later (you know who you are) bear the greater negative health effects of the seasonal time switching. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-1" data-large-id="Inline-3" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/657584/half-daylight-saving-time-sunsetted.aspx" data-link="native" class=""&gt;widespread dislike&lt;/a&gt; for the more-than-&lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Daylight-Saving-Time" data-link="native" class=""&gt;century&lt;/a&gt;-old institution of daylight saving time, the best alternative option remains up for &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/does-daylight-saving-time-make-sense-scientists-debate-pros-and-cons" data-link="native" class=""&gt;debate&lt;/a&gt;. Health organizations like the &lt;a href="https://aasm.org/" data-link="native" class=""&gt;American Academy of Sleep Medicine&lt;/a&gt; support standard time, in favor of more morning light. Meanwhile, bills proposing permanent daylight saving time, which means more evening light, &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/139" data-link="native" class=""&gt;hit&lt;/a&gt; Congress nearly every year, but have yet to pass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The way they modeled this study is genius,” said Joanna Fong-Isariyawongse, a neurologist at the University of Pittsburgh who focuses on sleep medicine but wasn’t involved in the study. “We know that we should end the twice-yearly shifts, but there’s this argument about which way we should go.
