All three were hospitalized and are now recovering, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR25-015.aspx" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;California department of public health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Mpox is a viral infection that often begins with flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills and muscle aches. These are usually followed by a rash that starts as small raised spots, then develop into fluid-filled blisters before forming scabs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The virus has two main genetic groups, or “clades”. Clade I mpox has caused widespread disease and deaths in parts of central and east Africa, most acutely in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Clade II was the strain behind the 2022 US outbreak, which has circulated at low levels since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The presence of clade I needs careful evaluation,” said Seth Blumberg, an associate professor of medicine at the University of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, San Francisco’s division of infectious diseases and hospital medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I don’t think the historical results we’ve seen from Africa are directly translatable, but we need to monitor these cases closely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Rita Nguyen, assistant state public health officer, said in Friday’s statement that “clade I mpox cases can be severe” and the “risk of severe disease and hospitalization are highest for people with weakened immune systems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s critical to protect yourself by getting both doses of the mpox vaccine if you or your sex partner(s) may be at risk for mpox,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Anyone can contract mpox through close physical contact, including sex. Past outbreaks of clade II &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/05/lgbt-groups-unite-to-urge-uk-ministers-to-act-against-monkeypox" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;primarily affected&lt;/a&gt; gay and bisexual men and transgender or non-binary people who have sex with men. California’s public health department now believes person-to-person spread of clade I is occurring in California, mainly affecting these communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In Long Beach, officials &lt;a href="https://www.longbeach.gov/press-releases/city-of-long-beach-confirms-first-case-of-clade-i-mpox/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;announced the first case&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2023/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;six prior US clade I cases&lt;/a&gt;, all linked to travel abroad. The first was detected in San Mateo county in 2024. Officials said the overall risk to the public remains low, and casual contact in settings like offices or public transit is unlikely to spread the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Jynneos vaccine protects against both clade I and II mpox. It is a two-dose series given a month apart, with full immunity reached two weeks after the second dose. No booster is currently recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Vaccination doesn’t completely eliminate the risk of contracting mpox, but experts say it helps reduce severity if a person were to contract the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The vaccines are completely protective,” Blumberg said. “Vaccines can prevent the severity of disease. If you were to get mpox, you would be less likely to need advanced care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC said it is not known how long vaccine protection might last, or if protection might decrease over time, according to its &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/vaccines/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. The public health agency is analyzing the current data and conducting studies to better understand how the Jynneos vaccine works amid the current mpox outbreak, as well as how long protection might last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 20:41:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxOWUJnS0N0RFJiUWd5UWUwWlY0a2FKeV9OUFhfRDZqdVloa0sxVlJsdThNcGNQWnV3eWYtUGR0TzdNRndjVzFObDdnb0RxcmZpemx6bGFCTWpZTXNVM0NLYzdiTm1yZExta1JHTVVheElBbkVpaDQ4WF9MWTNlYVBvdl8xcG5MOHdyMGc</guid></item><item><title>新的研究发现，母乳喂养妇女的保护性免疫细胞被确定为预防乳腺癌</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/21/protective-immune-cells-breastfeeding-guard-against-cancer</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the 18th century, physicians noticed nuns had some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/oct/06/cancer.women" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;highest rates of breast cancer.&lt;/a&gt; It was one of the earliest clues that led scientists to suspect that child-bearing and breastfeeding could protect against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Modern data has confirmed the centuries-old observation but the biological reasons behind it have remained unclear. Explanations have often focused on pregnancy-related hormonal changes, but research &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09713-5" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published Tuesday in Nature&lt;/a&gt; has found breastfeeding provides long-lasting immune protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Sherene Loi, a clinician scientist at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, said the most sophisticated level of the immune system, called the adaptive immune system, involves T-cells which react against particular viruses or bacteria – and also against cancer. This response is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/06/cancer-cure-immunotherapy" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;“one of our very modern therapeutic weapons against cancer”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Loi, the senior author of the new study, said her team had noticed some breast cancers had large amounts of these specialised immune cells, while others had very few.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="a21567b7-aac0-40d8-9c02-62cb0cc93b00" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Women who miss first breast cancer screening at ‘40% higher risk’ of dying from the disease","elementId":"a21567b7-aac0-40d8-9c02-62cb0cc93b00","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/24/women-who-miss-first-breast-cancer-screening-at-40-higher-risk-of-dying-from-the-disease"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Patients who had more cells had better outcomes, particularly for one of the most aggressive types: triple-negative breast cancer. These immune cells were also found in healthy breast tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study sought to investigate why these T-cells were already there, whether they were related to pregnancy and breastfeeding, and if they protected against breast cancer formation and growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers studied noncancerous breast tissue of more than 260 women from diverse populations who had breast reductions or surgery to reduce their risk of breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They found those who had children had more of these specialised cells, called CD8⁺ T-cells. These cells remained in the breasts for more than 30 years after pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Using mice models, the researchers then implanted cancerous cells into the equivalent of their breast tissue, and found they grew less in the mice that had had pups and breastfed, than in virgin mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When they depleted the T-cells from the mice with pups, they lost the protection. This suggested the T-cells were directly responsible for the effect, Loi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers then investigated whether women who breastfed lived longer with triple-negative breast cancer. They looked at studies involving more than&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;1,000 breast cancer patients diagnosed after having children, and had a record of their breastfeeding history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They found that women who had breastfed did better from their triple-negative breast cancer than those who had not. Their tumours also had more immune cells, suggesting there was ongoing immune activation and regulation from the body against their breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The key take-home messages [are] that pregnancy and breastfeeding will leave behind long-lived protective immune cells in the breast and the body, and these cells help to reduce risk and improve defence against breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer, but potentially other cancers as well as disease,” Loi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Loi said the study provided an explanation why breastfeeding is protective, so that it can be used in the future to try to recreate this effect in women who don’t have children or are unable to breastfeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Understanding the biological mechanism could help develop vaccines and new strategies to mimic this protection, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She emphasised even if women do breastfeed, it’s not a 100% guarantee that they won’t get breast cancer. “The effects are really quite small for every individual, but population wide the effects are large.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Associate Prof Wendy Ingman from the University of Adelaide’s Medical School said the longer the duration of breastfeeding, the greater the benefits. She said, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9972148/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;for every year of breastfeeding, there is a 4% lifetime reduction&lt;/a&gt; in the mother’s breast cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This study shows that having babies and breastfeeding causes long-lasting changes in immune cells that could help protect the breast from cancer,” she said. “I’m hopeful that this type of research will lead to new approaches to reduce women’s breast cancer risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 20:20:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNZ0JJQVdCenlRVWhFVzNTVE5QSGp3U08xLVZCRUNHZ1JHWXI2X2VNdGQ3S1BOX2dHZ2MwN3JXNjFFaW83cDR0RVpHY1RqNWhZczRsVjJpbWh3OGhVcEJyYzNPN2l1MGtCdDZXU2NjNml3eWt4czlDaG10MXZFYS1DZ3o1QTBSRUQyN1pRa0ZiZ3pxZjRrNkJRcEpVaTZSZDZ1aFlQWjduNXJnR3QxTy0wMWtpRQ</guid></item><item><title>盲人患者再次阅读智能眼镜植入物- The Verge</title><link>https://www.theverge.com/news/802905/eye-implant-smart-glasses-restores-vision</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Several dozen patients with vision loss due to a progressive form of blindness called age-related macular degeneration (AMD) regained some of their central vision thanks to an eye implant paired with a set of smart glasses. The &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2501396"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; was published Monday in &lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, and researchers &lt;a href="https://science.xyz/news/new-england-journal-of-medicine-prima/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; that patients could see well enough using the technology to fill out crossword puzzles and read regular books again. Participants included people aged 60 or older with diagnosed AMD in both eyes, and visual impairment of a measured visual acuity of at least 1.2 logMAR or worse in the study eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;AMD cannot be reversed because cells in the center of the patients’ retinas die over time. The study focused on restoring some of that lost vision using a 2-by-2-millimeter device made of tiny photovoltaic solar panels. The device was surgically implanted under the retina in the patient’s eye. Patients wore camera-equipped smart glasses, which transmitted zoomed-in images of the world to the retinal implant using near infrared light. The retinal implant then pulsed small electrical signals into the optic nerve, mimicking what the cells of the retina would normally do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;The study started off with 38 patients who received the retinal implant, 32 of whom stayed in the clinical trial for a full year. At the one year mark, 26 of the 32 participants could see better than when they started — an &lt;a href="https://science.xyz/news/new-england-journal-of-medicine-prima/"&gt;80 percent success rate&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not perfect; patients can only see a blurry vision of the world and only in black and white. But researchers uninvolved in the study called the work “amazing,” as &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/20/health/retinal-implant-macular-degeneration.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;The technology comes from the brain-computer interface company Science Corporation, whose founder and CEO, &lt;a href="https://science.xyz/company/team/max-hodak/"&gt;Max Hodak&lt;/a&gt;, cofounded Neuralink in 2016 with Elon Musk. Science Corporation acquired the retinal implant technology from the French medical device company Pixium Vision in 2024 after it ran out of money after a decade of working to develop the vision technology, as &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/pixium-bionic-eye-tech-rescued"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;IEEE Spectrum&lt;/em&gt;.

                                        &lt;p&gt;ATLANTA (AP) — CDC researchers are being forced to skip a pivotal conference on infectious disease this week due to the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/government-shutdown-congress-trump-health-care-54b2a584657a0b619bc8326708a05604"&gt;government shutdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, missing out on high-level discussions not long after surges in &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-us-texas-mmr-vaccine-rfk-144ed193e13de675a750e52a505423e9"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and whooping cough hit the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDWeek, the largest annual meeting of infectious disease experts in the nation, is the leading venue for experts to trade information about diagnosing, treating and preventing threats including bird flu, superbugs and HIV, among many other topics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC typically sends scores of researchers and outbreak investigators. But of the hundreds of speakers listed in the printed program for the four-day conference, about 10 were identified as CDC scientists. And even that small number didn’t show up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main reason is the government shutdown that started Oct. 1. Federal scientists aren’t being paid and conference appearances are postponed unless they are funded outside of annual government budgets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Problems were apparent long before the shutdown&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Infectious Disease Society of America and its conference partners selected Atlanta, where the CDC is based, as its host more than a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizers were excited to have the meeting in “the heart of public health,” and CDC officials agreed to be heavily involved in planning, said Dr. Yohei Doi, a University of Pittsburgh researcher who helped organize the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But soon after President Donald Trump’s inauguration, there was an immediate, if temporary, freeze on CDC communications and participation at medical meetings. That was followed by layoffs and research funding cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As things started to evolve, they said they no longer would be able to attend,” Doi said of CDC speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Disease threats are looming&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s absence comes as infectious disease specialists should be in high demand, in part because the worst pandemic in a century hit only a few years ago. Measles and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/whooping-cough-pertussis-tdap-vaccination-outbreak-eb8f4776fdd0796ad789aac1ccdc9b67"&gt;whooping cough&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have been surging. And new threats are constantly emerging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said he wants the CDC to primarily focus on infectious diseases, though he was a leading voice in the antivaccine movement before Trump appointed him to lead the federal government’s health agencies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC has already lost a quarter of its workforce through layoffs, buyouts, resignations and other actions. And the Trump administration is trying to lay off hundreds more, an effort temporarily &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/government-shutdown-layoffs-trump-unions-b312b3ca77cbdbc72e778ece3b2cbffc"&gt;blocked by a federal judge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s the most painful irony of all” to see these actions by the administration amid serious threats, said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osterholm, who spoke at the conference Sunday, said he is working with others to take on work that &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-vaccine-recommendations-data-b4eeba69e03a8d4ed50fb0a12fbcec6e"&gt;the CDC has curtailed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He announced a new open-access publication called Public Health Alerts to put out the kind of reports that were the staple of the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, a collaboration involving dozens of foundations would pool resources to fund some of the disease research work that the government has stopped doing, Osterholm said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is not business as usual anymore, but it doesn’t mean that we have to sit back and take it,” Osterholm said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Conference sponsor has clashed with Kennedy &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;HHS &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccine-committee-cdc-cfbdcab84b2a919a6131d471959c3431"&gt;has discouraged federal collaborations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with some medical organizations, including IDSA, and that likely had a chilling effect, said Dr. Debra Houry, who was the CDC’s chief medical officer until &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-monarez-firing-c31fd1b880cbc709a1adf6cd7ff22b1b"&gt;she resigned in August&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to protest agency changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A HHS spokeswoman, Emily Hilliard, said the administration believes federal scientists should share their research and expertise with peers and the public, and that conferences are vetted “to ensure compliance with ethics rules and the responsible use of taxpayer funds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Anna Yousaf, a CDC infectious disease doctor, told The Associated Press she was invited to present findings about long-term outcomes of COVID-19-infected children who develop a rare inflammatory condition. She wasn’t allowed to attend this week’s conference, though a collaborator at another organization was planning to share the research, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other CDC scientists were in similar predicaments, she said, and it’s not clear how many of them could find such a workaround. That potentially means some research findings won’t be shared with researchers and physicians who could put the information to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This 30-day plan is set at 1,800 calories, with modifications for 1,500 and 2,000 calories.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Each day provides at least 80 grams of protein and 30 grams of fiber, both of which promote satiety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This plan prioritizes foods linked to reducing inflammation, like healthy fats, fish, fermented foods and colorful fruits and vegetables.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In this 30-day high-protein, high-fiber anti-inflammatory plan, you’ll find a month of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-fiber-fruits-to-eat-11747635" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-fiber fruits&lt;/a&gt; and vegetables, whole grains and legumes as well as a variety of protein-rich foods, like fish, poultry, legumes and eggs. In addition to their other health benefits, both protein and fiber can promote satiety and help you feel full throughout the day. To help quell &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, we followed the principles of the ant-inflammatory diet. Similar to the Mediterranean diet, the anti-inflammatory diet emphasizes a wide intake of plants, an array of protein sources and plenty of healthy fats, like avocado, fatty fish and olive oil, while limiting refined grains, added sugar and processed meats.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Unchecked chronic inflammation can increase the risk of many health conditions, including type 2 diabetes and heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To make this plan work for many people, we include three different calorie levels to choose from and meal-prep tips at the beginning of each week.

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can mix and match meals if there is one you don’t like, or browse some of our other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/anti-inflammatory-diet-recipes-8660050" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory recipes&lt;/a&gt; for additional inspiration. When creating this plan, we aimed for 1,800 calories per day with at least 80 grams of protein and 30 grams of fiber and capped sodium at 2,300 milligrams per day, as recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you’re making a swap, you may want to choose a meal with a similar nutrition profile, especially as it pertains to protein and fiber, or plan to adjust a snack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can eat the same breakfast or lunch every day if you prefer. The breakfasts range from 358 to 534 calories, while the lunches span 384 to 540 calories. If you’re closely monitoring calories or other nutrients and making a change, you may want to adjust snacks or other meals to meet your goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foods that may lower inflammation include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, unsaturated fats and fish.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These foods contain nutrients that can help reduce inflammation, such as fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, magnesium and vitamins A and C.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_689-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-Fiber&lt;/strong&gt;: Each day provides at least 30 grams of fiber, though most days come in higher than that. Fiber is a type of indigestible carbohydrate found in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and legumes. A high-fiber diet can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, improve heart health, promote gut health and even reduce inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research has found that both high total fiber intake and a high intake of cereal fibers are linked to reduced inflammation and a lower risk of developing heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Cereal fiber sources include whole grains, like bran, whole wheat and oats.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-Protein&lt;/strong&gt;: Each day provides at least 80 grams of protein from a variety of sources, like legumes, nuts, seeds, dairy, poultry, eggs and fish. Protein can help support a healthy immune system, preserve muscle mass and support bone health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While protein’s impact on inflammation is less clear, there is some research suggesting that protein intake, especially from plant-based protein sources, can help reduce inflammation in older adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follows the Anti-Inflammatory Diet&lt;/strong&gt;: This plan follows the principles of the anti-inflammatory diet by including a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, legumes and whole grains while limiting red meat, processed meat, refined grains and added sugar. Research links the anti-inflammatory diet to a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease, healthier body weight, improved cognitive function and better gut health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technique sounds so outlandish that it won an IgNobel prize in 2024. But the science behind rescuing people with blocked airways and clogged lungs by rectally delivering oxygen to the body is no joke.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                        
                                          
                                         
										

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In fact, positive results are &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/med/fulltext/S2666-6340(25)00314-9" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Med&lt;/i&gt; regarding the first human clinical trial to evaluate the potential benefits of "enteral ventilation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the first human data, and the results are limited solely to demonstrating the safety of the procedure and not its effectiveness. But now that we have established tolerance, the next step will be to evaluate how effective the process is for delivering oxygen to the bloodstream," says Takanori Takebe, MD, Ph.D., a leading expert in organoid medicine with dual appointments at Cincinnati Children's and the University of Osaka in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is enteral ventilation?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept envisions an enema-like process that uses a super-oxygenated liquid to deliver life-supporting oxygen to the bloodstream by absorbing it through the colon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key paper &lt;a href="https://phys.org/news/2021-05-mammals-anus-emergencies.html" target="_blank"&gt;detailing initial findings&lt;/a&gt; on a porcine model was featured on the cover of &lt;i&gt;Med&lt;/i&gt; in 2021 and later in the popular Canada-based science television show, "The Nature of Things." That early work led to Takebe and colleagues receiving an IgNobel Prize in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If successful in ongoing human trials, the relatively low-tech process may allow hospitals to rescue people when airways are blocked by injury or inflammation, or when lung function is severely limited by infections and other complications.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;A new idea with decades-old roots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inspiration for the procedure comes in part from observing the abilities of the loach, a bottom-feeding fish that can swallow air from the surface and absorb the oxygen through its gut, thus supplementing its gills to survive in low-oxygen conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also builds upon the work of former Cincinnati Children's researcher Leland Clark, Ph.D., (b. 1918, d. 2005) who years ago invented a perfluorocarbon liquid, now called Oxycyte. Although the product did not move forward as a potential form of artificial blood, the 1989 movie "The Abyss" included a famous scene in which a rat was shown "breathing" the special liquid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Findings and next steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study recaps findings from 27 healthy men in Japan who were asked to hold varying amounts of the perfluorocarbon liquid (without the liquid being oxygenated) for 60 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty held the liquid for the entire 60 minutes, including amounts up to 1,500 ml. At the largest volumes, participants reported abdominal bloating and discomfort, but no serious adverse events were reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key next step will be to repeat the evaluation using the oxygenated liquid to measure how much of the liquid is needed, and for how long, to improve blood &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/oxygen/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;oxygen&lt;/a&gt; levels. Eventually, Takebe and colleagues hope to expand the technology for use in newborn care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takebe—who has launched a company called EVA Therapeutics to pursue this project—says the timing of a future clinical trial will depend on the pace of fundraising.&lt;/p&gt;

The photoreceptor cells in the macula are responsible for producing sharp, detailed and colored vision. When the disease has progressed to the geographic atrophy stage, these cells deteriorate and die, and people lose their central vision — meaning that an object straight ahead may appear blurry or covered up with a dark blotch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-52e65a" class="body-graf"&gt;Roughly 22 million people in the U.S. have AMD, and about 1 million have geographic atrophy, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.macular.org/about-macular-degeneration/geographic-atrophy" target="_blank"&gt;American Macular Degeneration Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-90387c" class="body-graf"&gt;In the study, the participants, who had an average age of 79,  were fitted with the “PRIMA device,” a system meant to replicate vision. Patients wear augmented reality glasses embedded with a camera that captures their visual field. What the camera “sees” is transmitted to the chip &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/eye-implant-pig-protein-restored-sight-blind-people-rcna42681" target="_blank"&gt;implanted in their eye&lt;/a&gt; in the form of infrared light. The chip converts the light into an electrical current, which stimulates the remaining healthy cells in the macula in a realistic way, enabling signals these cells send to be interpreted by the brain as vision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-162846" class="body-graf"&gt;An image processor, which the user must carry, lets patients zoom in and magnify the images they see, which appear in black and white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-e0020b"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1125" data-original-width="2000"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251029-tiny-eye-implant-inline-lr-1b498c.png 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251029-tiny-eye-implant-inline-lr-1b498c.png 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251029-tiny-eye-implant-inline-lr-1b498c.png 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251029-tiny-eye-implant-inline-lr-1b498c.png 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251029-tiny-eye-implant-inline-lr-1b498c.png" alt="The image on the right shows what the camera sends to the user's implanted microchip."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;The image on the right shows what the camera sends to the user's implanted microchip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Science Corporation &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-405dba" class="body-graf"&gt;With the help of the PRIMA device, 80% of the 32 patients who returned for a reassessment one year after the chip implantation had achieved clinically meaningful visual improvements. Patients did experience side effects, predominantly related to the surgical procedure: The study reported that 26 serious adverse events occurred in 19 of the patients, ranging from elevated blood pressure in the eye to an accumulation of blood around the retina. The majority of the adverse events resolved within two months of the implantation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-de077d" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s the first ever therapeutic approach that has led to an improvement in visual function in this group of patients,” said Dr. Frank Holz, the trial’s lead investigator and chair of the department of ophthalmology at the University Hospital of Bonn in Germany. “Late-stage age-related macular degeneration is a dismal disease. Patients are no longer capable of reading, driving a car, watching TV or even recognizing faces. So [these results] are a game-changer in my mind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b59ed3" class="body-graf"&gt;One patient, Sheila Irvine, 70, who was fitted with the PRIMA device at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, said in a statement provided by the hospital that her life before receiving the implant was akin to “having two black discs in my eyes, with the outside distorted.” A self-described “avid bookworm” before losing her vision, Irvine said she was now able to do crosswords and read prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fc6cb2" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Sunir Garg, professor of ophthalmology at the retina service of Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia, who was not involved in the study, said the results represent a breakthrough for patients with geographic atrophy. All doctors have been able to offer, he said, are visual aids, like magnifiers, and emotional support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7b95a0" class="body-graf"&gt;“Even with new medical therapies, the best that we can do is slow it down,” said Garg, who works with several drugmakers involved in treatments for AMD, including Apellis Pharmaceuticals, the maker of pegcetacoplan.

He also said that it wasn’t clear whether the enhancements in visual ability had significantly improved the patients’ quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0e3c14" class="body-graf"&gt;But at the same time, Vavvas was also optimistic about its future potential, describing the current iteration of PRIMA as a key stepping stone in the field of vision restoration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-71b486" class="body-graf"&gt;“Think of this device as the pre-release iPhone,” he said. “The limitations are clear. We shouldn’t oversell that the quality of life really improved. But there were certain [visual] tasks at which the patients were clearly better. So it shows to us that there is potential in this approach. It is still in some ways, a prototype. They’re working on iterations of this device that will be better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5962f8" class="body-graf"&gt;New upgrades to the PRIMA device could be coming in the next couple of years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-da6dfb" class="body-graf"&gt;The PRIMA system was invented by Stanford University ophthalmology professor Daniel Palanker and is being developed by the California-based neural engineering company Science Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d03186" class="body-graf"&gt;Palanker said technical improvements are being made to increase the number of pixels in the chip from 400 to 10,000. The new chips have already been tested in rats, and the upgraded chips are being manufactured for future human trials. With the aid of the camera’s zoom function, Palanker said that this could theoretically enable patients to achieve 20/20 visual resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-04d93b"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1333" data-original-width="2000"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251019-prima-eye-implant-vl-441p-954dea.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251019-prima-eye-implant-vl-441p-954dea.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251019-prima-eye-implant-vl-441p-954dea.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251019-prima-eye-implant-vl-441p-954dea.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251019-prima-eye-implant-vl-441p-954dea.jpg" alt="A penny is next to an implant chip that is about 1/50th of it's size, laid on a surface"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;The microchip shown next to a penny.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Science Corporation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2d28f1" class="body-graf"&gt;“We are also working on next generation software that will allow patients to perceive not just black-and-white text, but also grey-scale natural images, such as faces,” Palanker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7d0485" class="body-graf"&gt;Palanker suggested that the technology could be trialed in other retinal diseases that cause blindness, such as Stargardt disease, which has similar symptoms to age-related macular degeneration but is genetic and usually affects younger people.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-469478" class="body-graf"&gt;Garg and Vavvas are eager to see larger trials that provide more details about how the device improves patients’ ability to function on a day-to-day basis.

    &lt;p&gt;About 9 in 10 adults in the United States have not heard of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome despite nearly 90% of adults being at risk for the condition, according to &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/about-9-in-10-havent-heard-of-condition-that-affects-nearly-90-of-u-s-adults" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;a recent survey&lt;/a&gt; from the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome, or CKM syndrome, is a disorder caused by the connections between &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/heart-disease/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, kidney disease, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-recommendations-measure-obesity-bmi/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The syndrome, which was &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/heart-disease-risk-prevention-and-management-redefined" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;defined by the AHA&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in October 2023, reflects how these conditions can influence or worsen each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The health conditions were previously considered separate problems and are often managed separately. With this new designation, the AHA wants people to understand that the conditions are closely connected," &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/articles/what-is-ckm-syndrome" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Mass General Brigham explains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To diagnose CKM syndrome, providers will test different risk factors, to determine your stage from 0 to 4, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic-syndrome" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Stage 0 means no risk factors; Stage 1 means you have excess body fat; Stage 2 means you have a condition such as Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure or kidney disease; Stage 3 means you have heart disease without symptoms or a high risk of it; and Stage 4 means you have heart disease with symptoms, extra body fat and risk factors for diabetes or other metabolic conditions. Stage 4 could also include kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2818457" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; published in JAMA last year, nearly 90% of U.S. adults have at least one risk factor for CKM syndrome, which include the following: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Abnormal cholesterol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High blood sugar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excess weight&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduced kidney function&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The interplay of these risk factors increases the risk for heart attack, stroke and heart failure more than any one of them alone," the AHA said in a news release about its survey.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes to eating habits and physical activity can help prevent CKM syndrome, AHA and other experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2023 interview with &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/on-call-with-dr-kumar-cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic-syndrome-or-ckm-explained/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;CBS New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, cardiologist Dr. Nidhi Kumar said 33% of Americans have three or more risk factors that contribute to this syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we think of danger in medicine, sometimes people think of the words 'cancer' or 'COVID,' but chronic diseases, like those that make up CKM, are the leading cause of death and disability in the United States," Kumar said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eduardo Sanchez, the American Heart Association's chief medical officer for prevention, said in a statement that it's important for people to know it's common to have heart, kidney and metabolic risk factors at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is reassuring that once the CKM connection was defined nearly three-quarters of those responding understood that it was important and wanted to learn more," Sanchez said about the AHA survey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cleveland Clinic adds, "researchers are hoping for a future where everyone gets holistic treatment for CKM syndrome instead of treatment for one body system at a time." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Harris Poll conducted the survey, which included about 4,000 U.S. adults, in August 2025 on behalf of the association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vitamin K, an essential nutrient that prevents blood cots and aids in bone health could also be an effective long-term treatment for neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Japanese study team took the molecule, created a novel, altered form and used it to improve the transcriptions of cells into neurons at a rate 300% higher than controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If replicated in humans, such an effect would slow or even reverse the progress of diseases like Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, and Parkinson’s, and would be one of the first to be demonstrated to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though possessing of this neuroprotective effect, naturally-forming vitamin K compounds like menaquinone-4 are likely not substantial enough to prevent the onset and progression of these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a groundbreaking study &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acschemneuro.5c00111" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in ACS Chemical Neuroscience, researchers from the Department of Bioscience and Engineering at Shibaura Institute of Technology in Japan synthesized 12 different vitamin K analogues that included a metabolite of vitamin A called retinoic acid, and a methyl ester side chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This analogue exhibited “a three-fold higher neuronal differentiation activity,” meaning it stimulated neuronal progenitor cells in mice to form new neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This novel form of vitamin K interacted heavily with the cellular receptor for metabotropic glutamate (mGluRs) which is known to be very involved with neuron intercommunication, and which if inhabited in mice, creates behavior alternations similar to those seen in dementia patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEMENTIA DRUG RESEARCH: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our research offers a potentially groundbreaking approach to treating neurodegenerative diseases. A vitamin K-derived drug that slows the progression of Alzheimer’s disease or improves its symptoms could not only improve the quality of life for patients and their families but also significantly reduce the growing societal burden of healthcare expenditures and long-term caregiving,” the authors &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/breakthrough-vitamin-k-compounds-may-reverse-alzheimers-damage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; their study by writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin K, being a safe and tolerable naturally-occurring essential nutrient, would have enormous advantages for drug manufacturers looking to capitalize on this research for a dementia treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While any form of the molecule would have to be proven efficacious as a treatment, safety trials would be very straightforward as the compound already has established safety and supplemental doses.&lt;/p&gt;

By analyzing over 5,000 blood proteins, they identified molecular signs of damage to myelin—the protective sheath around nerve fibers—long before symptoms emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key biomarkers such as IL-3 and MOG reveal a two-stage attack, first targeting myelin and later damaging the nerve fibers themselves. This discovery paves the way for an early diagnostic blood test and, potentially, preventive MS treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Detection:&lt;/strong&gt; Damage to myelin appears up to seven years before MS diagnosis, revealed by a spike in the MOG protein.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune Activation Marker:&lt;/strong&gt; IL-3 plays a central role in recruiting immune cells that trigger early brain inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Diagnostic Tool:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers identified 21 proteins that could form the basis for a predictive blood test for MS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By the time patients start seeking care for multiple sclerosis (MS), the disease has already been damaging their brains for years. But until recently, scientists didn’t understand which brain cells were being targeted or when the injury began.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, by analyzing thousands of proteins found in the blood, scientists at UC San Francisco have created the clearest picture yet of when the disease attacks the myelin sheath that covers the nerve fibers. It shows that the immune system begins attacking the brain even earlier than previously had been thought. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113463"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;During this time, IL-3 and some related proteins that orchestrate an immune reaction appeared in the blood. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study measured debris from these attacks in a person’s blood, along with the signals that coordinate the immune system to go on the attack. It lays out, for the first time, the sequence of events that eventually lead to the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery could lead to new ways to diagnose multiple sclerosis — and possibly one day prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MS first attacks the fatty myelin sheath, and a year later, it’s possible to see the breakdown of nerve fibers themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the many immune signaling proteins that were elevated in the early stage of the disease, one protein stood out: IL-3. It plays an important role in this early phase when the central nervous system is suffering significant damage, but the patient doesn’t yet feel it. IL-3 is known for recruiting immune cells to the brain and spinal cord, where they attack nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think our work opens numerous opportunities for diagnosing, monitoring, and possibility treating MS,” said Ahmed Abdelhak, MD, assistant professor of Neurology at UCSF, and the first and co-lead author of the paper, which appears in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt; on Oct. 20. “It could be a gamechanger for how we understand and manage this disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed more than 5,000 proteins in blood samples from 134 people with MS, both before and after their diagnosis. These samples were provided by the U.S. Department of Defense Serum Repository, which stores samples from armed service members when they apply to join the military. The samples are then available for study decades afterwards, by which time some of the people may have gone on to develop MS.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven years before a person’s diagnosis, they saw a spike in a protein called MOG, which stands for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein and indicates damage to the insulation around the wires of the nervous system. A year after the MOG spike appeared, they saw a spike in another protein called neurofilament light chain, which indicates damage to the wires themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this time, IL-3 and some related proteins that orchestrate an immune reaction appeared in the blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team identified about 50 proteins that herald future disease, and they have submitted a patent application for a diagnostic blood test using the top 21 of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ari Green, MD, chief of the Division of Neuroimmunology and Glial Biology in the UCSF Department of Neurology and senior author of the paper, said the study offers the hope of prevention and it gives a deeper understanding of what leads to the development of symptoms in MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We now know that MS starts way earlier than the clinical onset, creating the real possibility that we could someday prevent MS — or at least use our understanding to protect people from further injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors:&lt;/strong&gt; Other UCSF authors are Gabriel Cerono, MD, Kiarra Ning, John Boscardin, PhD, The UCSF ORIGINS Study, Christian Cordano, MD, PhD, Asritha Tubati, Camille Fouassier, Eric D.

We used high-throughput discovery proteomics and samples from presymptomatic patients with MS and matched healthy controls to define the biological neurological onset and characterize the mechanisms involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, evidence of myelin injury was seen ~7 years before the symptomatic onset and preceded evidence of axonal injury by ~1 year. By contrast, astrocyte involvement became evident only at clinical onset. Numerous changes in the serum proteome indicate the involvement of interleukin 3 and nuclear factor kappa B pathways during the presymptomatic stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, people with MS with a previously reported distinct autoantibody signature showed increased immune cell activity compared to those without. We propose a protein biomarker panel that may help distinguish presymptomatic patients with MS from healthy controls, pending validation in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings can help understand the pathophysiology of MS as well as the cascade of central nervous system injury and might facilitate early detection of MS in high-risk people.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 16:17:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTFBWaUwxUWhzYTVEcVhtemdEZ1ZzcGl2aDF5YjdZbzM1VUhSVHB5eTRSWWFCWElCbUg2SmRUNjdwLTJSVmZGdEdhS1FRdnhSaFp6cDhFYXk3TUU5SWMtZTJBOWZtZXBaTGc</guid></item><item><title>美国国家医学科学院选出100名新成员-美国国家医学科学院</title><link>https://nam.edu/news-and-insights/100-new-members-elected-2025/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="elementor-element elementor-element-63cdbef1 big-para elementor-widget elementor-widget-theme-post-content" data-id="63cdbef1" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON — The National Academy of Medicine (NAM) today announced the election of 90 regular members and 10 international members during its &lt;a href="https://nam.edu/events/annual-meeting/"&gt;annual meeting&lt;/a&gt;. Election to the Academy is considered one of the highest honors in the fields of health and medicine and recognizes individuals who have demonstrated outstanding professional achievement and commitment to service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am deeply honored to welcome these extraordinary health and medicine leaders and researchers into the National Academy of Medicine,” said NAM President Victor J. Dzau. “Their demonstrated excellence in tackling public health challenges, leading major discoveries, improving health care, advancing health policy, and addressing health equity will critically strengthen our collective ability to tackle the most pressing health challenges of our time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New members are elected by current members through a process that recognizes individuals who have made major contributions to the advancement of the medical sciences, health care, and public health. A diversity of talent among NAM’s membership is assured by its Articles of Organization, which stipulate that at least one-quarter of the membership is selected from fields outside the health professions — for example, from such fields as law, engineering, social sciences, and the humanities. The newly elected members bring NAM’s total membership to more than 2,500, which includes more than 200 international members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Established originally as the Institute of Medicine in 1970 by the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine addresses critical issues in health, science, medicine, and related policy and inspires positive actions across sectors. NAM works alongside the National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Engineering to provide independent, objective analysis and advice to the nation and conduct other activities to solve complex problems and inform public policy decisions. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine also encourage education and research, recognize outstanding contributions to knowledge, and increase public understanding of STEMM. With their election, NAM members make a commitment to volunteer their service in National Academies activities.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever taken an edible to more easily drift off to bed, you’re not the only one. New research shows that a substantial portion of young American adults have used cannabis and/or alcohol as a sleep aid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of Michigan conducted the study, which examined nationally representative survey data. They found that roughly one in five young adults have relied on these two drugs to help them sleep at times, particularly cannabis. Though effective, people’s overreliance on these drugs could eventually become a double-edged sword, the researchers caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Cannabis and alcohol can help initiate sleep, but regular use may be problematic,” they wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2840034"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this month in JAMA Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A common sleep aid&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers examined data from the Monitoring the Future (MTF) Panel Study, a long-running project measuring drug use among teens and young adults. The project, run by the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research, routinely surveys high schoolers about their use of drugs and overall health, then continues to follow a subset of students into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The current study involved nearly 1,500 people between the ages of 19 and 30. Approximately 22% had reported using either cannabis and/or alcohol in the past year to help them sleep, the researchers found. Around 18% reported using cannabis specifically, while about 7% used alcohol. Of those who reported using cannabis in general, roughly 41% had used it at times for sleep, compared to nearly 9% of regular alcohol users. People who used these drugs daily or near-daily were also more likely to report using them as sleep aids.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Potential issues&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many of us struggle with sleep from time to time. A 2022 study &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2798209"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that roughly 30% of U.S. adults have had trouble sleeping, including 23% of U.S. adults between the ages of 20 and 39. So it’s certainly understandable why many young people turn to these drugs to help them doze off. But the researchers note that there are real tradeoffs to using cannabis and alcohol for sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The most notable drawback is that our body gradually gets habituated to these drugs, meaning it takes increasing amounts to feel the same effects. In other words, over time, a person might need more cannabis or alcohol to help them sleep. These larger doses can then raise the risk of someone developing an unhealthy dependency on these drugs, also known as a substance use disorder. Trying to wean off these drugs can also be tricky, since both &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/marijuana-weed-withdrawal"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/alcohol-withdrawal"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; withdrawal can cause insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers say that doctors should be more aware about the common use of cannabis and alcohol for sleep, which may help them step in before either a person’s sleeping or drug habits can become a bigger issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Raising clinicians’ awareness about the common intersection of substance use and sleep problems among young adults is important for screening and developing and offering clinical interventions for these critical health risk behaviors,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Why It’s a Concern: &lt;/strong&gt;Some blood pressure medications can increase potassium levels in your blood, so it's not recommended for people with chronic kidney disease, or taking certain medications like spironolactone, who have had issues with high potassium foods.

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Block drug absorption: &lt;/strong&gt;Food can lower drug absorption, making the medication less effective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce drug breakdown: &lt;/strong&gt;Food can block drug breakdown, so the medicine stays in your blood longer. This can cause more side effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase drug absorption:&lt;/strong&gt; Food can increase drug absorption. Too much medicine in the body can cause side effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase blood pressure, which can counteract drug effects: &lt;/strong&gt;Some foods, like those high in sodium, can increase blood pressure. This can work against the effects of medicines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cause mineral imbalances:&lt;/strong&gt; Potassium and sodium balance is important for controlling blood pressure. Some medicines change how your body keeps or gets rid of these minerals.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, if your medicine keeps more potassium in your blood and you also eat a lot of potassium, it can cause hyperkalemia. This means too much potassium in your blood, which can be dangerous if not treated.

The exposure has been tied to a young child who was not vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said the child passed through the main hospital lobby and by Suite 1010 (Surgical and Procedural Services) on their way to outpatient testing at &lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/locations/palos-hospital" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Northwestern Medicine Palos Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, 12251 S. 80th Ave., Palos Heights. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The virus can linger in an area for up to two hours and can be especially dangerous for babies and young children, pregnant women, and people with compromised immune systems. Cook County health officials are working to identify and notify people who may have visited the lobby, Suite 1010 and outpatient testing area, between the hours of 4:30 to 7:15 p.m. Monday, Oct. 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease that spreads easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. Measles is so contagious that if one person has it, 90 percent of the people close to that person who are not immune or are unvaccinated will also become infected with the measles virus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;For People Who May Have Been Exposed:&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who may have been exposed should check with their health care provider if they are unsure about prior vaccination. The health care provider will determine the need for testing if symptoms develop. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If an exposed person develops symptoms, they should call a healthcare provider before going to a medical office or emergency department for evaluation to ensure that special arrangement can be made to prevent patients and medical staff from possible exposure. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People that are unvaccinated against measles, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;mumps and rubella (MMR)&lt;/a&gt; and are exposed should talk with their doctor about getting MMR vaccine. It is not harmful to get MMR vaccine after being exposed to measles, mumps or rubella and doing so may prevent measles. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most people are vaccinated against measles routinely in childhood and are not at high risk. The best defense against measles is vaccination. Two doses of MMR vaccine are 97 percent effective against measles and generally provide lifelong immunity. The first dose should be given between 12-15 months of age; the second between the ages of 4-6 years old. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect Yourself from Misinformation- Vitamin A is not a substitute for vaccination. Vitamin A supplementation does not prevent measles infection. It can help reduce the severity of measles symptoms — particularly in malnourished children or those with vitamin A deficiency—but only after infection has occurred. Relying on vitamin A instead of vaccination puts individuals and communities at risk of infection, complications, and disease spread. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unvaccinated individuals who do not have a healthcare provider are encouraged to contact &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/links-1.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:*2F*2Fcookcountyhealth.org*2F/1/010001999c32ba5d-498faff7-e197-4bb6-867c-f49487e76240-000000/WzxWWf7mEsu7NSBnpW87wIiX2gIF5Wi5lUWuCZZ037g=425__;JSUl!!MLa4LY8OsLnxtQ!zKe3WUNjv_FLSWsoHfDHWc-GD9r9Xuzm5j9Ae1gE_gFHc8wstxH7DJUx4vxw9JWwgJxsisee1TocnnypkNGFXXvjoHamzVYx%24" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Cook County Health&lt;/a&gt; at 312-864-1111 to schedule a vaccination appointment or reach out to a &lt;a href="https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;federally-qualified health center. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/publichealth" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Chicago Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt; offers free MMR vaccinations for anyone who needs them, regardless of insurance status, at CDPH immunization clinics throughout the city.

The implant, which measures 2 millimetres by 2 millimetres, and is just 30 micrometres thick, is surgically inserted beneath the retina to replace the light-sensitive cells that have been lost to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinical trial, which is described today in &lt;i&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, involved 38 people with advanced AMD whose retinas had degenerated severely. One year after device implantation, 80% of participants had gained a clinically meaningful improvement in their vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Where this dead retina was a complete blind spot, vision was restored,” says trial leader Frank Holz, an ophthalmologist at the University of Bonn in Germany. “Patients could read letters, they could read words, and they could function in their daily life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02629-w" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03420-x/d41586-025-03420-x_19705470.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Reversing blindness with stem cells&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite some minor events related to implantation surgery, the trial’s safety-monitoring board viewed the device’s benefits as outweighing its risks. In June, the device’s owners — the San Francisco-based neurotechnology company Science Corporation — applied for certification that would allow the device to be sold on the European market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think this is an exciting and significant study, which has been well-designed and analysed. It gives hope for providing vision in patients for whom this was more ‘science-fiction’ than reality,” says Francesca Cordeiro, an ophthalmologist at Imperial College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Restored vision&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMD is the commonest form of incurable blindness in older people. There are two main types, wet and dry AMD. The current work studied people with dry AMD, the advanced form of which affects around 5 million people globally. In dry AMD, the central retina’s light-sensitive cells die over a period of years, leaving affected individuals with intact peripheral vision but without their high-acuity central vision. “They can’t recognize faces, they can’t read, they can’t drive a car, they can’t watch television,” says Holz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The light-sensitive cells that die (rods and cones) convert light into electrochemical signals that are conveyed to other types of retinal neurons, which then send messages to the brain’s visual-processing regions. Because retinal neurons survive AMD, scientists reasoned that a light-sensitive implant that electrically stimulates the retina according to the pattern of photons striking it could reinstate a sense of vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03575-3" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03420-x/d41586-025-03420-x_19914304.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;A visual guide to repairing the retina&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implant, termed PRIMA — for photovoltaic retina implant microarray — was originally developed by the Paris-based company Pixium Vision, and was acquired by Science Corporation last year. It is wireless, unlike previous retinal devices. And, being photovoltaic, the photons that activate it also provide the energy source for generating its electrical output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is used in combination with glasses that contain a camera that captures images and converts them into patterns of infrared light that they transmit to the retinal implant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system, which allows users to zoom in and out on target objects, and adjust contrast and brightness, does, Holz says, take months of intensive training to use optimally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current study, 38 individuals were treated at 17 clinical sites across 5 European countries, and 32 of the participants were tested a year after implantation. Twenty-six of them had a clinically meaningful improvement in their vision — which, on average, amounted to being able to see two lines further down a standard eye test chart of letters. Overall, most participants’ vision came close to the resolution achievable with PRIMA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the study’s end, most recipients were using PRIMA at home to read letters, words and numbers. Of the 32, 22 said that their user satisfaction was medium to high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

PBS</title><link>https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/advice-to-feed-babies-peanuts-early-and-often-helped-thousands-of-kids-avoid-allergies</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-text"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;A decade after a landmark study proved that feeding peanut products to young babies could prevent development of life-threatening allergies, new research finds the change has made a big difference in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peanut allergies began to decline in the U.S. after guidance first issued in 2015 upended medical practice by recommending introducing the allergen to infants starting as early as 4 months. The rate of peanut allergies in children ages 0 to 3 fell by more than 27% after guidance for high-risk kids was first issued in 2015, and by more than 40% after the recommendations were expanded in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s a remarkable thing, right?” said Dr. David Hill, an allergist and researcher at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and author of a study published Monday in the medical journal Pediatrics. Hill and colleagues analyzed electronic health records from dozens of pediatric practices to track diagnoses of food allergies in young children before, during and after the guidelines were issued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/giving-babies-peanut-based-foods-early-prevents-allergies"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Give peanuts to infants to prevent allergies, new guidelines say&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can actually come to you today and say there are less kids with food allergy today than there would have been if we hadn’t implemented this public health effort,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 60,000 children have avoided food allergies since 2015, including 40,000 children who otherwise would have developed peanut allergies. Still, about 8% of children are affected by food allergies, including more than 2% with a peanut allergy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peanut allergy is caused when the body’s immune system mistakenly identifies proteins in peanuts as harmful and releases chemicals that trigger allergic symptoms, including hives, respiratory symptoms and, sometimes, life-threatening anaphylaxis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, doctors had recommended delaying feeding children peanuts and other foods likely to trigger allergies until age 3. But in 2015, Gideon Lack at King’s College London, published the groundbreaking Learning Early About Peanut Allergy, or LEAP, trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lack and colleagues showed that introducing peanut products in infancy reduced the future risk of developing food allergies by more than 80%. Later analysis showed that the protection persisted in about 70% of kids into adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study immediately sparked new guidelines urging early introduction of peanuts — but putting them into practice has been slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only about 29% of pediatricians and 65% of allergists reported following the expanded guidance issued in 2017, surveys found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confusion and uncertainty about the best way to introduce peanuts early in life led to the lag, according to a commentary that accompanied the study. Early on, medical experts and parents alike questioned whether the practice could be adopted outside of tightly controlled clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data for the analysis came from a subset of participating practice sites and may not represent the entire U.S. pediatric population, noted the commentary, led by Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a child allergy expert at Northwestern University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the new research offers “promising evidence that early allergen introduction is not only being adopted but may be making a measurable impact,” the authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocates for the 33 million people in the U.S. with food allergies welcomed signs that early introduction of peanut products is catching on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This research reinforces what we already know and underscores a meaningful opportunity to reduce the incidence and prevalence of peanut allergy nationwide,” said Sung Poblete, chief executive of the nonprofit group Food Allergy Research &amp;amp; Education, or FARE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study emphasizes the current guidance, updated in 2021, which calls for introducing peanuts and other major food allergens between four and six months, without prior screening or testing, Hill said. Parents should consult their pediatricians about any questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t have to be a lot of the food, but little tastes of peanut butter, milk-based yogurt, soy-based yogurts and tree butters,” he said. “These are really good ways to allow the immune system exposure to these allergenic foods in a safe way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiffany Leon, 36, a Maryland registered dietician and director at FARE, introduced peanuts and other allergens early to her own sons, James, 4, and Cameron, 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, Leon’s own mother was shocked at the advice to feed babies such foods before the age of 3, she said. But Leon explained how the science had changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a dietician, I practice evidence-based recommendations,” she said. “So when someone told me, ‘This is how it’s done now, these are the new guidelines,’ I just though, OK, well, this is what we’re going to do.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The genes we inherit may have a subtle influence over whether we experiment with and make a habit of using cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team led by researchers from Western University in Canada, the University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego), and personal genomics and biotechnology company 23andMe compared the full genomes of 131,895 individuals with self-reported frequency of cannabis use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to identifying variations in two key genetic sequences associated with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cannabis-really-has-changed-significantly-since-todays-parents-were-teens"&gt;cannabis use&lt;/a&gt;, the study linked the same genetic patterns to more than a hundred other physical and mental health traits, providing clues on how drug use relates to our wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/air-pollution-strongly-associated-with-dna-mutations-tied-to-lung-cancer"&gt;Air Pollution 'Strongly Associated' With DNA Mutations Tied to Lung Cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous factors can affect whether an individual uses drugs for self-medication or recreational purposes, from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.36571"&gt;where they live&lt;/a&gt; to how much &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/large-genetic-study-links-cannabis-use-to-psychiatric-cognitive-and-physical-health"&gt;money they have&lt;/a&gt;. Genetics often has a more indirect impact on our habits, making some prone to experimental or frequent use despite risks of ongoing harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While most people who try cannabis do not go on to develop cannabis use disorder, some studies estimate that nearly 30 percent will," &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/large-genetic-study-links-cannabis-use-to-psychiatric-cognitive-and-physical-health"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sandra Sanchez-Roige, a professor of psychiatry at UC San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Understanding the genetics of early-stage behaviors may help clarify who is at greater risk, opening the door to prevention and intervention strategies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first of the genes highlighted by the researchers is Cell Adhesion Molecule 2 (&lt;em&gt;CADM2&lt;/em&gt;), which helps handle cell assembly and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-first-of-its-kind-signal-has-been-detected-in-human-brains"&gt;nerve cell communication&lt;/a&gt;. It appears connected to measures of lifetime use of cannabis and frequency, based on these new findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, the gene Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 3 (&lt;em&gt;GRM3&lt;/em&gt;) also seems involved. It contributes to neuron signaling and long-term &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brains-memory-center-never-stops-making-neurons-study-confirms"&gt;brain plasticity&lt;/a&gt; and has been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1503/jpn.130242"&gt;linked with psychiatric disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CADM2&lt;/em&gt; has previously &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-023-02453-y"&gt;been linked&lt;/a&gt; to cannabis use, but not frequency, while &lt;em&gt;GRM3&lt;/em&gt; hasn't been connected to cannabis in prior studies. Researchers could potentially investigate how the newfound DNA variations may affect the expression/function of these genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also compared their findings to other DNA variations and gene maps, spotting overlaps with conditions including anxiety,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="177742" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-the-surprising-age-at-which-your-brain-reaches-its-peak"&gt;executive cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;, and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="177742" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_177745" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177745" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/GeneGraph.jpg" alt="DNA chart" class="wp-image-177745 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/GeneGraph.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/GeneGraph-600x280.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-177745" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;DNA variations near two genes in particular were highlighted.

The agency scaled back &lt;a href="/news/2025/9/19/us-vaccine-advisory-panel-does-not-recommend-covid-jabs-for-all"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; vaccine recommendations, approved COVID-19 vaccines for fewer people and aimed to remove the preservative &lt;a href="/news/2025/6/28/what-is-thimerosal-vaccine-preservative-called-toxic-by-us-health-chief"&gt;thimerosal&lt;/a&gt; from US vaccines. Experts told PolitiFact scientific research did not support its removal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section class="more-on"&gt;&lt;h2 class="more-on__heading"&gt;Recommended Stories &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list of 3 items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;end of list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a September 22 news conference, in which US President Donald Trump told people not to take Tylenol during pregnancy, he also mentioned another objective. “We want no aluminium in the vaccine,” he said. The administration was already in the process of removing aluminium from vaccines, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About two weeks later, on October 8, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, announced a new working group focused on the childhood vaccine schedule. Its discussion topics include vaccine ingredient safety and aluminium adjuvants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Malone, an ACIP member who has opposed COVID-19 vaccines, told Axios he expected the ACIP would determine there was “a lot of evidence” of “issues” with aluminium in vaccines. The committee would likely vote to re-categorise vaccines containing aluminium adjuvants so that people would have to discuss with their doctor before getting them, Malone told Axios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could have far-reaching ramifications. Here’s what to know about aluminium in vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: Small amounts of aluminium are sometimes included in vaccines as adjuvants, or substances that boost the body’s immune response to the vaccine to ensure protection from infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That boost means people can get fewer vaccine doses in smaller quantities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-when-used-how-much-aluminium-is-in-a-vaccine"&gt;Q: When used, how much aluminium is in a vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: Vaccines with aluminium adjuvants usually contain less than 1mg aluminium per dose, according to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is a pretty abstract number. To help make it more concrete: a milligram is one-thousandth (1/1,000th) of 1g. One gram is about the weight of a raisin or a stick of gum. Imagine cutting one of those items into 1,000 equal pieces. One of the pieces would be about 1mg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-newsletter-slot" data-testid="article-newsletter-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is another way to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People come in contact with and consume aluminium all of the time. It is one of the most abundant metal elements in the Earth’s crust, according to the US Geological Survey. It is naturally occurring in soil, air and water. Food is the main way people are exposed to aluminium. The average adult eats 7mg to 9mg of aluminium per day, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A baby in its first six months might receive a total of about 4.4mg of aluminium from recommended vaccines. In the same period of time, a breastfed infant would ingest about 7mg of aluminium from breastmilk, and a formula-fed baby would ingest about 38mg from formula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-how-long-have-vaccines-contained-aluminium"&gt;Q: How long have vaccines contained aluminium?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: Aluminium adjuvants have been used in vaccines for more than 70 years, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aluminium is one of our oldest adjuvants; it’s been used in vaccines since the 1920s,” said Dr Peter Hotez, a Baylor College of Medicine professor and codirector of Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-how-do-we-know-it-s-safe-to-include-small-amounts-of-aluminium-in-vaccines"&gt;Q: How do we know it’s safe to include small amounts of aluminium in vaccines?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: Every vaccine’s safety and efficacy are tested in animal studies and human clinical trials before the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licenses it for public use. Every vaccine containing adjuvants has been tested, and health agencies continuously monitor their safety, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over several decades of use, vaccines with aluminium adjuvants have been proven safe, the FDA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines containing aluminium have been “given to billions of people worldwide now”, said Dr Kawsar Talaat, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing body of research has also found that aluminium adjuvants do not cause aluminium toxicity or other adverse outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-do-aluminium-adjuvants-have-any-risks"&gt;Q: Do aluminium adjuvants have any risks?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: Rarely, some people have allergic reactions to aluminium in the same way they might have allergic reactions to other substances, Talaat said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, researchers published a retrospective, observational study on more than 325,000 children that found an association between vaccine-related aluminium exposure and persistent asthma. Association is not the same as causation, meaning the study did not prove a link between aluminium in vaccines and asthma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts from the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics encouraged more research on the subject because the backwards-looking observational study did not prove causation and also had limitations, including that it excluded many children who developed asthma before they turned two years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2025 study found no increased risk of asthma associated with childhood exposure to aluminium-absorbed vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-which-vaccines-contain-aluminium-adjuvants"&gt;Q: Which vaccines contain aluminium adjuvants?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: At least 25 vaccines approved for use in the US have aluminium adjuvants, the CDC says. That includes vaccines that protect against HPV, hepatitis A and B and diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (whooping cough).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-which-vaccines-do-not-contain-aluminium-adjuvants"&gt;Q: Which vaccines do not contain aluminium adjuvants?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s list of vaccines without adjuvants includes vaccines against COVID-19, Ebola, meningococcal, polio and rabies. Additionally, most seasonal flu shots and the vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella do not contain aluminium adjuvants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-can-we-remove-aluminium-from-vaccines"&gt;Q: Can we remove aluminium from vaccines?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: Not quickly. If it could be done at all, it would take years to develop, test and license new, aluminium-free vaccines. Many of the vaccines with aluminium adjuvants do not have aluminium-free formulas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A vaccine is licensed based on all of its ingredients and the exact manufacturing process,” Talaat said. “If you were to take an ingredient out of a vaccine, you would have to start all over with the clinical trials and the manufacturing, and it is highly possible that some of these vaccines wouldn’t work without the aluminium in there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although other adjuvants exist, they are newer and often more scarce than aluminium, which is abundant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An immediate ban on aluminium in vaccines would drastically reduce people’s ability to protect themselves and others against numerous diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think we’d see outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases,” Talaat said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-why-do-people-think-aluminium-in-vaccines-is-causing-autism"&gt;Q: Why do people think aluminium in vaccines is causing autism?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: A 2011 study said vaccines with aluminium adjuvants “may be a significant” contributing factor to the rising number of &lt;a href="/news/2025/9/23/trumps-tylenol-announcement-what-causes-autism-and-is-cuba-autism-free"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; diagnoses in kids, Nature reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year later, a World Health Organization vaccine safety committee called the 2011 study “seriously flawed”. The 2011 study and another by the same authors compared vaccines’ aluminium content and autism rates in several countries, the WHO group said, but that cannot be used to establish a causal relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We studied aluminium, and have no link between aluminium and autism,” Talaat said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 13:52:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQNlYtakI1d2lCT1U2UGF6SVNPcm9pWXBZYk1ZdnlFV0hXcmd2aUdlaHU0a3prUGdaRXkzYUxZQ1U2Qy1ZbjJBUWpnazctYmhEVWIwV213VmRPcW50VFJBbHNEeXhtaGZZOENVU2h1TWpvRVEzbk1zNkY0cmREaUJzX1RjZFhuWmg3MGszWmlxYy1OTlNLbWM5LWxzRk7SAaIBQVVfeXFMTzVZWV8xSEluLS1Zd2pDbjI2dTU0RlF4bUpCdXMyaGxGaXpPVUFaRGNxc254NXkxZmNyM0ZGU1BVSkVodENCRnd0cXNtV3BqaGctcS1TZFNaREg4em1ya1NXNTZUWmZBMlpuTW1nY2Z2SW51N0RXYkJFbEk3UEVYS1RXbFBrcmFIVU9NYkotV05wNE5mZk5EdGhXNWxPLXN5UUpR</guid></item><item><title>断开大脑的一部分使其进入深度睡眠-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03388-8</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03388-8/d41586-025-03388-8_51582210.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03388-8/d41586-025-03388-8_51582210.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Close up view of a young woman asleep in bed." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03388-8/d41586-025-03388-8_51582210.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Surgically severing part of the brain can send the area into a deep sleep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Peter Cade/Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slow, sleep-like brain waves persist in part of the brain that has been surgically disconnected from the rest of the organ even though the person is awake. The findings&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;PLoS Biology&lt;/i&gt;, add to researchers’ understanding of what conscious and unconscious brain states look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children with severe epilepsy who do not respond to medication can undergo a surgical procedure called a hemispherotomy. During surgery, clinicians disconnect the part of the brain in which seizures originate from the rest of the brain, stopping them from spreading. The disconnected tissue is left in the skull and has an intact blood supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team wanted to find out whether the disconnected part has some form of awareness — or was capable of exhibiting consciousness, says co-author Marcello Massimini, a neurophysiology researcher at the University of Milan in Italy. “The question arises because we have no access” to the disconnected region, he says, adding that it was unclear what happens once part of the brain is isolated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies investigating consciousness are difficult because there is no consensus on what conscious and unconscious states in the brain look like, says Ariel Zeleznikow-Johnston, a neuroscientist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. “There’s no generally accepted definitive signatures of consciousness in terms of electrical readings or brain activity,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even defining unconsciousness is challenging, because activities associated with consciousness, such as remembering dreams, can occur during states associated with unconsciousness, such as sleep or anaesthesia, Massimini says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Asleep or awake&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Italy, Australia and the United Kingdom examined electroencephalograms (EEGs) — a test that measures electrical activity in the brain — from ten awake children before they had a hemispherotomy and between six months and three years after the procedure. They compared the recordings with a database of EEGs from children with typical brains that were taken while they were awake or asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that the electrical activity slowed in the disconnected region after surgery, whereas activity in the intact brain did not change. The EEG of the intact region was also similar to EEGs from control children who were awake. After surgery, the disconnected region became dominated by slow rhythms called delta waves and was similar to EEGs taken while control children were in deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The slow pattern persists for months or years after surgery. Massimini says this finding raises questions about its function. The pattern has also been observed in injured parts of the brain among awake people who have had a stroke or traumatic brain injury. It could be protective, involved in maintaining a stable environment in the brain or helping the brain adapt to injury, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They could also lessen the need for animal testing, which is ethically problematic for many people. But framing NAMs as innovative disrupters and ‘traditional animal models’ as outdated holdovers — as many are now doing — oversimplifies a reality that is much more nuanced. Worse, it is distracting researchers from considering the scientific, ethical and translational issues related to both types of approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Complementary approaches&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a clinically trained veterinarian and biomedical scientist, I have been using mouse models to try to understand human genetic diseases for more than 20 years. The principles driving the development of NAMs are not new. For decades, researchers have been using tools, such as human induced pluripotent stem cells, to garner information relevant to humans and to lessen the need for animal testing. What’s brought all this to the fore are major technological advances in NAMs and a push by regulators and funders globally for the expanded use of these methods in research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But instead of asking whether ‘to NAM or not to NAM?’ when considering the use of anything as a research model, the question should be: ‘Does the model I am using faithfully represent the biological system I am studying?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03344-6" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03345-5/d41586-025-03345-5_51591564.png"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Alternatives to animal testing are the future — it’s time that journals, funders and scientists embrace them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAMs and animal models offer distinct, often complementary insights into the workings of complex &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; biological systems. For well-defined, narrow applications, such as in toxicology, or when researchers are wanting to assess a specific biological process or disease mechanism at the molecular, chemical, cellular or organ level, NAMs are proving highly useful. Currently, however, no NAM can model how a specific gene functions in a person, how an organ or the entire body works or how a disease progresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All models — whether they are NAMs or inbred mice — should be updated, refined or replaced as tools and data emerge that allow researchers to better match models to the human system they are trying to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experimental technologies, such as the gene-editing tool&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; CRISPR–Cas9, have made it easier for researchers to design animal models that more faithfully recapitulate human biological processes or phenomena.

For instance, the disease models could have been oversimplified, or the group sizes made too small, or the animals being tested might not have been assigned to the treatment groups in a sufficiently random manner. Many of these issues could apply equally to studies involving NAMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A problem with framing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state had just passed “the Coronavirus Stop Act” in 2023, which banned nearly all COVID-19 vaccine requirements. If lawmakers did that for COVID-19, Manookian reasoned, they could do the same for all communicable diseases and all medical decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her theory was right, ultimately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bill she penned in the summer of 2024 made it through the Republican-controlled House and Senate in early 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manookian took to social media to rally support for the legislation as it sat on the desk of Gov. Brad Little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the governor vetoed it. &lt;a href="https://gov.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/veto_s-1023aaaa_2025.pdf"&gt;In a letter&lt;/a&gt;, he explained that he saw the bill as government intrusion on “parents’ freedom to ensure their children stay healthy.” During an outbreak, he said, schools wouldn’t be able to send home students “with highly contagious conditions” like measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manookian tried again days after the veto. In the next version of the bill, protections during a disease outbreak applied only to “healthy” people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, Little signed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weeks after the signing, Manookian joined like-minded advocates on a stage in Washington, DC, for a launch event for the MAHA Institute, a group with strong ties to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (MAHA stands for Make America Healthy Again.) The new Health and Human Services secretary had denounced vaccines for years before President Donald Trump appointed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the gathering, Manookian announced her next mission: to make it “a societal norm and to codify it in law” that nobody can dictate any other person’s medical choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to roll that out to other states, and we’re going to make America free again,” Manookian &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/fONtd73sNJg?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=81"&gt;told the audience&lt;/a&gt; in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manookian’s commitment to bring along the rest of the country has continued ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her nonprofit, the Health Freedom Defense Fund, is now distributing &lt;a href="https://healthfreedomdefense.org/resources/"&gt;model legislation and a how-to guide&lt;/a&gt;, with talking points to persuade legislators. Manookian said in podcast interviews that she is working with the nonprofit &lt;a href="https://standforhealthfreedom.com/about-us/"&gt;Stand For Health Freedom&lt;/a&gt; to mobilize activists in every state.&lt;/p&gt;

Colorectal &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.aol.com/shopping/health/article/would-you-wear-a-shirt-that-says-colonoscopy-enthusiast-these-cancer-survivors-want-you-to-154214235.html" data-ylk="slk:cancer rates are on the rise;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cancer rates are on the rise&lt;/a&gt;, and inadequate fiber intake is a culprit. Americans often experience the consequences of low fiber intake, such as constipation, bloating, or discomfort. And now that fiber is on everyone’s radar, it has made its social media debut as the latest health trend: fibermaxxing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most health professionals agree that increasing fiber intake is beneficial, too much of a good thing can cause problems. Let’s dive deeper into the fibermaxxing trend, why it’s so popular on social media, and when it can be more hurtful than helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="what-is-fibermaxxing"&gt;What is fibermaxxing?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibermaxxing is just as it sounds: maximizing your daily fiber intake. The goal is to meet or exceed the recommended daily fiber intake to reap health benefits, like improved digestion and more regular bowel movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most healthy adults are advised to eat approximately 14 grams of fiber for every 1,000 calories they eat, or about 25 grams for women and 34 grams for men, according to the most recent &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/resources/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dietary guidelines;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dietary guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But most Americans eat 16 grams per day on average, which is well below the recommended amount. According to &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/candace-pumper" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Candace Pumper;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Candace Pumper&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, low fiber intake is a big problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Colorectal cancer rates have increased among people under the age of 50, and research indicates diets low in fiber are a risk factor,” she says. “Optimizing fiber intake is an important health strategy for reducing their risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-fibermaxxing"&gt;The advantages and disadvantages of fibermaxxing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since low-fiber diets are a concern, fibermaxxing can be beneficial for many Americans. But it’s easy to take a health trend too far. We asked Pumper to explain how fibermaxxing can help Americans increase their fiber intake and point out its disadvantages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="the-advantages-of-fibermaxxing"&gt;The advantages of fibermaxxing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More awareness&lt;/strong&gt;: Because of the fibermaxxing trend, more people are aware of fiber’s role in reducing the risk of certain chronic diseases. “I think more people will become more mindful of their baseline fiber intake and actively work toward improvement,” says Pumper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functional health&lt;/strong&gt;: Many of us rightfully associate fiber intake with certain functional benefits, like digestive movement and regular bathroom visits. Pumper explains that fiber adds bulk to stool, which is important for promoting regular bowel movements and preventing constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physiological health&lt;/strong&gt;: Pumper also explains that fiber promotes physiological benefits through fermentation by the gut microbiome, such as lowering cholesterol, regulating blood sugar, promoting satiety, and reducing inflammation. These benefits are associated with a decreased risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="the-disadvantages-of-fibermaxxing"&gt;The disadvantages of fibermaxxing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bloating and discomfort&lt;/strong&gt;: If you hop on this trend too quickly, Pumper warns that you might not feel as healthy as you thought you would. “Sudden increases in fiber or consuming too much fiber, whether above the recommended daily amount or all at once, may cause bloating, gas, and abdominal discomfort,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not for everyone&lt;/strong&gt;: While most Americans don’t meet fiber intake requirements, some need low-fiber diets on purpose. “Fibermaxxing is not appropriate for everyone, especially those who have been medically advised to follow a low-fiber diet as part of their care,” she says. For example, a doctor may advise a low-fiber diet before a colonoscopy or if someone has active inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could encourage disordered eating&lt;/strong&gt;: Any diet that significantly increases or decreases certain nutrients should be practiced carefully. Pumper explains that fibermaxxing has the potential to affect mental well-being, reinforcing an “all-or-nothing” mindset about eating and weight that can lead to nutritional gaps or digestive issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="how-to-eat-more-fiber-safely"&gt;How to eat more fiber safely&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to increase your fiber intake without upsetting your stomach or causing health issues, consider consulting a healthcare provider, gradually increasing your dietary fiber intake, and diversifying the types of fiber you eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consult your healthcare provider&lt;/strong&gt;: Before making drastic changes to your diet, talk to a healthcare professional about your current health status. If you have a digestive health issue or take certain medications, you may need professional guidance to monitor your nutrition. For example, Pumper advises that older adults and those taking corticosteroids (like prednisone or budesonide) check with their doctor because they may be more sensitive to major dietary changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase fiber intake slowly&lt;/strong&gt;: To avoid bloating, gas, and discomfort, increase your fiber intake by only a few grams per day. Make one or two food swaps, like exchanging crackers for celery sticks with your favorite dip. “Fiber intake should be increased slowly, especially if you are starting below the minimum recommended intake. Also, balance fiber intake with adequate hydration to prevent digestive discomfort,” said Pumper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mix up the types of fiber you eat&lt;/strong&gt;: According to Pumper, the kind of fiber you eat matters because it impacts digestion differently. Soluble fiber (found in oats, legumes, and nuts) slows the digestion process, which is known to support weight loss. Insoluble fiber (found in fruits, veggies, and brown rice) helps you pass stool more easily and regularly. Aim for the right balance of both: about 5–10 grams of soluble fiber and 15–30 grams of insoluble fiber per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="where-to-find-healthy-sources-of-fiber"&gt;Where to find healthy sources of fiber&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many &lt;a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon Canada;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=63045c63-8df1-46e8-bdd0-1716edf6ace5&amp;amp;itemId=amazon_B003CT2YQY&amp;amp;siteId=us-aol&amp;amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;amp;contentUuid=8e9558c4-6e78-46c2-b7a7-0dcb233e07cf&amp;amp;featureId=text-link&amp;amp;merchantName=Amazon+Canada&amp;amp;linkText=fiber+supplements&amp;amp;custData=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&amp;amp;signature=AQAAAc8n1EuuWqvFQ8cLjqs0Qd8opInCsH2eL-ZiRh8CWmXf&amp;amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMetamucil-Multi-Health-Psyllium-Supplement-Sugar-Free%2Fdp%2FB003CT2YQY%2F&amp;amp;spaceId=1197803369" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fiber supplements;elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon Canada;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;fiber supplements&lt;/a&gt; are sold on the market, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4415962/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; says that few offer the right formula to make a difference. The best way to increase fiber intake is through real foods, rather than relying on pills and powders (unless your healthcare provider advises otherwise).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fiber found in real food works alongside vitamins, minerals, and water to deliver benefits to your body. Isolated fiber supplements don’t have other nutrients to help support their role in digestive health, so their benefits can be limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To eat more soluble fiber, try:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oatmeal with limited added sugar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lentils, chickpeas, and beans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flax seeds and sunflower seeds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To eat more insoluble fiber, try:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular and sweet potatoes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apples, berries, and mango&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barley, brown rice, quinoa, and whole wheat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need guidance, talk to your healthcare provider, a dietician, or a nutritionist about the best ways to incorporate more fiber into your diet in a safe and healthy way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this piece — or you just wanna chat about your favorite products you think we should check out — send us an email at &lt;strong&gt;shopping.editors@aol.com&lt;/strong&gt; and we'll write you back!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curious about how we test and choose products at AOL?

That recommendation was based on a clinical trial involving 386 participants, which found that those who took nicotinamide developed fewer new cases of skin cancer compared with those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanding the Evidence with a Larger Patient Group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, confirming those earlier findings in a much larger population has been difficult. Because nicotinamide is available over the counter, its use is rarely documented in medical records. To overcome that obstacle, researchers turned to the Veterans Affairs (VA) Corporate Data Warehouse, where nicotinamide is listed on the VA's official formulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using these records, the research team reviewed the outcomes of 33,833 veterans who received baseline treatment with 500 milligrams of nicotinamide twice daily for more than 30 days. They tracked each patient's next diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large Study Reveals Significant Risk Reduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those studied, 12,287 patients had taken nicotinamide, while 21,479 had not. The researchers found a 14% overall decrease in skin cancer risk among nicotinamide users. For those who began taking the supplement after experiencing their first skin cancer, the risk reduction jumped to 54%. However, this benefit lessened when treatment began after multiple skin cancers had already developed. The effect was strongest for squamous cell carcinoma, one of the most common nonmelanoma skin cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Use Could Shift Prevention Strategies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are no guidelines for when to start treatment with nicotinamide for skin cancer prevention in the general population. These results would really shift our practice from starting it once patients have developed numerous skin cancers to starting it earlier. We still need to do a better job of identifying who will actually benefit, as roughly only half of patients will develop multiple skin cancers,"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;said the study's corresponding author, Lee Wheless, MD, PhD, assistant professor of Dermatology and Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and staff physician at the VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Findings in Transplant Patients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also evaluated 1,334 patients who were immunocompromised due to solid organ transplants. In this group, overall risk reduction was not statistically significant, although early use of nicotinamide was linked to fewer cases of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research Collaboration and Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheless's work was supported by a Department of Veterans Affairs grant (IK2CX002452). Co-authors from Vanderbilt University included Katyln Knox, Rachel Weiss, Siwei Zhang, PhD, Lydia Yao, MS, Yaomin Xu, PhD, and Kyle Maas.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Large national surveys have linked religious or spiritual involvement with health, yet longitudinal evidence on life-changing experiences remains sparse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has associated religious or spiritual involvement with positive health indicators and lower stress, while qualitative and clinical literature has described both self-destabilizing elements and intensified &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/civic+engagement/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;civic engagement&lt;/a&gt; and social connectedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest in population-based longitudinal evidence has centered on whether these early spiritual experiences relate to later mental health, social functioning, and civic behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Between Vulnerability and Connection: Longitudinal Evidence on the Impact of Transformative Religious/Spiritual Experiences," &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smi.70110" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Stress and Health&lt;/i&gt;, researchers analyzed data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health to examine associations between transformative religious or &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/spiritual+experiences/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;spiritual experiences&lt;/a&gt; in late adolescence and a range of outcomes across physical, mental, behavioral, and social domains in early adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants numbered 10,529 after exclusions, spanning Wave I in 1994–1995 (&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/early+adolescence/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;early adolescence&lt;/a&gt;), Wave III in 2001–2002 (late adolescence), and Wave IV in 2008 (early adulthood). Eligibility required completion of Wave III and valid sampling weights at Wave IV, with 1,613 respondents excluded because reported transformative experiences occurred before Wave I. Group counts at Wave III were 8,731 without a reported transformative religious or spiritual experience and 1,798 with a reported experience.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Outcomes covered 38 indicators across &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+health/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical health&lt;/a&gt;, behavioral health, mental health and well-being, and social engagement assessed at early adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 17% of adolescents reported a transformative religious or spiritual experience during late adolescence. Childhood patterns included household financial strain, strained parent-child dynamics, lower academic indicators, elevated depressive symptoms, and greater religious practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reporting a transformative experience in late adolescence aligned with greater volunteering in early adulthood. Civic participation also rose, as rated by higher voting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loneliness increased in early &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/adulthood/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;adulthood&lt;/a&gt; among those who reported a transformative experience. Signals for PTSD diagnosis, lower self-rated health, more &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/depressive+symptoms/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;depressive symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, functional limitations, diabetes, and prescription drug misuse appeared but were less consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensitivity analyses using reduced covariates continued to show volunteering, voting, and loneliness. Models that incorporated contemporaneous covariates kept volunteering consistent and retained loneliness, voting, and PTSD under some specifications. Complete case analysis continued to show volunteering and loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors conclude that transformative experiences function as a double-edged phenomenon linking adolescent vulnerability with later civic and prosocial engagement. The findings imply value in attention to meaning-making and long-term integration while recognizing modest effect sizes and limits on causal inference.&lt;/p&gt;

These desserts, when prepared thoughtfully, provide natural prebiotics, healthy fats, and probiotics, all crucial for maintaining a balanced digestive system.

Getting back the ability to read is a major improvement in their quality of life, lifts their mood and helps to restore their confidence and independence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The trial found 84% of participants were once again able to read letters, numbers and words after being fitted with the implant, called the Prima device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Eye specialists hailed the results as “remarkable” and said the device could help people with the “dry” form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of sight loss in the over-50s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Moorfields said: “The revolutionary new implant is the first ever device to enable people to read letters, numbers and words through an eye that had lost its sight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The 38 patients all had geographic atrophy with dry AMD, which over time progressively deprives someone of their sight and for which there is no treatment. Most people with the condition lose some of their central vision and in some cases it progresses to full sight loss as the cells in the macula die and the central macula melts away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;All had lost their central vision and had only limited peripheral vision before they had the device implanted in an operation lasting less then two hours. Five were treated at Moorfields and the others at hospitals in Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sheila Wilson from Wiltshire, one of those who had the chip implanted at Moorfields, said: “Before receiving the implant it was like having two black discs in my eyes, with the outside distorted. I was an avid bookworm and I wanted that back. There was no pain during the operation but you’re still aware of what’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s made a big difference. It’s a new way of looking through your eyes and it was dead exciting when I began seeing a letter. It’s not simple, learning to read again, but the more hours I put in, the more I pick up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Prima device, a super-thin microchip that is just 2mm by 2mm in size, is inserted under the centre of the eye’s retina in a procedure known as a vitrectomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;To help them to see and write, patients were given augmented reality glasses containing a video camera connected to a small computer, which they attached to their waistband. It included a zoom feature to make text bigger and easier to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Patients can use the glasses to focus and scan the object in the projected image that they want to read. The glasses project the scenes as an infra-red beam across the chip, which activates the device. Artificial intelligence in the waistband computer processes the information and converts it into an electrical signal, which passes through the cells in the retina and optical nerve into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Muqit stressed that patients had to undergo training and intensive rehabilitation of their eye in order to realise the benefits of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s not like you’re popping a chip in the eye and then you can see again. You need to learn to use this type of vision,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The results of the trial are reported in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 12:29:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxQZWhCalptZS1PYUpfZU9oN0o3OWo4c3JOaFdlSnp2Y2RUZ25CYkk4cm56UWIycVRGaUxmdWpER09HZlpZVDdrR3Zncy1uV08tdGROYlhxZ3dKNGU4WmpVa2lNLTB5NHNHaUpHY3Zyd21haWMxZW1UVEpyQVQ1WFhHczNRdkFBcDFOVGE2RnUxLWpEQWdkS2dqNW1kQWVEdUcxSTBiSDk5U0lKZS1YakJseUlRVnhuVGZ3U0lsLQ</guid></item><item><title>由于疫苗接种率暴跌，佛罗里达州维多利亚时代百日咳病例飙升-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15203309/cases-whooping-cough-florida-vaccine-rates.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases of a Victorian-era disease have soared in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/florida/index.html" id="mol-c2e88db0-ab96-11f0-91b6-a7e7d42ed005"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; amid the state's ban on vaccine mandates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of September 27, the latest data available, there have been 1,295 cases of pertussis, also called whooping cough, in Florida, an 81 percent surge compared to the entirety of 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And nationwide, cases rose six-fold in 2024 compared to the year before, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-ad9ad6f0-ab98-11f0-91b6-a7e7d42ed005" class=""&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; figures show, a sign of waning immunity against a disease that once struck hundreds of thousands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The highly contagious respiratory virus, caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis, is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15050927/Baby-dies-whooping-cough-vaccination-rates.html"&gt;especially dangerous for infants and young children&lt;/a&gt; who are more prone to &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/pneumonia/index.html" id="mol-c2e5f5a0-ab96-11f0-91b6-a7e7d42ed005"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;, seizures, brain damage and death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even in non-fatal cases, older children and adults may suffer prolonged coughing fits so fierce that they lead to broken ribs, vomiting and trouble sleeping. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can be prevented with the Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis), which health authorities recommend at two, four, six and 15 to 18 months old, as well as ages four to six. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Preteens ages 11 to 12 should also be vaccinated against pertussis, and the shot is recommended every ten years after that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But vaccination against whooping cough has declined in the US. During the 2024-2025 school year, Tdap vaccination among kindergarteners dropped to 92 percent compared to 95 percent in 2019, the rate needed to achieve herd immunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Health officials have warned that whooping cough, which is extremely dangerous for young children and teens, is on the rise in Florida (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows the rate of whooping cough per county in Florida between February and April 2025, the latest data available &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Florida, Tdap vaccination rates were down to 90.6 percent in 2024, the lowest in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Tara Williams, a general academic pediatrician with the Orlando College of Osteopathic Medicine, told the USA TODAY Network Florida: 'We are setting up a cesspool of germs for our kids to walk into.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whooping cough's surge comes weeks after Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo announced the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15062445/florida-end-vaccine-mandates-ron-desantis-joseph-ladapo.html"&gt;state would ban all vaccine mandates for children&lt;/a&gt;, including Tdap, polio, hepatitis, Covid and measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Every last one of them is wrong and drips with disdain and slavery,' he said last month.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Tdap vaccine is 98 percent effective in children within a year of their last dose. In teenagers, the jab is 73 percent effective in the first year and 34 percent effective four years after vaccination.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whooping cough occurs when the bacteria Bordetella pertussis attaches to tiny hairs in the throat and nose and release toxins that cause airways to swell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At first, this may cause mild symptoms like a runny nose or mild cough, but it can progress to a cough so violent it leads many patients to vomit and develop breathing problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Polly Deehy (pictured left in the hospital) from the UK had to be placed in a ten-day coma after coming down with whooping cough. And at just one month old, Rosie Robin of the UK (pictured right) was hospitalized for two weeks with the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Health officials warned that the infection is initially difficult to tell apart from a cold, as the first signs are a runny nose and sore throat. But around a week later, sufferers may develop coughing bouts that last minutes, struggle to breathe after coughing and make a 'whoop' sound between coughs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prior to the introduction of the pertussis vaccine in 1948, the US saw as many as 250,000 cases of pertussis per year. Cases steadily dropped by more than 90 percent each year compared to the pre-vaccine era, the CDC states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC has also noted that the bacteria that causes whooping cough, Bordetella pertussis, is prone to mutations, which could make it able to evade vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Marcos Mestre, chief clinical operations officer at Nicklaus Children's Health System in Miami, told CBS last year: 'We have been seeing some increase in pertussis cases that are coming through our emergency departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Not necessarily requiring admission, but coming in for evaluation and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They're coughing to the point that they can't catch their breath. And those are the children we really worry about, when infants are getting infected and that could cause more severe illness.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            Do you often experience difficulty defecating? If the answer is yes, newly released recommendations may help relieve your symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qeb000i3b6nw1r2hvlt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kiwifruit, rye bread and high mineral-content water can help alleviate chronic constipation, according to &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jhn.70133" target="_blank"&gt;new dietary guidelines&lt;/a&gt; copublished October 13 by the Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics and Neurogastroenterology &amp;amp; Motility.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qeb000h3b6ncob49h9s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About &lt;a href="https://iffgd.org/gi-disorders/lower-gi-disorders/constipation/" target="_blank"&gt;1 out of every 6 to 7 people&lt;/a&gt; are affected by chronic constipation worldwide. In the United States, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7269025/" target="_blank"&gt;9% to 20% of adults&lt;/a&gt; have some form of chronic idiopathic constipation,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in which the cause of the condition&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is unknown.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qeb000j3b6n54hkzesh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/constipation/symptoms-causes/syc-20354253" target="_blank"&gt;symptoms of chronic constipation&lt;/a&gt; include having a bowel movement fewer than three times a week, hard or lumpy stool, or straining or experiencing pain when pooping.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qeb000l3b6n3uiboa2j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The guidelines “introduce foods and drinks (e.g., kiwifruit, prunes, rye bread, high mineral content water) and specific supplement interventions into clinical guidance, filling a long-standing gap between research and routine clinical advice,” lead study author Dr. Eirini Dimidi said in an email. “That will help clinicians give clearer, more targeted, and evidence-informed dietary advice, and will allow people to self-manage their symptoms more effectively.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qeb000m3b6nf4r7xob5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The guidance applies to healthy adults with &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2013/08/28/health/gi-disorders-ibs-cic"&gt;chronic idiopathic constipation&lt;/a&gt; and “did not focus on constipation secondary to other conditions (e.g., neurological disease, pregnancy), so while some recommendations may be applicable, they should be used with caution in these groups, as well as in children,” said Dimidi, an associate professor in nutritional sciences at King’s College London.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qeb000n3b6ngxw8q3z0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The guidelines did not include a general recommendation for increased fiber intake in a patient’s diet. Rather, they focused on specific foods that could be beneficial, Dimidi added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000o3b6nks0tyjjn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Certain &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4059-constipation" target="_blank"&gt;lifestyle choices or situations&lt;/a&gt;, such as low fiber intake, dehydration, lack of exercise, or stress, can cause constipation. As a result, clinicians focus most treatment on dietary changes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000p3b6nkiu9v0bf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Previous dietary advice was broad, such as telling patients to eat more fiber. But these new guidelines, Dimidi said, suggest “incorporating evidence-based foods and drinks in your diet, such as consuming 2-3 kiwifruits a day.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000q3b6nyrl7zt33@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unlike other recommended food such as prunes, kiwifruit is simple to incorporate into your diet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000r3b6nhaw2jqlr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “With kiwifruit, because it’s so well-tolerated, you usually can just step right into that dose, as opposed to prunes, for example, where you want to more gradually work up to that dose of six to eight prunes per day,” said Dr. William Chey, professor and chief of gastroenterology and hepatology at the University of Michigan. He was not involved in the new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000s3b6n5y2tb07c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6267416/" target="_blank"&gt;Kiwis can increase stool bulk&lt;/a&gt; and water content, enhance protein digestion, and smoothen the movement of food, fluids and waste in the digestive tract. The small fruits also improve the amount of time it takes for waste to pass through your intestine and have natural prebiotic effects, such as improved digestion and reduced gut inflammation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000t3b6nmt66pxhb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kiwis are also palatable and soft, which makes them easy to eat, said Dr. Cuckoo Choudhary, the Dorrance H. Hamilton Professor of Medicine at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia. She was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000u3b6nh9jy0heg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            You can also eat a kiwi’s skin or peel, which has extra fiber. But avoid heating a kiwi, since high temperatures destroy the enzyme that smoothens gut movement, Choudhary added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000v3b6nmkmvq1n0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Foods such as prunes, rye bread, flaxseeds, oranges, yogurt, beans and oatmeal &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/05/18/health/foods-for-constipation"&gt;can also help&lt;/a&gt; with chronic constipation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000w3b6ncyd4t6et@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For those who like dairy, you could “take a cup of yogurt, make it 8 ounces, any yogurt of your choice because all yogurts have probiotics, and take a heaped tablespoon full of crushed flaxseeds,” said Choudhary, an expert with the American Gastroenterological Association.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000x3b6n9ozxl3ub@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other alternatives include dietary supplements, such as &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/18922-psyllium-powder-for-solution" target="_blank"&gt;psyllium&lt;/a&gt;, which helps your intestine move stool along and reduces your body’s cholesterol absorption from food.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000y3b6n2x0au123@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That dosage is at least 10 grams of fiber per day. And again, the general rule is, start low and go slow. So start with 3 grams and gradually work your way up to 10 plus grams per day of psyllium to achieve the benefits,” said Chey, incoming president of the American College of Gastroenterology.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000z3b6nt9lvzh94@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11583288/" target="_blank"&gt;Physical activity&lt;/a&gt; is also an important lifestyle change that patients with chronic constipation can incorporate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec00103b6n7ov5pipc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even something as simple as walking&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;increases the effectiveness of the digestive tract&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;Choudhary said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec00113b6npxjdgcii@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new recommendations were based on findings of four systematic reviews and meta-analyses that looked at over 75 randomized controlled trials of dietary interventions for chronic constipation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Navigating this while traveling becomes trickier. We are perpetually inundated with single-use plastic options. The plethora of plastic water bottles stacked at every airport shop, kiosk, or roadside convenience store comes with a hidden cost: microplastics. These tiny particles, often invisible to the eye, are increasingly found in bottled water, tap systems, and even the food we eat.

The wide mouth on this 24-ounce bottle makes adding ice a breeze, while the large opening simplifies cleaning. The brand claims that the bottle will keep drinks cold for up to 24 hours and beverages hot for about half as long, making this a solid choice for trails, travel, or long days at the office.

According to Brandon, “I needed a water bottle that was small and could fit in my purse and wouldn’t get gross during my travels. It’s made of 65 percent recycled materials, including 90 percent recycled stainless steel. As a bonus, every purchase funds the cleanup of 1,000 ocean-bound plastic bottles.”

Even better, the membrane lasts up to 1,000 gallons, which is more than enough to provide years of reliable service. And the filter is replaceable when the time comes or when your next destination may have questionable water sources.

To further protect it from accidental slips and bumps, the bottle sports a protective non-slip silicone sleeve, while the leak-proof stainless steel lid eliminates leaks. For those with more discerning taste buds, there is no metallic aftertaste and zero chemical concerns. It’s dishwasher safe and comes in an array of vibrant colors.

And while this sports bottle also comes in 16-, 20-, and 24-ounce models, I really like the larger size as it helps me attain my daily hydration goals with the higher capacity. And while the screw-on cap is comprised of BPA-free, durable, and food-safe polypropylene, Brandon recommends always hand-washing the tops and not leaving them out in the sun, as UV light can break down even the best plastics.

Granted, the plastics used now are much safer than those that I used over 40 years ago. Made in the U.S., the newest iterations of this classic wide-mouth bottle are manufactured with BPA and BPS-free food-safe Tritan plastic. And, this iconic and nearly indestructible water bottle is paired with a built-in filter that removes up to 99.99 percent of tap water contaminants—including microplastics.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_79-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Travel often disrupts our daily habits, and hydration is one of the first routines to change. When you’re rushing through an airport or exploring a new city, grabbing a bottle of water is often the most convenient choice. But research has shown that bottled water can contain far higher concentrations of microplastics than tap water.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_80-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_81-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to Brandon, single-use bottled water is one of the most common sources of plastic trash, as well as one of our biggest sources of microplastic consumption. On average, there are 60 times more microplastics in bottled water than in tap water. And a lot of that plastic is from the bottle and the cap itself! Each twist of the cap can produce 500 microplastics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_82-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_83-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Studies have shown that microplastics are present in over 90 percent of sampled bottled water, making it a hidden but widespread concern for travelers worldwide,” states Jean-Luc Madier, Director of Engineering at &lt;a href="https://lifestraw.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;LifeStraw&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_84-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_85-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Single-use plastics are about 40 to 50 percent of the plastic waste problem in general (numbers vary), which is huge,” Brandon added. “And then, when you think about microplastics, they are a huge part of the problem, because they are made of very cheap plastic, so they are not made to last. Not all plastic is the same. Single-use plastic is thinner and cheaper, and will break down into microplastics a lot faster than plastic that is made to be used for a long time.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_86-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_87-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is why choosing a safe, reusable water bottle isn’t just about sustainability—it’s also about reducing the ways microplastics find their way into your body. There is good news, though: By educating yourself about what to carry and how to use it, you can cut down your risk dramatically, no matter where your trip takes you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_88-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-choosing-the-right-water-bottle-to-avoid-microplastics"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_89-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block travelandleisure-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Choosing the Right Water Bottle to Avoid Microplastics &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_90-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to Brandon, not all reusable bottles are created equal. There is a significant difference in quality between the plastic used in a Hydro Flask or Nalgene versus the cheap plastic of an athletic squirt bottle or a free reusable plastic bottle you'd get at a conference or festival. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_91-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_92-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As mentioned earlier, the material matters most. &lt;strong&gt;Stainless steel&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;glass bottles&lt;/strong&gt; are generally considered the safest choices since they don’t shed particles or leach chemicals, even when exposed to heat or frequent washing. If you prefer plastic for its lighter weight, look for high-quality, BPA-free options and replace them as soon as they show scratches, cloudiness, or wear—signs that microplastic shedding could be occurring.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_93-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_94-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Stainless steel is very safe and durable,” states Brandon. “Glass is incredibly safe, but obviously a bit more breakable. BPA-free plastic is important because BPA is an endocrine mimic-er that can affect our hormone levels, causing reproductive issues, metabolic disorders, and may increase rates of breast cancer and other types of cancer. But there are other additives in plastic besides BPA, so that is not the only thing to look out for.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_96-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Filtration is another key feature to consider, particularly for international travel. Some brands now offer built-in filters that can remove not only bacteria, viruses, and protozoans, but also reduce microplastic levels from tap water and other questionable sources.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_98-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Finally, care plays a big role. Brandon says, “Washing your bottle by hand with mild soap and avoiding extreme heat (like dishwashers) will extend its life and reduce the risk of particle breakdown. I would recommend always hand-washing the tops and dishwashing the bottles (as relates to the stainless steel and glass bottles). And don't leave them out in the sun. Ultraviolet  light will always start to degrade even the best plastics.”

The research suggests that the cognitive process of making novel associations—called associative thinking—helps explain why people with high creativity tend to perform better on learning tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creativity is often considered essential in education and professional life. Past research has shown that creativity is positively linked to academic achievement. However, less is known about how creativity actually supports learning at the cognitive level. The authors of the new study proposed that associative thinking might play a key role. This is the ability to connect different ideas or concepts, which is often seen as a hallmark of creative thought. They suspected that this same ability could also help people learn, particularly when it comes to tasks that require forming new associations, like matching a foreign word with its English translation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the theoretical connection, no previous research had directly tested whether associative thinking is the link between creativity and learning. The researchers aimed to fill this gap by testing whether students who show higher levels of associative thinking also do better at learning tasks. They also wanted to see whether this effect holds even when controlling for general intelligence, which is known to influence both learning and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Creativity has often been linked to academic learning, yet little is known about the mechanisms underlying their relationship,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.simoneluchini.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Simone Luchini&lt;/a&gt;, a PhD student at Penn State University and an incoming postdoctoral researcher at the Paris Brain Institute. “In our work, we wanted to explore if associative thinking could underlie this link. Associative thinking involves connecting distant concepts or ideas in memory. For example, the concepts of ‘dog’ and ‘cat’ are highly related, while ‘dog’ and ‘plane’ are less related. Does the ability to generate these distant connections allow creative individuals to learn better?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore these questions, the researchers conducted two studies with undergraduate students. In both, participants completed a language learning task that required them to memorize pairs of Lithuanian and English words. They were then tested on how well they remembered the word pairs after 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first study, 146 students completed the language learning task and a word association test that measured associative thinking. In this test, they were shown a series of nouns and asked to come up with verbs that were meaningfully connected but not commonly linked with the noun. For example, given the word “boot,” a creative response might be “travel” instead of a more typical response like “wear.” These responses were analyzed using a computational model that scores how semantically distant the noun-verb pair is. The greater the semantic distance, the more novel the association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that students who generated more semantically distant associations recalled more word pairs, both immediately and after a 24-hour delay. This held true even after accounting for their scores on tests of fluid and crystallized intelligence. These findings suggest that associative thinking plays a distinct role in learning beyond general mental ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second study included 145 new participants and extended the investigation in several ways. In addition to the language learning and word association tasks, students also completed creative tasks, such as writing short stories and drawing sketches. These tasks were scored using automated systems that assess the novelty and integration of ideas in text and images. The researchers again found that students who performed better on the associative thinking task recalled more words after 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the second study distinguished between two kinds of associations: free association, where participants responded with any related verb that came to mind, and goal-directed association, where they were instructed to think creatively and produce more novel connections. The researchers found that only goal-directed associative thinking predicted learning outcomes. This suggests that intentional creative thinking is more relevant for learning than simply making quick or obvious connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also looked at whether creativity influenced learning through associative thinking. Statistical modeling showed that associative thinking partly explained the link between creativity (measured by the drawing and writing tasks and personality measures related to openness) and learning. When they controlled for intelligence, the data indicated that associative thinking fully accounted for the relationship between creativity and learning. In other words, creativity helped learning primarily through the ability to form distant, meaningful associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We find that associative thinking mediates the link between creativity and learning,” Luchini told PsyPost. “In other words, how good a person is at connecting these distant concepts in memory determines whether their creativity can translate into better learning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings also point to a distinction between spontaneous associations and more deliberate creative thinking. While people can often make quick associations without much effort, it is the more thoughtful, inventive connections that appear to help with memory and learning. This may have implications for education, suggesting that encouraging students to think in more creative and flexible ways could improve their ability to retain new information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study provides new insight into how creativity supports learning, it comes with some limitations. The research relied on a specific type of learning task—memorizing foreign vocabulary—which may not represent all forms of learning. It is unclear whether the same findings would apply to learning in other areas, such as math, science, or visual-spatial tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also used a college student sample from psychology courses, which may limit how widely the results can be applied. Future studies could test whether the findings hold in other age groups, educational settings, or cultural contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study was conducted online, so we want to extend our research to a more realistic setting by testing students in their classrooms,” Luchini noted. “We hope that our work will inform classroom practices. This kind of research can be used to facilitate learning, by treating each student as an individual with their own strengths and weaknesses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors also suggest that future studies explore the neural basis of these effects. Understanding the brain mechanisms involved in associative thinking could help explain why some people are better at learning through creativity than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To clarify, we think of creativity as a standard measure of individual differences, much like intelligence or personality,” Luchini explained. “While creativity is certainly malleable, there is a stable degree of creative ability that we capture with our psychological tests, which then informs our research questions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41539-025-00334-1" target="_blank"&gt;Creativity supports learning through associative thinking&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Simone A.

In Asia, the flu has made an early comeback, and quickly swelled to epidemic proportions in Japan and Taiwan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And stateside, some experts are sounding the alarm about continued lower uptake of the flu vaccine. There’s also the possibility of a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-09-03/as-covid-wave-washes-over-california-some-health-officials-urge-residents-to-mask-up"&gt;seasonal COVID-19 wave&lt;/a&gt; — the likes of which didn’t materialize last winter, but had been commonplace since the pandemic — as well as a simultaneous rise in &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-11-22/what-to-know-about-the-new-rsv-shot-for-babies"&gt;respiratory syncytial virus&lt;/a&gt;, or RSV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California health officials have previously &lt;a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/JfEbRVAvIys?si=Kh5upr2sXpQFulQk&amp;amp;t=354" target="_blank"&gt;forecast&lt;/a&gt; that this fall-and-winter’s respiratory virus season is expected to be similar to last year’s. If that’s the case, flu would again be the dominant virus fueling hospital admissions compared to COVID-19 and RSV. During the winters of 2022-23 and 2023-24, COVID made up the majority of California hospital admissions caused by respiratory viruses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having people get vaccinated is going to be really key for influenza,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UC San Francisco infectious diseases expert. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While flu, COVID and RSV are currently at low levels in California, there are signs that respiratory virus season is starting to gear up as temperatures drop and people spend more time indoors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to rates recorded in the summer, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has seen increases in people reporting cough, fever, chills, aches, sore throat and runny nose, officials said, citing a text-based health &lt;a class="link" href="https://ph.lacounty.gov/acd/respwatch/#Angelenos" target="_blank"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;. The test positivity rate for rhinoviruses and enteroviruses, which typically cause the common cold, is 19.87%. That’s higher than that of the virus that causes COVID-19, 4.2%; or the flu, 1.04%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In San Francisco, doctors have seen the number of colds being reported in the hospital double, Chin-Hong said. Some workplaces in the Bay Area have seen a number of employees call out sick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With RSV, flu and COVID-19 rates expected to climb by the holidays, “this is a perfect time to get immunized,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fall and winter of 2024-25 brought the nation’s &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2025-2026-influenza-activity.html#:~:text=The%20Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control,of%20the%202024%E2%80%9325%20season" target="_blank"&gt;worst&lt;/a&gt; flu season in many years, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of children who died from flu last season was the highest since the H1N1 swine flu pandemic season of 2009-10, according to a recent &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; published in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Officials reported 280 confirmed deaths among children last season, and about 9 in 10 of those kids were not vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials became particularly concerned about reports of a rare, severe complication that targets the brain — influenza-associated encephalopathy, or &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;IAE&lt;/a&gt;, which was reported in 109 children nationally last season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three in four children with IAE needed intensive care treatment. The median age of children with IAE was 5, and 55% of those diagnosed with the condition had no underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of those children, 37 had acute necrotizing encephalopathy, or ANE, a particularly severe form of the disease that results in rapid neurologic decline. Two in five children with ANE died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 1 in 6 of the kids with IAE who were eligible to be vaccinated had gotten the flu shot, health officials say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC recommends that everyone age 6 months and up get a flu vaccine. New this year, officials are allowing people to order &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-nasal-spray-influenza-vaccine-self-or-caregiver-administration" target="_blank"&gt;FluMist&lt;/a&gt; to be mailed to them at home. FluMist is approved for people ages 2 through 49 and administered by nasal spray rather than injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors have been concerned about declining flu vaccination levels. As of late April, just 49.2% of children had gotten a flu shot, lower than the 53.4% who had done so at the same point the previous season, according to preliminary national &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;survey results&lt;/a&gt;. Both figures are much lower than the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/interactive/general-population-coverage.html" target="_blank"&gt;final flu vaccination rate&lt;/a&gt; for vaccine-eligible children during the 2019-20 season, which was 63.7%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among adults, 46.7% had gotten their flu shot, slightly down from the 47.4% at the same point last season, according to the preliminary survey results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before the COVID-19 pandemic, flu vaccination coverage had been slowly increasing; downturns in coverage occurred during and after the pandemic. Flu vaccination levels have not rebounded to pre-pandemic levels,” the CDC &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early data from the Southern Hemisphere indicate that the flu shot’s effectiveness was decent this season — cutting the risk of &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a3.htm?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank"&gt;hospitalization&lt;/a&gt; by 50%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asia is already reporting plenty of flu cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For influenza right now, it’s raging in Asia,” Chin-Hong said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu is considered to be at epidemic levels in &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/16071642" target="_blank"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; — where news reports say this was the second-earliest start to the season in 20 years — and in Taiwan. Hong Kong health officials have described the flu situation in September and October, before shots became widely available, as “&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3329312/hong-kong-faces-relatively-severe-summer-flu-outbreak-health-authorities-warn" target="_blank"&gt;relatively severe&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation there could provide a glimpse of how the flu season will play out in California and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the San Francisco Bay Area, officials are also closely monitoring “high” levels in wastewater of a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-09-14/la-oc-health-departments-warn-about-enterovirus-ev-d68"&gt;specific kind of cold virus&lt;/a&gt; — enterovirus D68, or EV-D68. In rare cases, that virus can cause polio-like paralysis in children called acute flaccid myelitis, or AFM. High levels were reported in a large swath of the Silicon Valley and San Francisco, according to &lt;a class="link" href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/?charts=CjEQACABSABaBUVWRDY4cgoyMDI1LTA5LTA1cgoyMDI1LTEwLTE3igEGNTY3MWZjwAEB&amp;amp;selectedChartId=5671fc&amp;amp;plantId=c8d357b9&amp;amp;target=EVD68&amp;amp;selectedLocation=%7B%22label%22%3A%22San%20Jose,%20CA%22,%22level%22%3A%22plant%22,%22value%22%3A%22c8d357b9%22%7D" target="_blank"&gt;WastewaterSCAN&lt;/a&gt;. High levels have also been found in sewage in western San Bernardino County, including Ontario, Chino and Fontana. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The L.A. County Department of Public Health has not yet detected increased signals of EV-D68, and no cases of AFM have been reported this year in Los Angeles or Orange counties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That virus can transmit through an infected person’s saliva and mucus and likely spreads “when an infected person coughs, sneezes or touches a surface that is then touched by others,” the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents should call a doctor if their child suffers any symptoms of &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/about/about-enterovirus-d68.html" target="_blank"&gt;AFM&lt;/a&gt;, which include slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, difficulty moving the eyes, drooping eyelids, pain in the neck, back, arms or legs, weakness in the arm or legs or facial droop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To protect yourself against respiratory viruses, experts recommend getting vaccinated, washing your hands often, keeping rooms well-ventilated, wearing face masks in crowded indoor public settings, and staying away from sick people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Public Health &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/publichealth4all/vaccines.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; updated COVID-19 vaccines for everyone age 6 months to 23 months, seniors age 65 and up; as well as older children, teenagers and adults who either have risk factors for severe COVID, or are in close contact with at-risk people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children who have never been inoculated against COVID-19 should also get the vaccine, as should pregnant women and anyone else who wants to get the shot, the state says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RSV immunizations are recommended for everyone age 75 and up, babies younger than 8 months, and pregnant women between 32 weeks to 36 weeks of gestation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immunizations are also recommended for adults age 50 to 74 with risk factors, as well as babies with risk factors between 8 months and 19 months. Older adults who have been previously immunized against RSV generally don’t need to get another vaccine, according to current guidelines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxQWnVtWDhxeTRmMC0zT2l1TzNkSFpJR3NCQi1QcFhwMENFQjVpUFBhTDVadFg5M3RNYmRwSjFKbEgzZTdUeHp5dm0tRE9MbGpWRWotUmJYeC1ReWxrZjN2d2c0QUdVNlRkenBJc0M1RnREeU5hVUdfc2lPd0h1cy1IaFkzSjRYRTVOQms1d1pOUzdSR1FQQWJ0U1dYWG90OS14</guid></item><item><title>Sadhguru透露，晚上半勺这种油可以自然地清洁结肠-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/sadhguru-reveals-that-half-a-spoon-of-this-oil-at-night-can-cleanse-the-colon-naturally/articleshow/124702897.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lifestyle we live, many of us will face struggles with sluggishness, poor digestion, or a general feeling of heaviness. According to Sadhguru, these issues often trace back to one simple factor: an unclean colon. He emphasises that a clean system is essential for staying alert, vibrant, and full of life. And surprisingly, the key to achieving this might already be sitting quietly in the kitchen, castor oil, a remedy rooted in South Indian tradition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The connection between colon cleanliness and vitality&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadhguru explains that the body’s vibrancy is deeply connected to the state of the colon. When waste matter stays longer than it should, it affects not just digestion but also energy levels and mental clarity. The body begins to carry an “inertia,” a sense of dullness that weighs down both physical and emotional wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Cure 90% of Diseases by Fixing Just TWO Things – Sadhguru Reveals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping the colon clean, he says, allows the system to stay light and the mind alert. It’s not merely about detox; it’s about maintaining balance between the body’s natural processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Sadhguru recommends castor oil&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In southern India, castor oil has long been used as a natural cleanser. Sadhguru refers to it as a simple, almost magical, element for maintaining inner cleanliness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to him, taking half a spoon of warm castor oil mixed with water or milk at night can help naturally cleanse the colon while supporting the lymphatic system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lymphatic system plays a crucial role in removing toxins and maintaining immune health. When this system becomes sluggish, toxins accumulate, leading to fatigue and dullness. Castor oil, being mildly laxative and anti-inflammatory, can help keep this system active and the body free from unnecessary stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How it works: Activating the body’s natural flow&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadhguru highlights that the body’s vitality depends on how freely energy and fluids move within. When the colon and lymphatic systems work efficiently, energy circulates better. Castor oil, in this context, is not a “quick fix” but a supportive aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its natural compounds stimulate gentle bowel movement, clear out residual waste, and reduce internal heaviness.

Castor oil has been used in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ayurveda" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Ayurveda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; for cleansing and healing, but Sadhguru’s approach simplifies it for daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He reminds that a body free from internal clutter functions better, not just physically but mentally too. The mind becomes clearer, and the sense of vitality returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Sadhguru’s words, “Colon not being clean and the inability to be vibrant are very related.” This small, mindful practice of taking warm castor oil at night, he suggests, can be a gentle step toward keeping the body clean and the mind awake. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the simplest habits rooted in tradition hold the most profound benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is based on Sadhguru’s teachings and traditional wellness practices.

&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been doing it all my life. I gotta see for myself,” he said. “But as far as trying to make a living, you can’t do it, not any more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mansi converted his lobster wholesale facility on the dock in Guilford into a restaurant in the early 2000s. In the upstairs office on a sunny September morning, there are a few reminders of the life he used to lead: a “Captain’s Quarters” sign, framed photos from his lobstering heyday, the mast of his son’s fishing boat swaying gently out the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His eyes lit up as he recalled the good days. “We saw a lot of lobsters, a real lot of lobsters,” Mansi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-iLgdKCFX" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_iLgdKCFX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(Dana Edwards / CT Mirror)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s and ’90s, &lt;a href="https://www.guilfordlobsterpound.com/"&gt;Mansi&lt;/a&gt; was making a killing, along with the roughly 1,200 commercial lobstermen on Long Island Sound. The Sound was the third most-productive lobster fishery in the country, with 10 million pounds of lobster landings at its peak in 1998, including 3.8 million pounds in Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the fall of 1999, lobstermen pulled up traps filled with limp, sickly lobsters, and soon after, hardly any lobsters at all. It was an unprecedented mortality event, and the lobster population never recovered. Connecticut saw only 181,000 pounds of lobster landings in 2024, less than 5% of the 1998 peak. Now most seafood restaurants in the state — including Mansi’s — import lobster from Maine or Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catastrophic die-off is still an emotional subject for Mansi and so many former lobstermen. In addition to the painful memory of losing their livelihoods practically overnight, resentment lingers about how it happened. The scientific &lt;a href="https://portal.ct.gov/ceq/ar-23-gold/2023-ceq-annual-report-ebook/water-quality---rivers-lakes-and-estuaries/warming-and-rising-waters-of-long-island-sound"&gt;consensus is that warming waters,&lt;/a&gt; and an epidemic of a crustacean disease called paramoebiasis, were the primary culprits — and that pesticides used to combat West Nile virus may have had an additional effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;a href="https://portal.ct.gov/deep/fishing/fisheries-management/lobster-assessment"&gt;catastrophe was complex and unprecedented&lt;/a&gt;, and not all scientists agree on which factors were the most significant. The lobstermen almost unanimously blame the pesticides, and they feel betrayed by the chemical manufacturers, the marine scientists, and the government — whose tightening regulations they resented and whose financial assistance they found inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;In the early 2000s, as they fought for accountability and answers, the lobstermen had no choice but to adapt to the new reality. Some switched to fishing, clamming or catching conch, but most sold their boats and left the fishing docks behind entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there are no full-time commercial lobstermen left in Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are still a few part-timers. In the southeasternmost corner of the state, the Stonington port is home to seven active lobster boats. Other than one boat in New London, Stonington is the last bastion of commercial lobstering in Connecticut. Roddy Grimshaw is one of the few in Stonington still at it, a man of 29 who goes lobstering with his dad and a small crew a few days a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just lobstering that’s in decline — all forms of commercial fishing are under threat as luxury development supplants the docks once home to a vibrant blue-collar fishing culture.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Grimshaw put it this way: “The way I see it, if we don’t stay active … this will become just another yacht club.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The heyday&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mansi has fond memories of fishing with his family as a kid growing up in East Haven in the late 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just loved being out on the water, the freedom,” he said. At that time, the Connecticut lobster industry was picking up steam after a decades-long lull around the turn of the century. His dad wasn’t a lobsterman, more of a recreational fisherman, but, eyeing the hauls of lobstermen down at the docks, he decided to give it a shot. He started working on a friend’s father’s lobster boat while he was in high school in the 1970s. Then, in 1983, he bought his own boat, the Jani M.— named after his wife — and went into business for himself. And business was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you left the dock, you knew you were gonna catch lobsters. It was exciting. You’re dying to pull that first trap to see what was in it. And, you know, they were almost always full,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the ’80s and ’90s, Mansi was landing up to 100,000 pounds per year on just his boat, over 50% of the state’s entire 2024 haul. At a market price of $3 per pound, he was making a killing. He also started the Guilford Lobster Pound, a wholesaler that bought lobster from other fishermen and sold it to Connecticut retailers and restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mansi described a vibrant waterfront community at the Guilford Marina and at fishing docks across the state. He pointed to a newspaper article framed on his wall, which told the story of a fellow Guilford lobsterman who suffered a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We got six lobstermen all together, and we ended up going out and pulling all his gear. We brought all his lobsters to the pound here, we sold his lobsters, and we gave him a check. We all stuck together,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mansi wasn’t the only one to turn a high school lobstering job into a lucrative career in those years. Some 30 miles down the Sound in Norwalk, Gary Whetmore grew up lobstering with his dad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My father lobstered on a very small scale, and then I got into it on a much bigger scale,” Whetmore said. “I remember swapping lobsters with a gym teacher to get out of classes.”&lt;/p&gt;

“It was fun. It wasn’t work. The money was great, but it was the freedom of it. You could make as much or as little as you wanted to make. And if you worked hard enough, you could have anything you want in the world,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might think that the accelerating lobster hauls in those days — a roughly six-fold increase in Connecticut from the 1970s to the 1990s — risked depleting the lobster population. Counterintuitively, the reverse was true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There were a lot of lobsters,” Whetmore continued, “but it wasn’t natural.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecticut lobstermen from that era describe their work not as catching lobsters but, rather, “farming”  them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We were feeding them and letting them go,” Whetmore said. Indeed, in the ’80s and ’90s, lobstermen were stuffing millions of pounds of bait fish — pogy, mackerel, and others — into tens of thousands of traps in Long Island Sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The influx of bait represented a huge supplement to the lobsters’ natural food sources, artificially increasing the population to levels never before seen in the Sound. It was great for business, but scientists say the crowded crustacean conditions on the seafloor, combined with the unnaturally young population — lobstermen harvested them as soon as they reached the minimum size required by regulation — likely left them more vulnerable to the disease that decimated the population in the late ’90s. It was the boom before the bust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was not sustainable. Something was going to give,” Whetmore said. “There were no big lobsters here. As soon as they were legal, we harvested them. We’re feeding them, we’re growing them, and we’re harvesting, and whoever worked the hardest harvested the most. And that’s as simple as it was.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was really, really good, and when it ended, it ended,” Whetmore said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mansi spoke of the sudden die-off with a similar sense of finality. “You go out there one day, and that’s it. Overnight, it was done. It was ended,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The die-off&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the years leading up to the widespread die-off in the fall of 1999, there were early signs of trouble. Two localized lobster mortality events occurred in the &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287002284_The_1999_Long_Island_Sound_Lobster_mortality_event_Findings_of_the_Comprehensive_Research_Initiative"&gt;western Sound, f&lt;/a&gt;rom Norwalk to Greenwich, in 1997 and 1998.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whetmore, just a few miles further east, took heed of those early warnings. “I heard about the die-off getting as far up as Greenwich in ’98. And I told my guys that were working for me: If it happens next year, and it comes this way, we’re done. And sure enough, it got here,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 1999, dead lobsters started washing up on beaches along the Sound. On Sept. 16, Tropical Storm Floyd hit the region, dumping up to 12 inches of rain into the Sound in just two days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the following week, Long Island Sound’s lobster industry practically collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A week after the storm, when I went out, the lobsters in the pots were nothing but goo. It smelled. It was nothing but lobster parts,” said Tony Carlo, a Darien lobsterman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287002284_The_1999_Long_Island_Sound_Lobster_mortality_event_Findings_of_the_Comprehensive_Research_Initiative"&gt;Western Sound was hit the hardest,&lt;/a&gt; that fall experiencing a 99% reduction in lobster landings compared to the previous year. Ports in the east of the Sound saw reductions of 64% to 91%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, neither the lobstermen nor marine scientists had a clear understanding of the cause. A New York Times headline on Oct. 18, 1999, read, “Scientists Are Mystified by Deaths Of Lobsters in Long Island.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was a suspicious coincidence. In August, just a month before the storm, the government began applying pesticides, including resmethrin and methoprene, across Connecticut and New York to curb the spread of West Nile Virus. Because lobsters are related to insects, which the pesticides were designed to kill, many suspected that the runoff from the storm poisoned the lobsters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2000, a “commercial fishery failure” was declared in the Sound, and the federal government authorized $13.9 million to provide economic relief for the lobstermen and to fund research into the causes of the disaster. Over 20 research projects across a slew of institutions and agencies were approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the studies concluded by 2004, a clearer picture emerged. A parasitic amoeba, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8145359/"&gt;Neoparamoeba pemaquidensis,&lt;/a&gt; had infected and killed the lobsters. But it wasn’t just the disease. Researchers referred to a &lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/2017/03/16/proposals-aim-to-restore-lobsters-to-long-island-sound/"&gt;“perfect storm” of contributing factors.&lt;/a&gt; Years of above-average water temperatures weakened the immune systems of the lobsters, which are extremely sensitive to temperature increases. The storm may have accelerated the die-off by churning up the waters, bringing warmer temperatures to the already sick lobsters. Furthermore, the unnaturally high and primarily juvenile population was particularly vulnerable to infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you have a bunch of young animals all together, just like a cold in a classroom at school, the disease spreads through them pretty quickly,” said biologist Nancy Balcom, associate director of Connecticut Sea Grant, who was involved in research after the die-off and published several articles summarizing the findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the decades since 1999, the lobster population would appear to rebound in some years with a new crop of juvenile lobsters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But then a few years later, you didn’t see the adults,” Balcom said. This is consistent with the finding that the water is just getting too warm for the lobsters to tolerate, even though the paramoebiosis epidemic has passed. Long Island Sound has historically been the southernmost tip of the inshore range of the American lobster. With global warming, that map is being redrawn, and their range may soon terminate in Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The pesticides&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of the pesticides loomed large immediately after the die-off. Toxicology testing and several modeling exercises were conducted, but even the “worst case scenario” model indicated that the concentration of the chemicals never reached lethal levels for the lobsters. The scientific consensus is that the pesticides were not the primary cause of the die-off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That consensus, however, is not ironclad, and most of the lobstermen don’t buy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The pesticides are what killed them,” Mansi said. “We actually see what’s going on. We were there, and we’re telling you what we saw. They [the scientists] have never been on the water, they just sit in a lab and they make up these models that we have to adhere to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing of the pesticide application and the storm runoff was uncanny, and the lobstermen observed strange, hyperactive behavior in some living lobsters they caught after the die-off, as well as in certain species of crabs. Mansi helped recruit a biologist the lobstermen considered one of their own, Dr. Robert Bayer of Maine’s Lobster Institute. Bayer came down to Connecticut, performed his own tests, and concluded that the lobsters hauled alive during the 1999 event “showed the behaviors, classic behaviors, of pesticide poisoning — which is hyperactivity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the months and years that followed, while the government-funded studies were still underway, the lobstermen initiated a class action lawsuit against Cheminova and other pesticide makers, eventually receiving two settlements, for $12.5 million and $3.75 million. The lobstermen see the settlement as a vindication of their hypothesis, while Balcom says the pesticide makers never admitted to causing the die-off and merely settled to make the lawsuit go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the pesticides were the primary cause of death, they would have received probably lots more money,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarsila Seara, a social scientist who studies fishing communities, views the science as less settled, and she understands the animosity Mansi and many other lobstermen still feel towards the biologists, the pesticide companies and the government. In 2019, while a professor at the University of New Haven, she interviewed 20 former lobstermen and published two papers about the social impacts of the die-off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was a dismissal of their experience and the knowledge that the fishermen were trying to bring to the table,” Seara said. “It should have been dealt with differently.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The reality is that it was a very complex combination of factors, and the lobstermen really wanted to find the one thing that they could blame, and they were naturally upset because there was no backing of that one culprit,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tony Carlo and Roger Frate, cousins who started lobstering in the 1970s in central Connecticut, were active in the fight against the pesticide companies in the early 2000s. Frate now runs the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/darienseafood/"&gt;Darien Seafood Market&lt;/a&gt; with Carlo’s help. Alongside tanks with live lobsters (now imported from Maine or Canada), the store has multiple display cases with newspaper articles documenting the die-off and ensuing legal battles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two cousins are still angry at the chemical makers, politicians and marine scientists they see as responsible for causing — or failing to address — the destruction of their livelihood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We lost everything within a three-week period,” Carlo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We fought in Washington, Hartford, Boston … we fought against some big people at the chemical companies. We kept going for years and years,” Frate said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frate and Carlo see the government’s regulatory response in the 2000s — mandating an increase in “gauge” size (a device used to measure the minimum-sized lobsters legal to catch), as well as a 90-day moratorium imposed on lobstering from early September to early December — as harmful and misguided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“From beginning to end, it seemed like they were always against us, to slow us down one way or another,” Carlo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They argued for years that the real culprit was toxicity from the pesticides, as well as an accumulation of other pollutants from decades of runoff into the Sound. They asked for money to “clean up” the Sound and more financial support for the struggling lobstermen. But their pleas fell on deaf ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frate and Carlo hold a litany of grudges against the Connecticut and New York politicians of that era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Schumer would never call us back … Blumenthal’s telling lies … Chris Shays, that piece of shit. You got your money. The state got their money. Now the fisheries’ money’s not there,” Frate said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frate and Carlo did eventually collect checks from the pesticide maker settlements. “But it wasn’t about the money,” Carlo said. “We’d give it all back to them if they could give us back Long Island Sound. We want our lobster back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A difficult adjustment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seara, the social scientist, understands the animosity towards the government in the years following the die-off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They were not being supported when they were going through something that was very impactful, very traumatic,” she said. “Some of the programs the government put in place were not well received. They didn’t seem to make sense to a lot of the fishermen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, there were some experiments with lobster trap buyback programs, which paid lobstermen to recover the thousands of abandoned pots littering the seafloor. In September, these programs received a $1.8 million boost of federal funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other programs included various job retraining efforts, which lobstermen like Mansi scoff at to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They said, ‘We’ll train you.’ Well, there’s no retraining. You don’t take a guy that’s been fishing on the water all his life and retrain him to go work in an office. It’s something that you can’t do,” Mansi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What made the prospect of retraining particularly unappealing is that, for so many lobstermen, lobstering is not just a job but a deeply held identity and beloved lifestyle. Seara, along with her mentor, Professor Richard Pollnac, have studied fishing communities across the world, and they’ve found that self-employed fishermen experience some of the highest levels of job satisfaction of any workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s the freedom, being out in the water, being close to nature, and some aspects that are thrilling. It’s a gamble, right? You’re out there, you don’t know what you’re going to get. Every day is different. You have encounters with nature, whales, and beautiful sunsets, and, on top of it, this adventure and this challenge, and this camaraderie,” Seara said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A fisherman once put it to me like this: ‘What other profession in the world do you know that people pay to do over the weekend?’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each lobsterman took their own path after the die-off. Some turned to clamming or catching conch, but most couldn’t find a way to support themselves on the water. Many struggled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We had a lot of guys who became alcoholics or drug addicts,” Mansi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We had to move on,” Mansi said. “I am still bitter about what happened, because not only did they wipe out an industry, they wiped out a way of life,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mansi turned his lobster pound on the docks in Guilford into a seasonal restaurant. He considers himself lucky, as he’s still able to work down by the water, and his son runs a fishing boat out of the same port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlo initially got a job doing manual labor down at the docks in Norwalk for $10 an hour, “just to do something and stay near the water,” but it didn’t pay the bills. He was forced to find a new career, so he started a landscaping business, which he still runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Landscaping, being on land … I hated it. Hated it. I hate it to this day,” Carlo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the few who seemed to transition smoothly was Whetmore. Immediately after the die-off, he got into marine construction, and he now runs a successful business out of Norwalk, G&amp;amp;C Marine, which primarily builds residential docks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whetmore was included in Seara’s 2019 study; notably, he was the sole lobsterman out of the 20 interviewed who said they believe that warming waters and the disease were to blame for the die-off. Even his own son insists it was the pesticides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can’t argue the numbers. You know, the bottom temperature, it’s there,” Whetmore said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He attributes his ability to adapt — and his acceptance of immovable forces like global warming — to a feeling that he is lucky to be alive. In the last two decades, he’s had two kidney transplants, cancer and multiple heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stonington’s working docks smell like diesel and bait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a sunny September afternoon, a flock of gulls circled the docks as the Lady Lynn cruised into the harbor — 42 feet of scuffed fiberglass, stacked with crusty lobster traps. The Lady Lynn is one of seven lobster boats still operating out of Stonington, the last commercial lobster fleet in Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roddy Grimshaw was on deck with his crew, Ian Crimm and Bubba Dolith, his 10-month-old puppy, Bailey, who ran back and forth excitedly, and his dad, Mike, who bought the Lady Lynn back in the ’70s. They were in a rush to haul out all their traps before Sept. 7, when the season closed for 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After unloading all the traps into massive stacks on the dock, Grimshaw took a breather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I’m on the boat, I’m always active, doing something like hauling lobsters, driving the boat, hauling the gear, seeing interesting things. I just, I love it, and I love to tan,” he said, laughing. Grimshaw showed off a new tattoo of a lobster on his very tan forearm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s been a good year,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grimshaw was averaging 160 lobsters (totaling about 200 pounds) each time he pulled traps. Though it’s a far cry from the quadruple digits his dad used to haul back in the ’90s, it’s an improvement from last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not a coincidence that the last remnants of the state’s lobster industry are located in Stonington. Just outside of Long Island Sound, only a few miles from the Rhode Island border, the area has somewhat cooler water, and its fishery wasn’t hit as hard by the die-off in the ’90s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, Grimshaw lobsters two to three days per week and the rest of the week goes out “dragging” for fish — flounder, whiting, sea bass and others. But lobstering is his true love, and he’d like to dedicate himself to it full-time, though he says the catch is just too variable to rely on. His eyes lit up when he considered the possibility. “It’s a big, big idea, and it would be so great,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of his other struggles is fetching a reasonable price for the lobsters he lands. Lobster imported from Maine and Canada for roughly $3 per pound dominate the market, which just isn’t enough to cover his costs. So he sells directly to the public on the docks in addition to selling to wholesalers who are willing to pay about $7 per pound, this year’s going rate for Connecticut lobsters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His crew members, Crimm, 18 and Dolith, 19, kidded around as they fixed up the engine and organized tools. They’re new to working with Grimshaw, who recently had to replace his entire crew after he discovered that one was drinking on the job, and the other was a registered sex offender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crimm and Dolith love the work, even though Grimshaw can give them a hard time. Neither of them has had what they’d consider a “normal” job — they’ve bounced between farming and other forms of manual labor — and they want to keep working on the Lady Lynn as long as there are lobster to be caught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not a normal 9-to-5, which I hate. I can’t do them,” Dolith said while pulling up lobster pots hanging off the side of the Lady Lynn in the harbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their boss, Grimshaw, plans to take over his dad’s lobstering license in January. At 29, as the youngest active commercial lobster captain in the state, he’ll represent both the next generation and the last of the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grimshaw understands the weight of his position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s not many other people here that does it, that wants to do it,” Grimshaw said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He pointed to a seafood restaurant and yacht club visible in the distance. “If this harbor wasn’t here, it wouldn’t make a difference to the tourists and out-of-town people. And I just don’t want to see that,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I want to continue,” he said. “I don’t see myself doing something different.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whetmore expressed a similar unease with the luxury development and tourism taking over the waterfront that used to be home to so many fishing and working docks. While walking around his construction yard in Norwalk one August afternoon, he pointed to the neighboring lots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There were oil tankers on this river. There were fishermen going down the river. Now it’s condos and rowing clubs. It’s definitely changing. It’s been very gentrified.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Norwalk Planning &amp;amp; Zoning Commission just approved a 59-unit mixed-use complex, with luxury apartments and a boardwalk, on the property adjacent to Whetmore’s construction yard. He said the town government has applied enormous pressure on him to move his business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In town after town along the Sound, the working waterfront is giving way to luxury housing and recreation. A 2022 mid-Atlantic fisheries briefing flagged “persistent trends toward gentrification of working waterfronts,” noting that the loss of maritime space can upend the cultural identity of fishing communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They don’t want equipment like this. They need us when we build their docks, their yacht clubs, their rowing clubs, and they love us when we’re building them, but they don’t want to see us,” Whetmore said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was a community, a waterfront community, and that’s gone,” he said. “That way of life is gone.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3bwy8004x26p33s686c16@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Big Cities Health Coalition is the latest group to take a strong public stand in support of vaccination as a direct response to concerns that the federal government is limiting access and raising doubts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h00043b6nbu1oeq9v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are united behind a simple message: get vaccinated,” the group wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.bigcitieshealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VaxMemberStatement.October2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; that was published Monday. It was signed by two dozen public health leaders from some of the nation’s largest cities, in both Democrat- and Republican-led states.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h00053b6nl9ia75m4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccination has saved millions of lives, they wrote, but falling vaccination rates across the country have led to more frequent outbreaks of devastating diseases such as measles and polio. They also referenced the “rapidly approaching” respiratory virus season, which brings a heavy wave of Covid-19 and flu infections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h00063b6n692ikxoo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are deeply troubled by the repeated false claims about vaccines from too many federal officials, which have contributed directly to these trends,” the public health leaders wrote. “We are equally concerned about recent changes to the recommended childhood and adult immunization schedules that unnecessarily limit access to vaccines.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h00073b6nf1v8b1x9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/18/health/cdc-vaccine-panel-acip-mmrv-hepatitis"&gt;voted&lt;/a&gt; last month to recommend against the combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) vaccine for children younger than 4, and a new working group will convene to more broadly assess the safety, effectiveness and timing of the shots children and adolescents get, as well as whether &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/health/cdc-acip-vaccine-working-group"&gt;the schedule should be changed&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h00083b6nws1wzadu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And at a recent Cabinet meeting, President Donald Trump made &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/politics/fact-check-trump-cabinet-meeting"&gt;numerous false claims&lt;/a&gt; about vaccines given to children, including about the size of vaccine doses and that babies get 82 vaccines in a single shot.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h00093b6ni88031zx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As vaccination becomes increasingly politicized, city health officials say, they felt a need to speak up to protect their communities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h000a3b6nkcrasbhy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have to make our public health decisions based on data and not on political ideology,” said Dr. Phil Huang, director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department. “We have to be the voices for that science and reason.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h000b3b6nz8gc5wnq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Multiple major medical organizations – including the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/health/covid-vaccine-recommendation-aap"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/22/health/covid-vaccine-pregnancy-acog-recommendations"&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt; – have broken from the CDC on vaccine guidance. And new &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/03/health/west-coast-states-health-guidance"&gt;public health organizations have formed&lt;/a&gt; in recent months with an aim to safeguard public health amid turmoil at the federal level.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h000c3b6nei209twu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Big Cities Health Coalition, with members representing about a fifth of the US population, has been working together to exchange ideas and address public health threats for more than two decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h000d3b6ntp7e7jrx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the “threats are growing and becoming more complicated,” said Dr. Raynard Washington, director of public health for Mecklenburg County, North Carolina – including from the federal government.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h000e3b6nbyrgn33k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s a lot of conversation happening about how, in the absence of a strong federal public health system, we are able to navigate and ensure that we continue to protect public safety,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h000f3b6nc0d3srv7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Consistency is important in public health, and the federal structure helped facilitate that, he said. But in the absence of that, coordination becomes key.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h000g3b6neg1xv8cc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A measles outbreak is growing quickly in the upstate region of South Carolina, just about 100 miles from Charlotte.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h000h3b6n4uaazu5o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I don’t have any walls to put up to keep folks from Mecklenburg going into South Carolina, or people from South Carolina going into Mecklenburg County,” Washington said. “So as a country, our local public health system is only as strong as the weakest county or jurisdiction. There is an importance of ensuring that we work collaboratively, because the boundaries that we actually exist in are only administrative.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h000i3b6nddo8hb7b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than 100 unvaccinated students in South Carolina are in quarantine because of a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/health/measles-outbreaks-utah-arizona-south-carolina"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; exposure in school – one of the many reasons why Big Cities Health Coalition emphasizes the importance of vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h000j3b6n5jwp5t09@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccines “keep classrooms safe and schools open. They allow children to spend time with friends and enjoy their favorite activities. They help parents and caregivers work to support their families,” the organizations wrote in the new letter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h000k3b6n2x7kd6j3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Trust also plays a key role in public health, experts say, and city health leaders want to provide reassurance to their communities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h000l3b6ndhg188u9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “CDC has been the pinnacle of our public health science up until now. Now it seems more driven by political ideology than actual data and science, so it undermines the trust,” Huang said. “We’re all having to band together and provide that credible data- and science-driven messaging.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h000m3b6nognbjc47@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A recent &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/health/rfk-approval-cdc-trust-vaccines-kff"&gt;KFF poll&lt;/a&gt; found that public trust in the CDC is the lowest it’s been since the Covid-19 pandemic began. Only half of adults in the US say they trust the agency to provide reliable vaccine information, down from 57% in July and 63% in September 2024.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgy3cb4h000n3b6ntx0ezq96@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Despite all the chaos and mixed messages, we remain steadfast in our commitment to the health of our communities and making sure the message is clear on the importance of vaccination,” Huang said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

                Collagen is the most abundant protein in our bodies. It helps keep our skin firm and elastic. But as we age, the amount and quality of that collagen declines. And some people turn to supplements.

&lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;The explorer Ponce de Leon famously went to Florida in search of the fountain of youth. But if you listen to social media influencers, he should probably have headed to the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/04/nx-s1-5526053/are-creatine-supplements-all-that-theyre-pumped-up-to-be" target="_blank"&gt;supplement aisle &lt;/a&gt;to pick up some collagen.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm in my 40s and if I shave, I look like I'm in my mid-20s," a Tiktok creator who goes by Shop By Jake claims &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shopbyjake/video/7423801980809760043?q=collagen&amp;amp;t=1760564499655" target="_blank"&gt; in one paid promotion&lt;/a&gt;. "People ask me all the time, what do you do for your skin? I take collagen," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Claims about the health and beauty benefits of collagen supplements are commonplace these days, especially online. But does the evidence back the hype?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The claim&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Collagen supplements can promote healthier skin, hair and nails, and stronger joints.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The theory&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Collagen is the most &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/23089-collagen" target="_blank"&gt;abundant protein in the body&lt;/a&gt;. It's found in skin, hair, nails, tendons, ligaments, cartilage and bones. It helps maintain our skin's elasticity and volume. It's a structural protein, so it gives strength and integrity to our tissues and keeps joints strong, among other things. But starting in our 20s, the amount and quality of the collagen our bodies produce declines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Factors lik&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/06/17/nx-s1-5002030/sunscreen-tiktok-misinformation-melanoma" target="_blank"&gt;e UV radiation, &lt;/a&gt;smoking and exposure to&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/18/nx-s1-5436960/maha-rfk-toxic-chemicals-trump-hhs-epa" target="_blank"&gt; environmental pollutants &lt;/a&gt;can speed up that decline. But it's going to happen with age regardless, which is why lots of people turn to collagen supplements.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Collagen supplements generally come in two main forms.&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8944283/" target="_blank"&gt; Hydrolyzed collagen peptides&lt;/a&gt; are basically collagen that's been broken down into smaller chains of amino acids to make them easier to absorb. They're derived from animal sources, such as fish, cattle, pigs or chicken. That's typically what's used in supplements aimed at improving skin and hair, as well as joint health.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The theory is that if you ingest [a collagen supplement,] it goes through the GI tract and gets absorbed and then it theoretically goes to places to support or increase collagen production," says &lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/doctors/1720366636/lauren-taglia-md-phd" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Lauren Taglia&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified dermatologist with Northwestern Medicine in Naperville, Ill.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The second main form of supplement is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10058045/#:~:text=Native%20type%20II%20collagen%20has,tissues%20and%20exert%20chondroprotective%20effects." target="_blank"&gt;undenatured, or native, type II collagen&lt;/a&gt;, which hasn't been broken down. It's derived from chickens. Most of the collagen found in cartilage is type II. These kinds of supplements are thought to promote joint health by triggering the immune system to produce chemical messengers that tamp down inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So what does the research say?&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The evidence&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Let's start with skin.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When it comes to skin health, there are studies that suggest collagen supplements work.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There have been randomized controlled trials that have shown that after 8 to 12 weeks of collagen supplementation, things like depth of wrinkles, skin elasticity, dermal thickness seem to be improved," says&lt;a href="https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/10176" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Maryanne Makredes Senna&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of dermatology at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33742704/" target="_blank"&gt;meta-analysis of 19 studies published in 2021&lt;/a&gt; found that, compared with a placebo, people taking collagen supplements had better skin hydration, elasticity and improvements in wrinkles.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40324552/" target="_blank"&gt;second meta-analysis &lt;/a&gt;was published this year. It looked at 23 randomized controlled trials with more than 1,400 patients who took collagen supplements for skin issues, and it also found significant improvements in those same areas after 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Senna says those findings came with a big caveat: The studies that found the biggest improvements were lower-quality and were funded by the supplement industry, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"High-quality studies and studies not funded by industry did not show a significant association rate," Senna says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Given that, the state of the evidence when it comes to collagen supplements for skin is mixed at best, says dermatologist Lauren Taglia. "As physician-scientists, we would love to see studies done on a large scale and done independently," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;It's a similar story when it comes to collagen supplements for joint health. Studies have shown benefits — such as in &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/52/3/167" target="_blank"&gt;reducing pain from osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But again, much of the research is industry funded, so it can be hard to disentangle potential bias, says &lt;a href="https://www.bumc.bu.edu/camed/profile/david-felson/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. David Felson&lt;/a&gt;, an osteoarthritis researcher and professor at Boston University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1756-185X.14382" target="_blank"&gt;systematic review &lt;/a&gt;found that most of the studies of collagen supplements for rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis were too low quality to determine whether they really helped. Some studies included in that review reported adverse effects, such as an exacerbation of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"With respect to collagen, I don't know what the right answer is," Felson says. It could potentially help, but "there are no large scale studies here and there need to be," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If it's healthier skin you're after, collagen supplements "could be helpful, but there's not a ton of strong evidence to support them at this point," Taglia says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Your best bet is to focus on things that do have robust evidence behind them, says &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/maya-jonas-md-121877" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Maya Jonas&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of dermatology at the Ohio State University. That includes&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/06/04/1179542293/picking-the-right-sunscreen-isnt-as-important-as-avoiding-these-6-mistakes" target="_blank"&gt; wearing sunscreen and other sun protection&lt;/a&gt; and using &lt;a href="https://health.osu.edu/health/skin-and-body/what-retinoids-can-do-for-skin" target="_blank"&gt;vitamin A-based products like retinol&lt;/a&gt;, which have been clinically proven to stimulate collagen production. Keeping your skin moisturized is also important.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lifestyle factors matter too, Jonas says. She recommends a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, which provide antioxidants like vitamin C, and nuts and seeds, which are good sources of zinc and copper and help support collagen production.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We always talk about diet, making sure patients are eating a healthy Mediterranean diet that's well-balanced, avoiding alcohol, not smoking and avoiding secondhand smoke," Jonas says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10979338/" target="_blank"&gt;get plenty of sleep and exercise&lt;/a&gt;, adds Senna. Poor sleep and stress can &lt;a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jnsv/63/1/63_15/_article" target="_blank"&gt;take a toll on skin&lt;/a&gt;, while exercise can improve blood flow to the skin and may &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-37207-9" target="_blank"&gt;help counteract the loss of elasticity and dermal thickness&lt;/a&gt; that comes with aging.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's not just good for skin, but overall health, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0"&gt;Three women become choked up as they deliver news in a video posted to social media. “We did it, everybody,” says Leslie Manookian, the woman in the middle. She is a driving force in a campaign that has chipped away at the foundations of modern public health in Idaho. The group had just gotten lawmakers to pass what she called the first true “medical freedom” bill in the nation. “It’s literally landmark,” Manookian said. “It is changing everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0"&gt;With Manookian in &lt;a href="https://rumble.com/v6ro3bt-idahos-health-freedom-act-becomes-law.html"&gt;the video&lt;/a&gt; are two of her allies, the leaders of Health Freedom Idaho. It was April 4, hours after the governor signed the &lt;a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/title73/t73ch5/"&gt;Idaho Medical Freedom Act&lt;/a&gt; into law.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0"&gt;The act makes it illegal for state and local governments, private businesses, employers, schools and daycares to require anyone to take a vaccine or receive any other “medical intervention.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.1"&gt;Whether the law will actually alter day-to-day life in Idaho is an open question, because Idaho already made it easy to get around the few existing vaccination requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0"&gt;But it could have a significant effect in other states, where rules aren’t already so relaxed. And it comes at a time when diseases once eradicated from the U.S. through vaccination are making a resurgence.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0"&gt;The law runs against one of the hallmarks of modern public health: that a person’s full participation in society depends on their willingness to follow certain rules. (Want to send your child to public school? They’ll need a measles vaccine. Want to work in a retirement community during flu season? You might have to wear a mask.)&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0"&gt;The new Idaho law flips that on its head. It not only removes the obligation to follow such rules, it makes the rules themselves illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.0"&gt;The new law sets Idaho apart from even conservative-leaning South Carolina, where &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/unvaccinated-students-quarantining-measles-south-carolina/"&gt;two schools recently&lt;/a&gt; quarantined more than 150 unvaccinated children after measles arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0"&gt;A person &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/communication-resources/clinical-diagnosis-fact-sheet.html#:~:text=Disease%20course,4%20days%20after%20rash%20onset"&gt;can spread measles&lt;/a&gt; for four days before symptoms appear. During the South Carolina schools’ quarantine, five students began to show symptoms, but the quarantine kept them from spreading it, &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/tuesday-measles-update-dph-increases-measles-case-count-16-total-2025-12-related-upstate"&gt;the health department said this month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0"&gt;That precaution would now be illegal in Idaho.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0"&gt;Idaho’s law caught the attention of people who share Manookian’s belief that — contrary to &lt;a href="https://historyofvaccines.org/vaccines-101"&gt;hundreds of years of public health evidence and rigorous regulation in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; — vaccines are worse than the diseases they prevent.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0"&gt;It also caught the attention of people like Jennifer Herricks, a pro-vaccine advocate in Louisiana and &lt;a href="https://www.familiesforvaccines.org/staff-bios/#jenniferherricks"&gt;advocacy director for American Families for Vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0"&gt;Herricks and her counterparts in other states say that vaccine requirements have “done so much good for our kids and for our communities.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="18.0"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7331a2.htm"&gt;analysis published last year by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; found that routine childhood vaccines prevented more than 1.1 million deaths and 32 million hospitalizations in the U.S. over three decades, saving $540 billion in direct costs and saving society about $2.7 trillion. The analysis was limited; it didn’t account for the lives and money saved by vaccines for flu or RSV, which kill and hospitalize babies and children each year.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0"&gt;Idaho’s move was “pretty concerning,” Herricks said, “especially seeing the direction that everything is headed at the federal government.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.1"&gt;The law is the culmination of a decade of anti-vaccine activism that got a boost from the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0"&gt;It’s rooted in a belief system that distrusts institutions — government health agencies, vaccine makers, medical societies and others — on the premise that those institutions seek only money and control.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0"&gt;Manookian said in an interview that she believes one person should never be told to risk their health in “the theoretical” service of another. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.1"&gt;Now, Manookian and her allies have a new goal in their sights: to make Idaho’s legislation a nationwide standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0"&gt;Idaho was already more permissive than other states when it came to vaccine rules. Parents since at least the 1990s could send unvaccinated children to school if they signed a form saying vaccination went against their religious or personal beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0"&gt;That wasn’t good enough for Idahoans who describe themselves as advocates for health freedom. They worked to shift the paradigm, bit by bit, so that it can be easier now for parents to get a vaccine exemption than to show the school their child is actually vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.0"&gt;In recent years, lawmakers ordered schools and daycare centers to tell parents about &lt;a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/Title39/T39CH48/SECT39-4801/"&gt;the exemptions allowed in Idaho&lt;/a&gt; whenever they communicate about immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0"&gt;The state also decided to let parents exempt their kids by writing a note, instead of having to fill out a form — one that, in the past, required them to acknowledge the risks of going unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0"&gt;(There is conflicting data on whether these changes truly affected vaccination rates or just led more parents to skip the trouble of handing in vaccine records. Starting in 2021, Idaho schools reported a steady drop in the share of kindergartners with documented vaccinations. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/childvaxview/about/interactive-reports.html"&gt;Phone surveys&lt;/a&gt; of parents, by contrast, showed vaccination rates have been largely unchanged.)&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0"&gt;An enduring backlash against Idaho’s short-lived COVID-19 mandates gave Manookian’s movement more momentum, culminating this year in what she considered the ultimate step in Idaho’s evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.1"&gt;Manookian had a previous career in finance in New York and London. She transitioned to work as a homeopath and advocate, ultimately returning to her home state of Idaho.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0"&gt;The bill she came up with said that almost nobody can be required to have a vaccine or take any test or medical procedure or treatment in order to go to school, get a job or go about life how they’d like to. In practice, that would mean schools couldn’t send unvaccinated kids home, even during a measles outbreak, and private businesses and daycares couldn’t require people on their property to follow public health guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0"&gt;The state had just passed “the Coronavirus Stop Act” in 2023, which banned nearly all COVID-19 vaccine requirements. If lawmakers did that for COVID-19, Manookian reasoned, they could do the same for all communicable diseases and all medical decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
    
    
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.0"&gt;Her theory was right, ultimately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.1"&gt;The bill she penned in the summer of 2024 made it through the Republican-controlled House and Senate in early 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.2"&gt;Manookian took to social media to rally support for the legislation as it sat on the desk of Gov. Brad Little.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0"&gt;But the governor vetoed it. &lt;a href="https://gov.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/veto_s-1023aaaa_2025.pdf"&gt;In a letter&lt;/a&gt;, he explained that he saw the bill as government intrusion on “parents’ freedom to ensure their children stay healthy.” During an outbreak, he said, schools wouldn’t be able to send home students “with highly contagious conditions” like measles.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0"&gt;Manookian tried again days after the veto. In the next version of the bill, protections during a disease outbreak applied only to “healthy” people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.1"&gt;This time, Little signed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0"&gt;Weeks after the signing, Manookian joined like-minded advocates on a stage in Washington, D.C., for a launch event for the MAHA Institute, a group with strong ties to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (MAHA stands for Make America Healthy Again.) The new Health and Human Services secretary had denounced vaccines for years before President Donald Trump appointed him.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="36.0"&gt;At the gathering, Manookian announced her next mission: to make it “a societal norm and to codify it in law” that nobody can dictate any other person’s medical choices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="36.1"&gt;“We’re going to roll that out to other states, and we’re going to make America free again,” Manookian &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/fONtd73sNJg?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=81"&gt;told the audience&lt;/a&gt; in May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="36.2"&gt;Manookian’s commitment to bring along the rest of the country has continued ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0"&gt;Her nonprofit, the Health Freedom Defense Fund, is now distributing &lt;a href="https://healthfreedomdefense.org/resources/"&gt;model legislation and a how-to guide&lt;/a&gt;, with talking points to persuade legislators. Manookian said in podcast interviews that she is working with the nonprofit &lt;a href="https://standforhealthfreedom.com/about-us/"&gt;Stand For Health Freedom&lt;/a&gt; to mobilize activists in every state.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="40.0"&gt;In an interview with ProPublica, Manookian said her objective is for people to “understand and appreciate that the most basic and fundamental of human rights is the right to direct our own medical treatment — and to codify that in law in every state. Breaking that barrier in Idaho proves that it can be done, that Americans understand the importance of this, and the humanity of it, and that it should be done in other states.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0"&gt;Her efforts were rewarded over the summer with a visit from none other than Kennedy, who visited Boise and toured a farm &lt;a href="https://x.com/LeslieManookian/status/1950684276510629904"&gt;with Manookian and state lawmakers in tow.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="42.0"&gt;“This state, more than any other state in the country” aligns with the MAHA campaign, Kennedy told reporters at a news conference where no one was allowed to ask questions. Kennedy called Idaho “the home of medical freedom.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="44.0"&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to ProPublica’s request for comment from Kennedy or his staff on Idaho’s law and his visit to the state. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="44.1"&gt;Children’s Health Defense, the organization Kennedy built into one of the fiercest foes of childhood vaccines, took interest in the Idaho bill early on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="44.2"&gt;The group promoted the bill as it sat on the governor’s desk, as he vetoed it, then as Manookian worked successfully to get a revived bill through the statehouse and signed into law.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="45.0"&gt;The organization’s online video programming featured Manookian five times in late March and early April. One show’s host told viewers they could follow Idaho in its “very smart strategy” of taking a law against COVID-related mandates, “crossing out ‘COVID,’ making a few other tweaks, and you have an incredible health freedom bill after that.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="46.0"&gt;Children’s Health Defense CEO &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/authors/mary-holland-j-d/"&gt;Mary Holland&lt;/a&gt; said she’s known Manookian for more than 15 years and pushed the national organization to publicize Manookian’s work. Holland introduced her at the Washington, D.C., event.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.0"&gt;Whereas most states put the onus on unvaccinated people to show why they should opt out of a mandate, Idaho’s legislation made unvaccinated people the norm — shifting the burden of accommodation onto those who support vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="48.0"&gt;Now, parents of infants too young for a measles vaccine can’t choose a daycare that requires immunization. Parents of immune-compromised students must decide whether to keep their children home from school during an outbreak of vaccine-preventable diseases, knowing unvaccinated children won’t be quarantined.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="49.0"&gt;Holland said Idaho parents who want their kids to be in a learning environment with “herd immunity” levels of measles vaccination can start a private “association” — not a school, because schools can’t require vaccines — just as parents who don’t like vaccines have done in order to dodge requirements imposed by states like California and New York.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="50.0"&gt;“I think you could certainly do that in Idaho.” Holland said. “It wouldn’t be a public school. It might be the Church of Vaccinia school.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="53.0"&gt;The day Idaho’s Medical Freedom Act was signed, a legislator in Louisiana brought forward &lt;a href="https://www.legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?s=25rs&amp;amp;b=HB555&amp;amp;sbi=y"&gt;the Louisiana Medical Freedom Act&lt;/a&gt;. In a hearing later, she pointed to Idaho as a model.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="54.0"&gt;Louisiana followed Idaho once before in 2024, when it &lt;a href="https://legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?i=245567"&gt;passed a law&lt;/a&gt; that requires schools to describe the exemptions available to parents whenever they communicate about immunizations. Idaho had passed an almost identical law three years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="55.0"&gt;Herricks, the Louisiana pro-vaccine advocate, said she watched the Idaho Medical Freedom Act’s progress with “a lot of concern, seeing how much progress it was making.” Now it’s set a precedent, Herricks said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.0"&gt;Holland, the Children’s Health Defense CEO, said she looks forward to Idaho’s approach spreading.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="58.0"&gt;She pointed to a September announcement by Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo that he intends to rid his state of all vaccine mandates. Holland said she expects other Republican-controlled states to take a serious look at the Idaho law. (Ladapo’s office did not respond to requests for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="59.0"&gt;“It’s a big change,” Holland said. “It’s not just related to vaccines. It’s a blow against the notion that there can be compulsory medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.0"&gt;Some people support the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/history-disease-outbreaks-vaccine-timeline/requirements-research"&gt;more-than-century-old notion&lt;/a&gt; that compelling people to be vaccinated or masked will provide such enormous collective benefits that it outweighs any inconvenience or small incursion on personal liberty.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="61.0"&gt;Others, like Holland and Manookian, do not.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="62.0"&gt;At the heart of laws like Idaho’s is a sense of, “‘I’m going to do what I want to do for myself, and I don’t want anybody telling me what to do,’ which is in direct contrast to public health,” said Paul Offit, pediatrician and vaccinologist at the University of Pennsylvania and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="63.0"&gt;Offit, who co-invented a vaccine against rotavirus, is a critic of Kennedy and was removed from a federal vaccine panel in September.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="64.0"&gt;A more fundamental conflict is that some people believe vaccines and other tools to prevent the spread of illness, like masks, are harmful. That belief is at odds with the overwhelming consensus of scientists and health experts, including Kennedy’s own &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251015193709/https://www.hhs.gov/immunization/basics/safety/index.html"&gt;Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251012054453/https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/masks.html"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="65.0"&gt;Both tensions are at play in Idaho.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="67.0"&gt;As is the case nationally, Idaho’s “health freedom” movement has long pushed back against being labeled “anti-vaccine.” Idaho lawmakers and advocates have stressed that their goals are bodily autonomy and informed choice.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="68.0"&gt;They do not take a stance on the bodily autonomy principle when it comes to abortion, however. Almost all state legislators who voted for the Idaho Medical Freedom Act also voted to ban abortion, if they were in office at both times.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="70.0"&gt;“Every action has to be evaluated on its individual morality,” not on whether it does the most good for the most people, Manookian said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="70.1"&gt;But Manookian’s rejection of vaccine mandates goes beyond a libertarian philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="71.0"&gt;Manookian has said publicly that she thinks vaccines are “poison for profit,” that continuing to let daycares require vaccination would “put our children on the chopping block,” that measles is “positive for the body,” that the virus protects against cancer, and that it can send people “into total remission" — an assertion she made on an Idaho wellness center’s podcast in April.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="72.0"&gt;Manookian told ProPublica she believes infectious diseases have been made “the bogeyman.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="73.0"&gt;Against those claims, research has shown that having the measles &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/inside-immune-amnesia"&gt;suppresses immunity to other diseases&lt;/a&gt;, a phenomenon dubbed &lt;a href="https://asm.org/articles/2019/may/measles-and-immune-amnesia"&gt;“immune amnesia”&lt;/a&gt; that can make children who have recovered from measles &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaa3662"&gt;more susceptible to pneumonia and other bacterial and viral infections&lt;/a&gt;. About 20% of unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized, and 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children who are infected will die from complications of the disease, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="74.0"&gt;And while researchers have studied using engineered measles viruses in a cancer treatment, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025619619304628"&gt;those same researchers have written that&lt;/a&gt; they were “dismayed to learn” their research has been misconstrued by some who oppose vaccination. They said they “very strongly advise” giving children the measles vaccine, that there “is no evidence that measles infection can protect against cancer” and that measles is “a dangerous pathogen, not suitable for use as a cancer therapy.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="75.0"&gt;(Manookian said she believes she has evidence for her cancer remission claim but couldn’t readily produce it, adding that she may have been mistaken.)&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="76.0"&gt;The measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, meanwhile, is safe and highly effective, according to &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-the-measles-vaccine-is-safe-and-effective/"&gt;the American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/ID-topics/infectious-disease/measles/know-the-facts"&gt;the Infectious Diseases Society of America&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html"&gt;the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, among others. The CDC says the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html"&gt;most common negative reactions&lt;/a&gt; are a sore arm, fever or mild rash. Two doses of the vaccine provide near total protection, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="78.0"&gt;Manookian said she doesn’t believe the research on vaccines has been adequate.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="79.0"&gt;She will have another chance to spread her views from a prominent platform in November, when she’s scheduled to speak at the &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/chd-2025-conference/agenda/"&gt;Children’s Health Defense 2025 conference&lt;/a&gt; in Austin, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="80.0"&gt;She’ll share the stage with celebrities in the anti-vaccine movement: Del Bigtree, communications director for Kennedy’s past presidential campaign; actor Russell Brand; Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson; and Ladapo, the Florida surgeon general who made headlines for his push to end vaccine mandates in Florida, months after Idaho wrote that concept into law.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A decade after a landmark study proved that feeding peanut products to young babies could prevent development of life-threatening allergies, new research finds the change has made a big difference in the real world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 60,000 children have avoided developing peanut allergies after guidance first issued in 2015 upended medical practice by recommending introducing the allergen to infants starting as early as 4 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's a remarkable thing, right?" said Dr. David Hill, an allergist and researcher at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and author of a study published Monday in the medical journal Pediatrics. Hill and colleagues analyzed electronic health records from dozens of pediatric practices to track diagnoses of food allergies in young children before, during and after the guidelines were issued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can actually come to you today and say there are less kids with food allergy today than there would have been if we hadn't implemented this public health effort," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings have relevance from those of us who treat patients to those caring for infants, and more awareness, education and advocacy could further increase the positive results we observed in this study," he continued. "Future studies could potentially explore specific feeding practices that help us better understand the timing, frequency and dose of foods that optimize protection against food allergies."&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that peanut allergies in children ages 0 to 3 declined by more than 27% after guidance for high-risk kids was first issued in 2015 and by more than 40% after the recommendations were expanded in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effort hasn't yet reduced an overall increase in food allergies in the U.S. in recent years. About 8% of children are affected, including more than 2% with a peanut allergy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peanut allergy is caused when the body's immune system mistakenly identifies proteins in peanuts as harmful and releases chemicals that trigger allergic symptoms, including hives, respiratory symptoms and, sometimes, life-threatening anaphylaxis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, doctors had recommended delaying feeding children peanuts and other foods likely to trigger allergies until age 3. But in 2015, Gideon Lack at King's College London published the groundbreaking Learning Early About Peanut Allergy, or LEAP, trial.  &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lack and colleagues showed that introducing peanut products in infancy reduced the future risk of developing food allergies by more than 80%. Later analysis showed that the protection persisted in about 70% of kids into adolescence.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study immediately sparked new guidelines urging early introduction of peanuts — but putting them into practice has been slow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only about 29% of pediatricians and 65% of allergists reported following the expanded guidance issued in 2017, surveys found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confusion and uncertainty about the best way to introduce peanuts early in life led to the lag, according to a commentary that accompanied the study. Early on, medical experts and parents alike questioned whether the practice could be adopted outside of tightly controlled clinical settings.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data for the analysis came from a subset of participating practice sites and may not represent the entire U.S. pediatric population, noted the commentary, led by Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a child allergy expert at Northwestern University.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the new research offers "promising evidence that early allergen introduction is not only being adopted but may be making a measurable impact," the authors concluded.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocates for the 33 million people in the U.S. with food allergies welcomed signs that early introduction of peanut products is catching on. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This research reinforces what we already know and underscores a meaningful opportunity to reduce the incidence and prevalence of peanut allergy nationwide," said Sung Poblete, chief executive of the nonprofit group Food Allergy Research &amp;amp; Education, or FARE.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study emphasizes the current guidance, updated in 2021, which calls for introducing peanuts and other major food allergens between four and six months, without prior screening or testing, Hill said. Parents should consult their pediatricians about any questions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It doesn't have to be a lot of the food, but little tastes of peanut butter, milk-based yogurt, soy-based yogurts and tree butters," he said. "These are really good ways to allow the immune system exposure to these allergenic foods in a safe way." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiffany Leon, 36, a Maryland registered dietician and director at FARE, introduced peanuts and other allergens early to her own sons, James, 4, and Cameron, 2. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, Leon's own mother was shocked at the advice to feed babies such foods before the age of 3, she said. But Leon explained how the science had changed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a dietician, I practice evidence-based recommendations," she said. "So when someone told me, 'This is how it's done now, these are the new guidelines,' I just thought, 'OK, well, this is what we're going to do.'"&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;

Researchers found that these forms of exercise were the most effective for easing pain, improving movement, and enhancing overall quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although other exercise types can provide added benefits, the researchers emphasized that aerobic activity should remain the foundation of treatment. Osteoarthritis develops when the cartilage cushioning the ends of bones wears down, leading to swelling, stiffness, and discomfort. It can affect any joint, but the knees are most commonly impacted. About 30% of adults over age 45 show signs of knee osteoarthritis on x-rays, and roughly half of them experience significant pain and mobility problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filling the Evidence Gap in Exercise Guidance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise is a cornerstone of osteoarthritis care, yet many medical guidelines lack clear direction on which kinds are most beneficial for knee osteoarthritis specifically. To clarify this, researchers analyzed the effectiveness and safety of several exercise approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their comprehensive analysis drew on 217 randomized clinical trials conducted between 1990 and 2024. In total, the research included 15,684 participants and compared multiple exercise categories -- including aerobic, flexibility, strengthening, mind-body, neuromotor, and mixed programs -- against control groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluating Pain Relief, Function, and Mobility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trials varied in quality, but the team assessed the strength of the evidence using the internationally recognized GRADE system. They examined several key outcomes: pain reduction, physical function, gait performance, and quality of life. Each was measured at short term (four weeks), mid-term (12 weeks), and long term (24 weeks) follow-ups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across these studies, aerobic exercise consistently ranked highest in improving outcomes among all exercise types tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aerobic Activity Delivers the Broadest Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moderate-certainty evidence showed that, compared with control groups, aerobic exercise effectively reduced short- and mid-term pain and improved function in both the short and long term. It also enhanced gait performance and quality of life over short and mid-term periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other exercise forms showed value too. Mind-body workouts likely provided a notable improvement in short-term function, neuromotor exercises likely boosted short-term gait performance, and strengthening or mixed routines improved function in the mid-term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safe and Effective for Long-Term Use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, none of the exercise types resulted in more adverse events than the control groups, indicating that these therapies are generally safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors did acknowledge some study limitations. Many results came from indirect comparisons, certain outcomes lacked long-term data, and smaller studies may have influenced some early findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clear Takeaway for Patients and Clinicians&lt;/strong&gt;Despite these limitations, the researchers describe their work as one of the most complete and current evaluations of exercise for managing knee osteoarthritis. They believe the findings will help clinicians make more targeted recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the evidence, the team advises aerobic exercise "as a first line intervention for knee osteoarthritis management, particularly when the aim is to improve functional capacity and reduce pain" and say if aerobic exercise is not possible owing to individual limitations, "alternative forms of structured physical activity may still be beneficial."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Trachoma, a neglected tropical disease (NTD) and the world’s leading infectious cause of blindness, no longer poses a public health threat in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trachoma is the first NTD to be eliminated in Fiji. Fiji is the 26th country to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem and the 58th country globally to eliminate at least one NTD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“WHO congratulates Fiji and its network of global and local partners on reaching this milestone,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Future generations of Fijians have been given a precious gift in being set free from the suffering that trachoma has inflicted on their ancestors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trachoma is caused by the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/em&gt; and spreads through personal contact, interactions with contaminated surfaces and on flies that have been in contact with eye or nose discharge of an infected person. Repeated infections can lead to scarring, in-turning of the eyelids, and ultimately blindness. Globally, the disease remains endemic in many vulnerable communities where access to clean water and sanitation is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fiji’s success story&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fiji’s success in eliminating trachoma is a beacon of what’s possible when communities, governments, and partners unite behind a shared goal”, said Dr Saia Ma’u Piukala, WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific.  “This is a celebration of the power of Pacific leadership and the impact of sustained investment in health. WHO congratulates Fiji and is committed to supporting countries across the Region in advancing health for all so that no one is left behind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trachoma was once a significant public health problem in Fiji, with medical reports from the 1930s and community-based surveys in the 1950s documenting widespread disease and risk of blindness. By the 1980s, the condition had declined markedly, with cataract and refractive error emerging as the main causes of vision loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concern however was renewed in the 2000s, when rapid assessments suggested high levels of active trachoma in children, prompting the Ministry of Health and Medical Services to launch a comprehensive programme to better understand the situation and take necessary action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2012, Fiji has undertaken a series of robust, internationally supported surveys and studies, including population-based prevalence surveys and laboratory testing, to understand the local epidemiology of trachoma and distinguish it from other causes of eye disease. This sustained effort, integrated with school health, water and sanitation initiatives, and community awareness programmes, has confirmed that trachoma is no longer a public health problem in Fiji and that systems are in place to identify and manage future cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Fiji’s elimination of trachoma is a defining moment for health equity in the Pacific,” said Honourable Dr Ratu Atonio Rabici Lalabalavu, Minister of Health and Medical Services of Fiji.  “This achievement reflects years of coordinated action – across villages, health facilities and regional platforms – demonstrating unwavering commitment of our health- care workers, communities leading the change. As we celebrate this milestone, we call on our donors and partners in the Pacific and beyond to continue supporting accelerated action of neglected tropical diseases to address other diseases not only in Fiji, but across the Pacific”.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Contribution to global progress&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of diseases and conditions associated with devastating health, social and economic consequences. They are mainly prevalent mostly among impoverished communities in tropical areas. WHO estimates that NTDs affect more than 1 billion people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The targets included in the  &lt;a href="/publications/i/item/9789240010352"&gt;Road map for neglected tropical diseases 2021–2030&lt;/a&gt; cover the prevention, control, elimination and eradication of 20 diseases and disease groups by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2016, 13 Member States in the Western Pacific Region, which covers 38 countries and areas, have been validated by WHO for eliminating at least one NTD. Of these, six (Cambodia, China, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and Viet Nam) have successfully eliminated trachoma as a public health problem. Trachoma elimination is part of broader progress on NTDs in Fiji and the rest of the Western Pacific Region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO continues to support countries in their efforts to eliminate trachoma and other NTDs, ensuring healthier lives for all, particularly the most disadvantaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;A decade after a landmark study proved that feeding peanut products to young babies could &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLhHL8pjYRc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;prevent development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of life-threatening allergies, new research finds the change has made a big difference in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 60,000 children have avoided developing peanut allergies after guidance first issued in 2015 upended medical practice by recommending introducing the allergen to infants starting as early as 4 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s a remarkable thing, right?” said Dr. David Hill, an allergist and researcher at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and author of a study &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/online-first?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published Monday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the medical journal Pediatrics. Hill and colleagues analyzed electronic health records from dozens of pediatric practices to track diagnoses of food allergies in young children before, during and after the guidelines were issued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can actually come to you today and say there are less kids with food allergy today than there would have been if we hadn’t implemented this public health effort,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that peanut allergies in children ages 0 to 3 declined by more than 27% after guidance for high-risk kids was first issued in 2015 and by more than 40% after the recommendations were expanded in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The effort hasn’t yet reduced an overall increase in food allergies in the U.S. in recent years. About 8% of children are affected, including more than 2% with a peanut allergy.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Peanut allergy is caused when the body’s immune system mistakenly identifies proteins in peanuts as harmful and releases chemicals that trigger allergic symptoms, including hives, respiratory symptoms and, sometimes, life-threatening anaphylaxis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, doctors had recommended delaying feeding children peanuts and other foods likely to trigger allergies until age 3. But in 2015, Gideon Lack at King’s College London, published the groundbreaking &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1414850" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Learning Early About Peanut Allergy,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or LEAP, trial. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Lack and colleagues showed that introducing peanut products in infancy reduced the future risk of developing food allergies by more than 80%. Later analysis showed that the protection persisted in about 70% of kids into adolescence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study immediately sparked new guidelines urging early introduction of peanuts — but putting them into practice has been slow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only about 29% of pediatricians and 65% of allergists reported following the expanded guidance issued in 2017, surveys found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confusion and uncertainty about the best way to introduce peanuts early in life led to the lag, according to a commentary that accompanied the study. Early on, medical experts and parents alike questioned whether the practice could be adopted outside of tightly controlled clinical settings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data for the analysis came from a subset of participating practice sites and may not represent the entire U.S. pediatric population, noted the commentary, led by Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a child allergy expert at Northwestern University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the new research offers “promising evidence that early allergen introduction is not only being adopted but may be making a measurable impact,” the authors concluded. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Advocates for the 33 million people in the U.S. with food allergies welcomed signs that early introduction of peanut products is catching on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research reinforces what we already know and underscores a meaningful opportunity to reduce the incidence and prevalence of peanut allergy nationwide,” said Sung Poblete, chief executive of the nonprofit group Food Allergy Research &amp;amp; Education, or FARE. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study emphasizes the current guidance, updated in 2021, which calls for introducing peanuts and other major food allergens between four and six months, without prior screening or testing, Hill said. Parents should consult their pediatricians about any questions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t have to be a lot of the food, but little tastes of peanut butter, milk-based yogurt, soy-based yogurts and tree butters,” he said. “These are really good ways to allow the immune system exposure to these allergenic foods in a safe way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiffany Leon, 36, a Maryland registered dietician and director at FARE, introduced peanuts and other allergens early to her own sons, James, 4, and Cameron, 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;At first, Leon’s own mother was shocked at the advice to feed babies such foods before the age of 3, she said. But Leon explained how the science had changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a dietician, I practice evidence-based recommendations,” she said. “So when someone told me, ‘This is how it’s done now, these are the new guidelines,’ I just though, OK, well, this is what we’re going to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;——-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

It’s a Thursday morning, not even 24 hours since my C-section. I’m watching my newborn son nap in his bassinet and trying to enjoy my first meal since surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The caller ID says CHKD Children’s Hospital, so I answer. My 16-month-old daughter was just released from that hospital earlier in the week following a severe bacterial infection that caused her lymph nodes to swell an extraordinary amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Hello?” I say, worried that they uncovered something concerning in her bloodwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Hello, I’m a pediatrician at Norfolk Children’s Hospital. I’m calling to check on Camille, and to let you know that she may have been exposed to the measles during her stay with us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;My heart dropped, and the post-surgery nausea that had nearly subsided suddenly returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The doctor proceeded to tell me that she was reading from a script, and that they (under the advisement of the &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/2025-news-releases/virginia-health-officials-confirm-measles-case-in-eastern-region/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Virginia Department of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Virginia Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;) were recommending that all young children exposed receive their second measles vaccine as soon as possible. She then asked me about the vaccination status of everyone else who visited my daughter at the hospital, including myself, my parents, my husband and my almost-3-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Thankfully, both of my daughters had their first measles shot, which grants immunity in &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/insights/2025/05/measles-risk-vaccination-young-old.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:up to 95% of individuals;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;up to 95% of individuals&lt;/a&gt;. However, I now have a vulnerable infant to consider, and even a small chance of exposing him to this virus with no protection is too big of a risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So, under the advice of our pediatrician, I decided to give both of my daughters their second measles-mumps-rubella vaccine early. I didn’t feel entirely comfortable with this decision — especially with my 16-month-old just recovering from an infection and borderline immunocompromised. But it was the best decision available to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And because of parents who opt out of vaccinating their kids, I was put in the position to make it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The recent measles scare in Virginia came from a student at a local elementary school. Though the individual’s vaccination status was not directly stated in a &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tKGC4YZAa4g6Vsua0qVEmN-zgZ3AxuJ6/view" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:letter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; from the Virginia Beach Department of Health or in an &lt;a href="https://www.wtkr.com/news/virginia-department-of-health-reports-measles-case-in-hampton-roads" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:interview;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with officials, several local outlets have taken this opportunity to advocate for the safety and continued necessity of childhood vaccinations. Of the 1,491 confirmed cases of measles in the U.S. this year, &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/infectious-disease/measles/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:92% occurred in individuals;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;92% occurred in individuals&lt;/a&gt; who were unvaccinated (or who had an unknown vaccination status).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In fact, &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/2025/us-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2025;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;2025&lt;/a&gt; boasts more measles cases since the disease was considered eliminated in 2000 — and more than any other year in the past three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/big-brains-podcast-why-measles-resurging-and-rise-vaccine-hesitancy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Low vaccination rates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Low vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; caused by vaccine hesitancy and anti-vaccine movements are largely to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In other words, parents who choose not to vaccinate their children play a major role in these outbreaks ― which will continue to rise if nothing changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Photo Courtesy Of Lauren Gumpert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The author's two daughters visiting their newest sibling at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As parents, we make hundreds of decisions on a daily basis — some inconsequential, others less so. We’re constantly weighing pros and cons, risks and benefits. In a world that feels more disconnected than ever — when we can bury our heads into our phones and surround ourselves with an echo chamber of conspiratorial ideas — it’s easy to lose sight of the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So let’s zoom out for a minute. In 1900, infectious diseases (such as pneumonia, influenza and measles) &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/health/402687/measles-outbreak-vaccine-kids-children-history" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:killed about 18% of children;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;killed about 18% of children&lt;/a&gt;. Before vaccines and other public health measures, 1 in 5 children did not live to see their first birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Compare that reality to today, when &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/health/402687/measles-outbreak-vaccine-kids-children-history" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:less than 1%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;less than 1%&lt;/a&gt; of children die before their fifth birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Back then, childhood was inherently dangerous. Even if they lived, those who became infected with a virus such as measles often suffered &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/measles-increases-disease-risk" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:long-term side effects;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;long-term side effects&lt;/a&gt; such as brain damage and a permanently weakened immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The success of public health measures such as vaccines has given people a &lt;a href="https://www.vaccinestoday.eu/stories/the-public-health-paradox-vaccines-are-a-victim-of-their-own-success/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:false sense of security;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;false sense of security&lt;/a&gt;, leading many to conclude that once-tragic diseases are no longer a threat. But it’s only thanks to science that illness and death among children is no longer commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nowadays, it’s easy to take our health for granted — especially with &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/18/rfk-jr-anti-vaxxer-vaccine-skeptic/#:~:text=Kennedy%20likes%20to%20say%20that,of%20how%20they%20describe%20themselves." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; steering the narrative at the helm of the Department of Health and Human Services. We have the luxury of arguing over genetically modified organisms and artificial food colors and doubting the effectiveness of the very things that have kept us safe for the past half-century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I won’t pretend to understand the various circumstances that might lead a parent not to vaccinate their child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But I do know that as parents (and human beings), we have a responsibility to protect all children. I’m reminded of a quote by author and activist &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10931895-there-s-no-such-thing-as-other-people-s-children" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Glennon Doyle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Glennon Doyle&lt;/a&gt; who said, “There’s no such thing as other people’s children.” We have an obligation to protect those who cannot opt to protect themselves. This is why I keep my kids home when they’re sick, why I advocate for stricter gun laws and — yes — why I vaccinate my kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Because measles is an airborne disease, one infected person can easily pass it on to &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/story-measles-five-charts" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:18 other people;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;18 other people&lt;/a&gt;. To achieve herd immunity, 95% of the population must be fully vaccinated. Unfortunately, vaccination rates among children have continued to decline since the COVID-19 pandemic, with &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/2025/across-the-us-childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline#:~:text=During%20the%202024%2D25%20school,prevent%20transmission%20of%20measles%20virus." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:only 92.5% of kindergartners;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;only 92.5% of kindergartners&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. reportedly vaccinated against measles last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Just this week, &lt;a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=5135#:~:text=Public%20Health%20Reminds%20Residents%20About,years%20after%20the%20initial%20diagnosis." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a school-aged child in California died;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a school-aged child in California died&lt;/a&gt; due to a delayed measles-related complication known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). The child contracted the disease in infancy before they were eligible for vaccination. If infected, my newborn son could suffer the same fate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I don’t want my kids — or anyone else’s — to become another preventable casualty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So, both of my daughters received their second MMR vaccine ahead of schedule. However, we still aren’t out of the woods, because measles &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/measles/#:~:text=If%20you%20think%20you%20might,discuss%20post%2Dexposure%20treatment%20options." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:symptoms can appear as late as 21 days after exposure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;symptoms can appear as late as 21 days after exposure&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.babycenter.com/health/doctor-visits-and-vaccines/my-child-developed-a-rash-about-a-week-after-receiving-the-m_1471851" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:about 5% of children;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;about 5% of children&lt;/a&gt; who receive their second vaccine develop a measles-like rash and fever, so it can be difficult to determine whether they have the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now I’m left to wonder and stress about every little bump that surfaces on my daughters’ skin. And if one of them does develop symptoms, I’ll have to contact the &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/2025-news-releases/virginia-health-officials-confirm-measles-case-in-eastern-region/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Virginia Department of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Virginia Department of Health&lt;/a&gt; to get them tested, because I can’t bring them to the pediatrician and risk exposing other vulnerable children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I understand why many parents have grown to distrust medical institutions. I’ve also had my fair share of negative experiences that sometimes make me doubt doctors’ recommendations and interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But overall, I believe that people in helping professions (like medicine) have good intentions. The millions of doctors and organizations supporting and promoting vaccine use would not intentionally harm children. RFK, on the other hand, seems to change his opinion often &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/12/politics/rfk-jrs-long-complicated-history-with-the-measles-vaccines" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:to suit his political agenda;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;to suit his political agenda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Despite the fact that a link between vaccines and autism has been disproven &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-vaccines-safe-and-effect-no-link-to-autism/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMultiple%20studies%20from%20around%20the,living%20rich%2C%20fulfilling%20lives.%E2%80%9D" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:over and over;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;over and over&lt;/a&gt;, RFK Jr. continues to spread lies and misinformation. He promised Americans that he would find a cause for the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/10/health/kennedy-autism-causes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:“autism epidemic”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;“autism epidemic”&lt;/a&gt; — a pursuit that won him support among many parents. However, with no formal medical or public health training, the secretary of health continues to undermine the scientific process by hiring incompetent individuals and misappropriating resources to maintain his base of support. For example, he recently employed a known &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/health/rfk-jr-autism-vaccines.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pseudoscientist;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;pseudoscientist&lt;/a&gt; to uncover a link between vaccines and autism (which, as previously stated, studies have found &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M18-2101?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:does not exist;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;does not exist&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In light of &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/18/nx-s1-5542082/cdc-acip-vaccine-hepatitis-b-mmrv" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recent threats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;recent threats&lt;/a&gt; to vaccine access, 34 scientific and medical organizations including the American Association of Immunologists and the American College of Physicians have come together to produce a &lt;a href="https://www.acponline.org/acp-newsroom/leading-organizations-unite-to-affirm-vaccine-safety-amid-rising-misinformation-and-declining-trust" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:statement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; reaffirming the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With so many conspiracy theories circulating on the internet, it can be difficult to know who to trust. As a result, many parents fail to recognize the far-reaching implications of their choices. A once-standard public health measure has become politicized and exploited — and our children will suffer because of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Mother Teresa said: “If we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The consequences of a decision like not vaccinating your child are not hypothetical. By now, hundreds of families in Virginia Beach like mine have been affected by one family’s choices. None of us live on an island, and our actions continue to ripple outward and affect others in unexpected ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In this life, we have no choice but to rely on each other. As parents, we have the power to end preventable deaths by vaccinating our children. I hope the vaccine skeptics among us will find the strength to do what’s necessary to keep all of our children safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/measles-exposure-anti-vaccine-movement_n_68d1bba8e4b03c190c21c872" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HuffPost;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;HuffPost&lt;/a&gt; in September 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News UK</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 02:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE9sNjdMVzRXbFZCRlpxNGhRdU51ZDVmbnFNZ3BheXJFOW8yVFY0YzFRbFRfdTRKLTNWVEZCMkVCWWU3eDdiS1c4Tl9nQmJVY2hQSHc2SUNERVpyczB4WHVSLWxZRFJxUllkY18wdG1SUQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
