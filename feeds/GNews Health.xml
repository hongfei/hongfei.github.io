So, he devised a treatment plan for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead of flooding a patient with drugs typically used to manage Alzheimer's, which can come with unpleasant side effects, Dr Bredesen takes a more tailored, holistic approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead of attacking the disease as a single condition, he looks at how it could be impacted by various metabolic and lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;When Judy Benjamin started forgetting her own phone number she knew something was wrong with her mind. The retiree from Norfolk, Virginia, was concerned she was displaying signed of Alzheimer's which had blighted her family and tests revealed she was correct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His strategy involves extensive testing to identify individual imbalances, followed by personalized interventions like dietary changes, supplements, exercise, sleep optimization, stress reduction and addressing potential environmental toxins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Benjamin started her treatment plan in 2011, and within months she saw her memory slowly return. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It took just over a year, she says, to fully reverse her symptoms of the progressive brain disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite Dr Bredesen's claims, the Alzheimer's Society notes that 'to date, there have been no clinically validated systems, medications or lifestyle changes proven to reverse Alzheimer's disease'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It adds, '[Dr] Bredesen's claims simply aren't backed by science. His research is limited, with papers that share anecdotal stories from 10 to 100 people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A larger sample size, replication of his protocol and more peer review are essential to determine if his claims are valid. Anecdotes alone are not enough evidence for a claim of this size.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some experts need further evidence that Dr Bredesen's methods work, Benjamin claims she is proof that they do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People often ask specifically what I did to reverse cognitive decline,' she told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The answer isn't simple because I had to completely change my lifestyle, food, sleep and exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I stopped eating sugar and artificial sweeteners, and ultra processed foods. I switched to organic food whenever possible and increased the variety of vegetables.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has shown that dietary choices can significantly impact cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diets high in certain nutrients, like omega-3 fatty acids found in fish and flaxseed and antioxidants, such as those found in many fruits, vegetables and other plant-based foods, are associated with better cognitive function and a lower risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;More than a decade on from her diagnosis, Benjamin (pictured) claims she has fully reversed her Alzheimer's and in a bid to raise awareness around her recovery, she is walking 3,000 miles across America&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Conversely, findings show that diets rich in saturated and trans fats, as well as ultra-processed foods, may contribute to cognitive decline and increase the risk of neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Off the back of these findings, Benjamin was advised to embrace a nutrient-rich diet, packed with organic, sugar-free and non-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'No sugar. No junk. No regrets. Just real food, real nutrients, and real results,' she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Benjamin, now 81 and a grandmother, also underwent an environmental toxins assessment, which analyzed her exposure to various harmful substances like heavy metals, pesticides and industrial chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results revealed Judy was living in a moldy home and was surrounded by high levels of mycotoxins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mycotoxins are toxic substances produced by fungi (molds) that can contaminate various agricultural products, including grains, nuts and dried fruits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They pose health risks to both humans and animals, potentially causing acute or chronic health effects upon ingestion, inhalation or contact with skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is also growing evidence suggesting a link between certain mycotoxins and harm to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Along the way, she has been joined and supported by friends, family and complete strangers who have been inspired by her undertaking. Benjamin is pictured crossing the California state line&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To solve the problem, Benjamin had the mold professionally removed from her home.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'After the mold was removed, I went through a lengthy detox protocol for my body that took several months,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her detox involved drinking plenty of water to support kidney function and flush out toxins through urination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, with her diet, she was told to focus on nutrient-dense produce such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and healthy fats, while avoiding processed foods, sugar, gluten and dairy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Next in Dr Bredesen's routine was getting Benjamin's sleep back on track. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told the Daily Mail she 'worked hard to improve my sleep, which had been horrible - sleeping sometimes only four or five hours a night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I learned to wind down in the evening, dim the lights, turn off all electronics and cool down the bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I began a daily meditation practice to reduce stress and took up yoga. I also started doing brain training exercises, in particular the program BrainHQ.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adequate sleep, particularly deep sleep, is crucial for clearing the brain of amyloid proteins, which are associated with Alzheimer's disease. If these are cleared it can lessen Alzheimer's symptoms, particularly when done early in the disease process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, activities like learning new skills, playing mentally stimulating games (like chess or puzzles), and engaging in social activities can help build a reserve of brain cells and connections, fending off dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with it not being backed by adequate science, the Alzheimer Society's other qualm about Dr Bredesen's protocol is its cost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The organization warns, 'There is a significant financial investment required to undergo the treatment protocol, including the program itself, testing, supplements, alternative therapies and special diets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Most, if not all of these treatments, are not covered by provincial or territorial health plans. A person may invest thousands of dollars – or more – in a program that has not been proven to reverse Alzheimer's disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After starting her journey on April 5, Benjamin's target is to make it to Saint Augustine, Florida, by Oct. 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the costs involved Benjamin, who is a former anthropologist and a board-certified health and wellness coach, went ahead with Dr Bredesen's protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After overhauling her life, she told the Mail the reversal of her Alzheimer's was 'gradual in various areas but some symptoms went away after three months, such as short term memory'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She found her driving ability improved, and she stopped getting lost and disorientated while on the road.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the first year of her rehabilitation, Benjamin found that when she became tired or had poor sleep, her symptoms would return temporarily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But she said she pushed through with the program and, over time, her setbacks became less frequent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's important to realize that it's a process that takes time,' she said. 'Just as it took time for the brain to become compromised. Patience and dedication to healing is important.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than a decade on from her diagnosis, Judy claims she has fully reversed her Alzheimer's and in a bid to raise awareness around her recovery, she is walking 3,000 miles across America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her route started in San Diego, California, and she is set to end in Saint Augustine, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So far, she is just over the 1,000 mile mark and has made it to Sierra Blanca, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The octogenarian says she didn't train specifically for the walk, but she is 'certain that years of focusing on physical fitness and strength paid off'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I have been quite shocked that not once have I become sore or have had any aches or pains associated with walking 17-22 miles a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In my first few days of walking, I developed a couple of blisters which were painful until they healed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Back home, her daily exercise regime comprises of 30 minutes of infrared sauna every morning, yoga and 10 minutes on a whole-body vibration platform. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The octogenarian says she didn't train specifically for the walk, but she is 'certain that years of focusing on physical fitness and strength paid off'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also bikes and goes to the gym regularly, and she has a walking platform under her stand-up desk at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On her walk, Benjamin friends, family and complete strangers have joined and supported her, all inspired by the undertaking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My hope is that by walking 3,000 miles across America at age 81, I will demonstrate to others that age is just a number, and one should not be held back because of age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I also want to let everyone know that memory loss can be reversed if caught in time and if one is willing to take the steps necessary to adopt a healthy lifestyle.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before starting out on yet another 10 hour day moving under the searing Texan sun, Benjamin adds, 'One very important benefit of my walk so far has been the incredible people I have met along the way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Everyone seems to know someone impacted by Alzheimer's.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After starting her journey on April 5, Benjamin's target is to make it to the finish line by Oct. 5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jul 2025 03:11:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxOMlhybXU1V2wyM1NXNXgtR0ZNZnZwSXhDZThjaTZrZWJtaW1rMllYTHR1Y2FMaWowZUtZSW1BRGRKNkNZUkdac2h4MWdKc0VELThmSC1ORnFfN1R2Vk5CU3FfR3dzS01sZ0dlMmFoNG4zVG1SNTBYT0dCWHJrVDlTSVdDRkNwMzlvQ1l3X2Nqd0VQUURVYnU2ZFlpMVBNTFU</guid></item><item><title>发现肠道细菌可永久吸收有毒化学物质- ScienceAlert | Gut Bacteria Found to Soak Up Toxic Forever Chemicals - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxOZnNnSGlQQUJfUGtxcHpIQWZBOGZtYk1hZFEtaVdqQ1Q1OHlRVTh1RTZVRTRoVGN0dC13Y1FqYnE3SUNkU0M0Ykw5VDhUcExUeTIwZG5BYTdYOFVpNmI1cFExZzBtN1l1MlF1X0NhMHRSam83TXNfN3FXT1RVYndSdHFFRExySWl5MEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PFAS"&gt;Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances&lt;/a&gt; (PFAS) have the nickname 'forever chemicals' thanks to their persistence &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/forever-chemicals-seep-through-human-skin-alarming-study-confirms"&gt;in the environment&lt;/a&gt;. While a handful of bacteria are known to mop up these insidious compounds, it's unclear whether any of our own microflora hide such a talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study by an international team of researchers has shown how several species of human gut bacteria can absorb and store PFAS. Potentially, boosting these types of bacteria in our bodies could stop the chemicals from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/forever-chemicals-in-us-drinking-water-linked-to-cancer-scientists-find"&gt;negatively impacting our health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that certain species of human gut bacteria have a remarkably high capacity to soak up PFAS from their environment at a range of concentrations, and store these in clumps inside their cells," &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/gut-microbes-could-protect-us-from-toxic-forever-chemicals"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Kiran Patil, a molecular biologist from the University of Cambridge in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Due to aggregation of PFAS in these clumps, the bacteria themselves seem protected from the toxic effects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/game-changer-hot-new-tech-turns-forever-chemicals-into-valuable-resource?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;'Game Changer': Hot New Tech Turns Forever Chemicals Into Valuable Resource&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through detailed lab tests, the researchers found a total of 38 different gut bacterial strains able to absorb forever chemicals at a variety of concentrations, with the fiber-degrading bacterium &lt;a href="https://healthmatters.io/understand-blood-test-results/bacteroides-uniformis"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bacteroides uniformis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; one of the best at the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166562" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166562" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/PFASChart.jpg" alt="PFAS and bacteria chart" class="wp-image-166562 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/PFASChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/PFASChart-600x364.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166562" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers analyzed how bacteria reacted to PFAS. (Lindell et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Microbiology&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the team also discovered certain mechanisms that could make bacteria more or less effective at taking on board PFAS – something that will be useful if this absorption can be bioengineered in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that PFAS were effectively locked away in the bacteria that could handle the chemicals, the bacteria clustering together in a way that reduces their surface area and possibly protects the microorganisms &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-toxic-synergy-arises-when-forever-chemicals-merge-with-microplastics"&gt;from being harmed&lt;/a&gt; themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further tests on mice with nine of these bacteria species implanted in their guts showed that the microbes were able to quickly absorb PFAS, which was excreted from the mice through their feces. As levels of forever chemicals increased, the microbes worked harder at soaking them up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The reality is that PFAS are already in the environment and in our bodies, and we need to try and mitigate their impact on our health now," &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/gut-microbes-could-protect-us-from-toxic-forever-chemicals"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; molecular biologist Indra Roux from the University of Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We haven't found a way to destroy PFAS, but our findings open the possibility of developing ways to get them out of our bodies where they do the most harm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PFAS are found in everything &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-toxicology-expert-switched-cosmetics-after-checking-the-label-heres-why"&gt;from cosmetics&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-epa-just-issued-new-drinking-water-limits-for-forever-chemicals"&gt;drinking water&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-find-3600-food-packaging-chemicals-in-human-bodies"&gt;food packaging&lt;/a&gt;, and have become embedded in so many manufacturing processes that it would now be almost impossible to avoid them completely. What's less clear is the harm they might be doing &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/pfas/our-current-understanding-human-health-and-environmental-risks-pfas"&gt;to our bodies&lt;/a&gt;, though they've already been linked to a number of health issues – including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/forever-chemicals-may-damage-kidney-function-evidence-shows"&gt;kidney damage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria's ability to remove PFAS from human bodies remains to be seen. It is possible, the researchers say, that probiotic dietary supplements may be developed to boost the right mix of gut microbes and help safely clear out PFAS from our systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given the scale of the problem of PFAS 'forever chemicals', particularly their effects on human health, it's concerning that so little is being done about removing these from our bodies," &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/gut-microbes-could-protect-us-from-toxic-forever-chemicals"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Patil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-025-02032-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Microbiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Prescription drugs help many sufferers, yet side effects, cost, and uneven results often leave patients and clinicians on the lookout for other solutions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then one day, as with all urban myths, one person told another who told another about a home remedy that never seems to fail. If you want to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/is-depression-contagious-couples-may-share-it-through-kissing/"&gt;beat depression&lt;/a&gt;, taking just one spoonful of vinegar every day will wash those blue away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you stop and think about it for a minute, diet does seem like an obvious place to turn for cures to most any ailment. After all, the body and mind operate on what we feed them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could the same sour splash that wakes up a salad also nudge a weary mind toward optimism? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two small &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04706806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;clinical trials suggests&lt;/a&gt; that the idea of treating depression with a spoonful of vinegar is definitely worth more attention from medical professionals and the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-vinegars-impact-on-depression"&gt;Studying vinegars impact on depression&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fermented vinegars have had a place in folk remedies for centuries, prized for their ability to tame &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-this-amount-of-water-per-day-helps-control-blood-sugar-levels-in-people-with-diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood sugar spikes&lt;/a&gt; and add zest without salt or fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific studies over the past decade have confirmed some metabolic perks, yet mental health has been missing from the conversation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That gap inspired a team of nutrition researchers to see whether swallowing some vinegar on a regular schedule could ease depression by influencing mood-related chemistry as well as subjective feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by &lt;a href="https://www.asu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Arizona State University&lt;/a&gt; dietitian Haley Barrong, the investigators recruited 28 overweight but otherwise healthy adults and randomly assigned them to one of two groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half drank two tablespoons of red wine vinegar diluted in water twice a day, while the rest swallowed a capsule containing only a trace of vinegar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-team-learned"&gt;What the team learned&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over four weeks, all participants completed the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression questionnaire (&lt;a href="https://nida.nih.gov/sites/default/files/Mental_HealthV.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CES-D&lt;/a&gt;) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (&lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/fastlab/research/imapp/msrs/_jcr_content/main/accordion/accordion_content3/download_256324296/file.res/PHQ9%20id%20date%2008.03.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PHQ-9&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scores on the CES-D hardly budged, yet the PHQ-9 told another story. In the vinegar group, reported depressive symptoms fell by an average of 42 percent, compared with an 18 percent dip in the pill group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After reviewing the data, the authors wrote, “This data provides additional support that daily vinegar ingestion over four weeks can improve self-reported depression symptomology in generally healthy adults and that alterations in [&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/vitamin-b-paradox-supplement-linked-to-heart-disease-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;vitamin B3&lt;/a&gt;] metabolism may factor into this improvement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vinegar-depression-and-blood"&gt;Vinegar, depression, and blood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also collected blood samples to watch biochemical pathways at work. The most striking change was an 86 percent surge in nicotinamide, a form of vitamin B3 that feeds into the NAD⁺ salvage pathway responsible for cellular energy recycling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher nicotinamide aligns with lower inflammation, a relationship that has caught psychiatric interest before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two metabolites – &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-less-of-this-amino-acid-isoleucine-boosts-lifespan-in-mice-an-average-of-33-percent/"&gt;isoleucine&lt;/a&gt;, a branched-chain amino acid, and &lt;a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isobutyric-acid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;isobutyric acid&lt;/a&gt; – shifted as well, hinting that vinegar tweaks broader metabolic networks tied to mood regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Depressive disorders are the most prevalent mental health conditions in the world,” write the researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The commonly prescribed antidepressant medications can have serious side effects, and their efficacy varies widely. Thus, simple, effective adjunct therapies are needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-vinegar-might-lift-mood"&gt;How vinegar might lift mood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several mechanisms could explain the modest improvements. Acetic acid, the defining ingredient in vinegar, activates AMP-activated &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/studies-learn-the-exact-amount-of-time-you-should-spend-training-to-build-muscle/"&gt;protein kinase&lt;/a&gt;, an energy sensor linked to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25308486/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NAD⁺ production&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More NAD⁺ means brain cells repair DNA damage more effectively and maintain healthy mitochondria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possibility involves the gut. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientifically-proven-tips-for-better-kombucha-brewing/"&gt;Acetic acid&lt;/a&gt; can encourage growth of friendly bacteria that generate neurotransmitter precursors, forging a gut-brain feedback loop many neuroscientists now consider crucial to emotional balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lab work in mice has already shown that boosting NAD⁺ protects neurons from stress hormones, while human studies connect higher dietary vitamin B3 with lower depression risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The present human trial knits those ideas together: swallow vinegar, raise nicotinamide levels, and perhaps give the brain an energetic lift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-depression-vinegar-and-health"&gt;Depression, vinegar, and health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of this turns vinegar into a standalone treatment. The experiment lasted only a month, involved people with mild symptoms, and lost some statistical punch after adjusting for baseline scores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, swallowing a familiar pantry staple twice a day costs pennies and carries few risks for most adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Future research examining the effects of vinegar administration in clinically depressed or at-risk populations, and those on antidepressant medications, is warranted,” the authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A focus on mechanisms and large patient samples will strengthen the science and provide the evidence to more firmly demonstrate vinegar’s role in health promotion.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until those larger trials wrap up, dietitians may simply remind clients that incorporating two tablespoons of red wine or apple cider vinegar into meals is safe for most, provided they dilute it and protect their teeth by rinsing with water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-studies-on-depression-and-vinegar"&gt;Future studies on depression and vinegar&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People interested in trying the routine might start by whisking vinegar into dressings or stirring it into a tall glass of water before lunch and dinner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/junk-food-diet-triggers-lasting-changes-in-the-brain/"&gt;acid reflux&lt;/a&gt;, kidney issues, or current prescriptions should check with a clinician first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-nature-heals-outdoor-activities-greatly-improve-mental-health/"&gt;Mental health&lt;/a&gt; professionals could eventually blend such low-cost dietary tweaks with therapy and medication, tailoring care to each person’s biology and preferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notion that mood can shift alongside something as ordinary as a mealtime condiment highlights how tightly body and mind intertwine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vinegar will never replace professional treatment, yet its potential to turn that frown upside down – especially for those reluctant to take pharmaceuticals – deserves the careful follow-up studies that this research team calls for. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/14/2305" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jul 2025 02:06:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxPVTE2d05VcHRjRUdiUGgxTUEwZkUxaWxBcnBIRU1qTFl3RkhWRmp3dFc2eWM1Tnp2VXBtb0lYLWRBdGM0YzFmTHdmbjE3ckJwWFNNVFd6NE9sZHhoYld1ellxLUZVeERWTU5qWlFMSU1EcDJsc25kOVpIYk9PR3JpLVd3Q3dCZlVlMGxkQU1DVHQ2TTVaSEllWXRaaXVRcVJSUjJRQ24xR2JjRTNWR2VyZG1R</guid></item><item><title>休克研究揭示了出生类型如何影响儿童患癌症的机会-每日邮报 | Shock research reveals how types of birth can affect children's chances of getting CANCER - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

And researchers found the risk of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), which is the most common form of childhood leukaemia, was 21 per cent higher in children born by planned C-section compared to children born naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Babies born by planned caesarean section are more likely to develop childhood cancer, according to researchers. Pictured: Stock image&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Those delivered that way were more than a quarter more likely to get the most common form of childhood leukaemia, a study found. Pictured: Stock image&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This increased to 29 per cent in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL), which is the most common ALL subtype, accounting for around 80 per cent of childhood cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the raised risk was more pronounced in boys than girls, as well as among younger children, according to the findings from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm published in the International Journal of Cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts suggest that the raised risk could be due to the baby not being exposed to the stress of a natural delivery, as well as bacteria in the birth canal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is thought that babies born via planned caesarean have higher chances of developing health conditions such as asthma and food allergies for the same reason. But, because during an emergency C-section labour has begun naturally, the baby may have had some exposure and the risk is less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Christina-Evmorfia Kampitsi, the study’s lead author, said: ‘C-sections are an important and often life-saving part of obstetric care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We don’t want mothers to feel anxious about medically indicated C-sections. But when this result is combined with other study results showing that the risk of later asthma, allergies or type 1 diabetes increases in children born by planned C-section, there is reason to discuss C-sections that are not medically indicated.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But getting quality brain tissue samples from adult humans is extremely challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Human tissue comes from autopsies or surgeries, so how it's handled — how long before it's fixed in preservative, which chemicals are used, how thin the slices are — can hide those newborn cells," Paterlini said. Employing new technologies enabled the team to overcome this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They analyzed more than 400,000 individual nuclei of hippocampus cells from 24 people, and in addition, looked at 10 other brains using other techniques. The brains came from people ages 0 to 78, including six children and four teens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using two cutting-edge imaging methods, the team mapped where new cells sat in the tissue. They saw groups of dividing precursor cells sitting right next to the fully formed neurons, in the same spots where animal studies have shown that adult stem cells reside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We didn't just see these dividing precursor cells in babies and young kids — we also found them in teenagers and adults," Paterlini said. "These include stem cells that can renew themselves and give rise to other brain cells."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newer technologies enabled the researchers to detect the new brain cells at various stages of development and conduct research that wouldn't have been possible a few years ago, Ratan added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also used fluorescent tags to mark the proliferating cells. This enabled them to build a machine learning algorithm that identified the cells that they knew would turn into neurogenic stem cells, based on past rodent studies. This was a "clever approach" for tackling the challenges of studying brain-cell formation in adolescents and adults, Ratan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, the brains of children produced more new brain cells than the brains of adolescents or adults did. Meanwhile, nine out of 14 adult brains analyzed with one technique showed signs of neurogenesis, while 10 out of 10 adult brains analyzed with a second technique bore new cells. Regarding the few brains with no new cells, Paterlini said it's too soon to draw conclusions about the disparity between adult brains with evidence of new cells and those without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers could explore whether the adults who produced new brain cells did so in response to a neurological disease, such as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/65748-alzheimers-disease.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/65748-alzheimers-disease.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or whether adult neurogenesis is a sign of good brain health, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/18498/w-taylor-kimberly" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/18498/w-taylor-kimberly" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. W. Taylor Kimberly&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, chief of neurocritical care at Massachusetts General Brigham, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They were able to find these needles in a haystack," Kimberly told Live Science. "Once you detect them and learn about them and understand their regulation," scientists can research how to track the precursor cells through time and see how their presence relates to disease, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He envisioned comparing patients who have dementia to "super agers" who are cognitively resilient in old age. If the link between neurogenesis and disease can be uncovered, perhaps that could open the door to treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although the precise therapeutic strategies in humans are still under active research," Paterlini said, "the very fact that our adult brains can sprout new neurons transforms how we think about lifelong learning, recovery from injury and the untapped potential of neural plasticity."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

For decades, the uncanny deaths of the excavation team who uncovered the &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/world/1971846/tutankhamun-mystery-deepens-archaeology-death-mask"&gt;Egyptian king&lt;/a&gt;'s resting place in 1922 were linked to a supernatural "pharaoh's curse". Scientists now believe the mystifying illness that killed them off was a toxic fungus known as &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/science/2051077/killer-fungus-spread-across-europe"&gt;Aspergillus flavus&lt;/a&gt;, which can lie dormant in a sealed environment - such as a tomb - for thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mce-linkchecker-status="valid"&gt;It is known for its resilience in harsh environments, and, once disturbed, can unleash deadly spores, potentially triggering serious breathing problems in those with weakened immune systems. However, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania believe the fungus could be a game-changer in the global &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/latest/cancer?pageNumber=137"&gt;fight against cancer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team discovered that the fungus produces compounds called asperigimycins, which can be as effective as cytarabine and daunorubicin - two FCDA-approved drugs that have been used in &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/uk/2053352/Groundbreaking-treatment-kills-aggressive-blood-cancer-sparing-healthy-cells"&gt;leukaemia&lt;/a&gt; chemotherapy for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The asperigimycins appear to work by disrupting the process of cancer cell division through blocking the formation of microtubules - but the cancer-fighting properties only applied to leukaemia, rather than other variants of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ovp-primis"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mce-linkchecker-status="valid"&gt;Nonetheless, it's an impressive redemption story for the toxic mould, traces of which were also found during investigations into the deaths of scientists who entered the tomb of 15th-century Polish king Casimir IV in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="div-gpt-ad-in-line-first-slot" class="ad-container" data-tb-non-consent="taboola-mid-article-express" data-tb-mode="thumbnails-mid" data-tb-placement="Mid Article Express" data-tb-target-type="mix"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists who made the discovery also identified similar clusters of genes in other fungi, sparking hope that other natural remedies to cancer could already exist in nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fungi have us penicillin," Sherry Gao, senior author of the paper on the findings, said. "These results show that many more medicines derived from natural products remain to be found."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nature has given us this incredible pharmacy," she added.

			&lt;p data-start="281" data-end="623"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In an incredible twist of fate that feels like something out of a feel-good movie, a firefighter in Florida discovered a newborn girl in a Safe Haven Baby Box and ultimately chose to adopt her. His heartfelt decision to publicly share the story aims to reassure the biological mother that her child is loved, cared for, and in good hands.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-start="281" data-end="623"&gt;&lt;span id="more-8928"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="625" data-end="688"&gt;The Safe Haven Baby Box: A Lifeline for Vulnerable Newborns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="690" data-end="1356"&gt;For those unfamiliar with the concept, &lt;strong data-start="729" data-end="754"&gt;Safe Haven Baby Boxes&lt;/strong&gt; are designed to provide a secure, anonymous option for mothers in crisis to safely leave their newborns. These boxes are equipped with alarms and are usually located in &lt;strong data-start="924" data-end="941"&gt;fire stations&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong data-start="943" data-end="956"&gt;hospitals&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong data-start="962" data-end="984"&gt;police departments&lt;/strong&gt;. The initiative is part of a broader effort to offer a compassionate solution for mothers who are unable or unwilling to care for their newborns, ensuring the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://glassalmanac.com/parents-can-create-narcissistic-children/"&gt;child&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is immediately cared for in a safe environment. According to the National Safe Haven Alliance, more than &lt;strong data-start="1255" data-end="1264"&gt;3,000&lt;/strong&gt; babies have been safely surrendered using Safe Haven laws across the U.S. since the 1990s.¹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 data-start="1358" data-end="1381"&gt;A Night to Remember&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1383" data-end="1800"&gt;The story of this little girl, now named &lt;strong data-start="1424" data-end="1432"&gt;Zoey&lt;/strong&gt;, began one cold night in &lt;strong data-start="1458" data-end="1474"&gt;January 2023&lt;/strong&gt;. A firefighter, who has chosen to remain anonymous, was on duty at the fire station in &lt;strong data-start="1562" data-end="1580"&gt;Ocala, Florida&lt;/strong&gt;, when he was awakened by the sound of the baby box’s alarm around &lt;strong data-start="1647" data-end="1655"&gt;2 AM&lt;/strong&gt;. At first, he assumed it might be a false alarm, but he was stunned when he opened the box to find a tiny, swaddled baby girl in a pink blanket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1802" data-end="2158"&gt;The moment was surreal. Zoey’s arrival, though unexpected, felt like a divine sign to the firefighter. After ensuring she was safely taken to the hospital, he and his wife, who had been facing struggles with conceiving and had been considering adoption, felt an immediate bond with her. They knew that this baby had been sent into their lives for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1802" data-end="2158"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8930" src="https://glassalmanac.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/baby-girl-1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://glassalmanac.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/baby-girl-1.jpg 1200w, https://glassalmanac.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/baby-girl-1-300x195.jpg 300w, https://glassalmanac.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/baby-girl-1-1024x666.jpg 1024w, https://glassalmanac.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/baby-girl-1-768x499.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 data-start="2160" data-end="2180"&gt;A Dream Realized&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2182" data-end="2577"&gt;For the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://glassalmanac.com/heres-the-impressive-new-robot-dog-of-the-chinese-fire-department/"&gt;firefighter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and his wife, the dream of starting a family had seemed elusive. After facing years of challenges with conception, they had started to explore adoption. The sudden appearance of Zoey seemed like an answer to their prayers. In a heartwarming turn, just two days later, Zoey was brought to her new home, where she would officially become part of their family by &lt;strong data-start="2562" data-end="2576"&gt;April 2023&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2579" data-end="2962"&gt;The firefighter’s account of the events is filled with emotion. He spoke openly about how he felt guided by something greater during that fateful night. “The way I found her… it was God guiding us,” he said, choking back tears. His words reflect the deep sense of gratitude and awe he feels, as if this moment of serendipity was a clear sign that Zoey was meant to be their daughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-start="2579" data-end="2962"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8931" src="https://glassalmanac.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/baby-girl-2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://glassalmanac.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/baby-girl-2.jpg 1200w, https://glassalmanac.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/baby-girl-2-256x300.jpg 256w, https://glassalmanac.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/baby-girl-2-875x1024.jpg 875w, https://glassalmanac.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/baby-girl-2-768x899.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2964" data-end="2985"&gt;A Message of Hope&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2987" data-end="3444"&gt;The firefighter and his wife decided to share their story with the public to send a message of hope to Zoey’s biological mother. The firefighter hopes she will find peace knowing that her daughter is in a loving home, surrounded by care and support. His openness serves as not only a personal reflection of joy but also a celebration of the &lt;strong data-start="3328" data-end="3351"&gt;Safe Haven Baby Box²&lt;/strong&gt; program and its role in providing life-changing opportunities for both parents and children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-start="3446" data-end="3858"&gt;This story serves as a beautiful reminder of the power of compassion and the unexpected ways families can come together. Zoey’s journey, from the safety of a baby box to the warmth of a loving family, is a testament to how kindness and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://glassalmanac.com/could-humans-transform-into-another-species-discover-the-neurobiology-behind-it/"&gt;human connection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; can change lives for the better. It’s a story of love, hope, and the unbreakable bond that can form between parent and child, no matter how they come together.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANOKA COUNTY, Minn. — Officials in Minnesota have confirmed the West Nile virus was detected in mosquito pools in the state this week.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Metropolitan Mosquito Control District reported the virus was detected in Anoka and Carver Counties. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These are the first positive samples of the year for each of these two counties and an indication that mosquito-borne disease activity is beginning to increase," said Alex Carlson, a spokesman for the agency.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early July is the typical time for the agency to begin detecting the virus, added Carlson. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least one Minnesotan and two people from Wisconsin died after contracting the &lt;a href="/article/news/local/fatal-west-nile-virus-cases-reported-wisconsin-minnesota-experiences-milder-season/89-76a2be94-1fe3-4c4b-b8a6-26744c2f14a6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;virus last year&lt;/a&gt;, but confirmed cases of the illness have steadily declined over the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency is advising residents to wear insect repellent, avoid the outdoors during dawn and dusk during peak mosquito activity and eliminate any standing water. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p data-start="82" data-end="498"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With winter viruses making their rounds, many of us are looking for ways to boost our immune system and protect ourselves from the common cold, flu, and other seasonal illnesses. But what if the very thing many of us turn to for relaxation could actually be undermining our health? According to nutrition experts, one common drink is linked to a weakened immune response. The surprising culprit? Alcohol.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-start="82" data-end="498"&gt;&lt;span id="more-8925"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="500" data-end="541"&gt;How Alcohol Affects the Immune System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="543" data-end="873"&gt;We’ve all heard that certain foods and drinks can help support our &lt;a href="https://glassalmanac.com/could-a-monkey-herpes-virus-be-the-key-to-conquering-cancer/"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="610" data-end="627"&gt;immune system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;strong data-start="633" data-end="644"&gt;alcohol&lt;/strong&gt; is a different story. For years, experts have been warning about the negative effects of &lt;strong data-start="734" data-end="745"&gt;alcohol&lt;/strong&gt; on various aspects of our health, and now, it’s clear that it also plays a significant role in suppressing &lt;strong data-start="853" data-end="872"&gt;immune function&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 data-start="875" data-end="909"&gt;Dehydration: The First Setback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="911" data-end="1557"&gt;One of the main reasons &lt;strong data-start="935" data-end="946"&gt;alcohol&lt;/strong&gt; harms the &lt;strong data-start="957" data-end="974"&gt;immune system&lt;/strong&gt; is through dehydration. &lt;strong data-start="999" data-end="1010"&gt;Alcohol&lt;/strong&gt; has a &lt;strong data-start="1017" data-end="1036"&gt;diuretic effect&lt;/strong&gt;, which means it causes the body to lose more fluid than it takes in. According to &lt;strong data-start="1119" data-end="1136"&gt;Roxana Ehsani&lt;/strong&gt;, a registered dietitian-nutritionist, &lt;strong data-start="1175" data-end="1186"&gt;alcohol&lt;/strong&gt; can lead to significant dehydration, which in turn prevents the &lt;strong data-start="1251" data-end="1268"&gt;immune system&lt;/strong&gt; from working properly. Without sufficient hydration, the body struggles to produce &lt;strong data-start="1352" data-end="1366"&gt;antibodies&lt;/strong&gt; and fight off infections. This is why after a night of heavy drinking, many of us feel rundown or sick; the body is literally too dehydrated to respond effectively to invaders like viruses.¹&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1559" data-end="1584"&gt;Disrupting Gut Health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1586" data-end="2167"&gt;Another significant impact of &lt;strong data-start="1616" data-end="1627"&gt;alcohol&lt;/strong&gt; on the &lt;strong data-start="1635" data-end="1652"&gt;immune system&lt;/strong&gt; is its effect on &lt;a href="https://glassalmanac.com/should-you-have-a-bowel-movement-every-day-gastroenterologists-answer/"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1670" data-end="1684"&gt;gut health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The intestines are the first point of contact for &lt;strong data-start="1736" data-end="1747"&gt;alcohol&lt;/strong&gt;, and when consumed in excess, &lt;strong data-start="1778" data-end="1789"&gt;alcohol&lt;/strong&gt; can disrupt the &lt;strong data-start="1806" data-end="1824"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/strong&gt;—the beneficial bacteria that play a crucial role in digestion and &lt;strong data-start="1891" data-end="1909"&gt;immune defense&lt;/strong&gt;. As &lt;strong data-start="1914" data-end="1931"&gt;Roxana Ehsani&lt;/strong&gt; explains, &lt;strong data-start="1942" data-end="1953"&gt;alcohol&lt;/strong&gt; damages these good bacteria, making it harder for the &lt;strong data-start="2008" data-end="2025"&gt;immune system&lt;/strong&gt; to function properly. A weakened microbiome means the body is less capable of fighting off pathogens, leaving us more vulnerable to illness.²&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2169" data-end="2211"&gt;High Sugar Content in Alcoholic Drinks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2213" data-end="2712"&gt;Let’s not forget about the &lt;strong data-start="2240" data-end="2249"&gt;sugar&lt;/strong&gt; in many alcoholic beverages, especially &lt;strong data-start="2290" data-end="2303"&gt;cocktails&lt;/strong&gt;. These drinks often contain syrups and juices that spike &lt;strong data-start="2361" data-end="2376"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; levels. High blood sugar can impair the functioning of &lt;strong data-start="2432" data-end="2448"&gt;immune cells&lt;/strong&gt;, preventing them from doing their job of warding off infections. In fact, &lt;strong data-start="2523" data-end="2540"&gt;nutritionists&lt;/strong&gt; have warned that the combination of &lt;strong data-start="2577" data-end="2588"&gt;alcohol&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong data-start="2593" data-end="2602"&gt;sugar&lt;/strong&gt; could make the &lt;strong data-start="2618" data-end="2635"&gt;immune system&lt;/strong&gt; more sluggish and less responsive, particularly during cold and flu season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 data-start="2714" data-end="2761"&gt;The Cumulative Effect of Excessive Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2763" data-end="3325"&gt;The negative effects of &lt;strong data-start="2787" data-end="2798"&gt;alcohol&lt;/strong&gt; don’t stop after one drink. Drinking too much can exacerbate all of the issues mentioned above—&lt;strong data-start="2894" data-end="2909"&gt;dehydration&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong data-start="2911" data-end="2929"&gt;gut disruption&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong data-start="2935" data-end="2953"&gt;sugar overload&lt;/strong&gt;. To keep the &lt;strong data-start="2967" data-end="2984"&gt;immune system&lt;/strong&gt; at its best, health experts recommend limiting &lt;strong data-start="3032" data-end="3043"&gt;alcohol&lt;/strong&gt; consumption to no more than two drinks per day, and not every day. Going beyond these guidelines can severely compromise the &lt;strong data-start="3169" data-end="3186"&gt;immune system&lt;/strong&gt; and increase the risk of other health issues, like &lt;a href="https://glassalmanac.com/study-shows-that-this-oil-increases-the-risk-of-stroke/"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3238" data-end="3265"&gt;cardiovascular diseases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;strong data-start="3270" data-end="3280"&gt;cancer&lt;/strong&gt;, as highlighted by &lt;strong data-start="3300" data-end="3323"&gt;Alcool Info Service&lt;/strong&gt;.³&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3327" data-end="3372"&gt;So, How Can We Protect Our Immune System?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3374" data-end="3791"&gt;As the cold weather sets in and flu season picks up, it’s important to be mindful of what we consume. While moderate &lt;strong data-start="3491" data-end="3502"&gt;alcohol&lt;/strong&gt; intake is unlikely to destroy our &lt;strong data-start="3537" data-end="3554"&gt;immune system&lt;/strong&gt;, limiting our &lt;strong data-start="3569" data-end="3592"&gt;alcohol consumption&lt;/strong&gt; and staying hydrated can go a long way in keeping us strong and healthy. Along with this, maintaining a balanced diet with plenty of &lt;strong data-start="3726" data-end="3736"&gt;fruits&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong data-start="3738" data-end="3752"&gt;vegetables&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong data-start="3758" data-end="3783"&gt;immune-boosting foods&lt;/strong&gt; is key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-start="3793" data-end="4091"&gt;The next time you’re reaching for that glass of &lt;strong data-start="3841" data-end="3849"&gt;wine&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong data-start="3853" data-end="3865"&gt;cocktail&lt;/strong&gt;, consider the toll it could be taking on your body’s ability to fight off illness. Maybe it’s time to give your &lt;strong data-start="3978" data-end="3995"&gt;immune system&lt;/strong&gt; a helping hand by cutting back on &lt;a href="https://glassalmanac.com/baby-ends-up-in-alcoholic-coma-after-grandmother-uses-wine-instead-of-water-in-bottle/"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4030" data-end="4041"&gt;alcohol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this season—and keeping those winter bugs at bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-ranking federal officials have suggested that bird flu virus should be left to "rip" through poultry farms across the U.S. — but experts warn that this hands-off approach could hasten the beginning of a new &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/tag/pandemic" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/tag/pandemic"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of Health and Human Services, and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/AmericaNewsroom/status/1894798813681827949" target="_blank" data-url="https://x.com/AmericaNewsroom/status/1894798813681827949" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Brooke Rollins&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, secretary of Agriculture, have floated the notion that instead of culling birds infected with the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, farmers should let it spread through flocks. The idea is that by doing this, farmers can "identify the birds, and preserve the birds, that are immune to it," Kennedy &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;told Fox News&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on March 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a perspective piece authored by a group of virologists, veterinarians and health security experts argues that the plan would not only be ineffective, but could also increase the risk of the virus spilling over into humans and sparking a new pandemic. The researchers published their arguments July 3 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adx8639?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D35808480360802919781961414062707582420%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1751458430" target="_blank" data-url="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adx8639?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D35808480360802919781961414062707582420%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1751458430" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Science&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Essentially, the longer you allow a virus that has shown to be effective in infecting multiple hosts survive in an environment, the greater the chance you give it to spread, to mutate, and to try its luck at adaptation," perspective first-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/who-we-are/our-people/erin-m-sorrell" target="_blank" data-url="https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/who-we-are/our-people/erin-m-sorrell" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Erin Sorrell&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a virologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told Live Science. "Worse case scenario, the virus adapts and expands its host range to become transmissible in humans … Now we have a pandemic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="bird-flu-in-the-u-s-3"&gt;Bird flu in the U.S. &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;H5N1 is a subtype of highly pathogenic avian &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/54509-flu-influenza.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/54509-flu-influenza.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;influenza&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (HPAI), a type of bird flu that can cause severe disease and death in poultry and other birds. Since the virus began spreading widely among U.S. birds in January 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/data-map-commercial.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/data-map-commercial.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;has reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that more than 174 million birds across all 50 states have been infected with the disease. The virus’s transmission among wild aquatic birds, commercial poultry and backyard, hobbyist flocks, has led to massive culls in farms and sent egg prices skyrocketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus typically transmits among wild birds and poultry, but it's known to have also infected more than &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/30/3/23-1098_article" target="_blank" data-url="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/30/3/23-1098_article" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;48 mammal species&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including foxes, skunks, raccoons, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/animals/seals/bird-flu-wipes-out-over-95-of-southern-elephant-seal-pups-in-catastrophic-mass-death" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/animals/seals/bird-flu-wipes-out-over-95-of-southern-elephant-seal-pups-in-catastrophic-mass-death"&gt;&lt;u&gt;seals&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/animals/polar-bears/this-is-unlikely-to-be-an-isolated-event-1st-polar-bear-death-from-bird-flu-spells-trouble-for-species" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/animals/polar-bears/this-is-unlikely-to-be-an-isolated-event-1st-polar-bear-death-from-bird-flu-spells-trouble-for-species"&gt;&lt;u&gt;polar bears&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

This is because, while the disease can spread among different animals, it currently can't be passed from human to human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="federal-plans-3"&gt;Federal plans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rollins recently issued updates about the U.S. government's plan to combat the infection's spread and lower egg prices.

The government is also exploring ways to slash regulations and increase temporary import options for eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current regulations state that when infections are detected among commercial poultry, farmers must cull the affected flocks to contain the disease's spread, for which they are financially compensated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet suggestions made by officials for more radical ways to manage bird flu have left experts concerned. In May, Kennedy and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.doctoroz.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.doctoroz.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Mehmet Oz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the administrator for the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/world/canada/ostriches-avian-flu-rfk-jr-dr-oz.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/world/canada/ostriches-avian-flu-rfk-jr-dr-oz.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;voiced their support&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the owners of a Canadian ostrich farm whose 398 birds faced a cull following confirmed cases of H5N1 bird flu in December 2024 and January this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe significant scientific knowledge may be garnered from following the ostriches in a controlled environment," Kennedy wrote in a letter &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1926053244477886825?s=46" target="_blank" data-url="https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1926053244477886825?s=46" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;posted to the social platform X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and addressed to the head of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, which had ordered the cull. Kennedy suggested that the ostriches may have already acquired some "downstream immunity" to the virus, and Oz offered to relocate the birds to his Florida ranch for further study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;A close-up of chickens in an industrial farm. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: KARRASTOCK via Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorrel told Live Science that these statements imply "there is still an expectation that those in the Trump administration, at least on the human health side, believe this approach has merit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Sorrel and her report collaborators disagree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allowing widespread infection of commercial flocks would kill billions of birds, drive poultry and egg prices up, as well as destabilize local economies and global trade through import restrictions imposed on U.S. products, the authors wrote. Simultaneously, it could also foster reservoirs of H5N1, increasing the virus' odds of making the leap to humans — and gaining the ability for human-to-human infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rapid culling of [H5N1] positive flocks is central to containment of the virus on a farm," Sorrel said. "Poultry infected with H5 shed a tremendous amount of virus. If effective controls designed to mitigate the quantity of viral shedding and known transmission pathways are removed, the exposure risk for other animals and humans on site and on neighboring farms will increase, and the opportunity for H5 to evolve to be a more effective poultry pathogen increases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy's proposal is also very unlikely to work the way he's claimed it would — the birds that provide eggs and meat on farms are descendants of separate breeding populations and do not breed themselves. So even if there were a population of resilient birds that survived H5N1 infection, that doesn't mean they're passing on their genetic traits to a subsequent generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the mortality rate of H5N1 is extremely high among common poultry, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4897471/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4897471/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reaching 100% in domestic chickens&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-experts-propose-3"&gt;What experts propose&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of letting bird flu tear through farms, the scientists propose that government agencies should enhance surveillance of the virus' spread, along with improving data sharing and outbreak response measures shared between poultry producers, industry members and veterinarians. The USDA should not work alone on these measures, Sorrel said, as "interdisciplinary teams need to have the authority and means by which to activate at the state and federal levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other experts agree with the team's suggestions, although they highlighted areas that need further discussion. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cvm.ncsu.edu/people/rcrespo/" target="_blank" data-url="https://cvm.ncsu.edu/people/rcrespo/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Rocio Crespo&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a poultry veterinarian at the North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine, told Live Science that further details on potential vaccine strategies and biosecurity at farms should be explored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the USDA is now &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/weekly-agriculture/2025/06/02/usda-faces-billions-in-cuts-00379893" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/weekly-agriculture/2025/06/02/usda-faces-billions-in-cuts-00379893" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;facing billions of dollars in federal funding cuts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Crespo says that providing economic support to farmers facing outbreaks — alongside making investments to understand bird flu evolution, preventive measures and control methods — could become increasingly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The current policies on poultry farms are effective at preventing spread to other farms," Crespo told Live Science. "However, the USDA's approach does not consider spill over and influences from other crop or animal agricultural activities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It appears we are continuing with the same strategies without sufficient improvement," she added. "Greater transparency and collaboration is crucial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-8PhJQMYWDteGAz5wNhmXPo-l113IIQWlnLE2kLTvXDxowXfGujOPfWM" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-8PhJQMYWDteGAz5wNhmXPo-l113IIQWlnLE2kLTvXDxowXfGujOPfWM slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Fresh evidence shows that it’s not quite that time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence comes from an eight‑week trial led by exercise scientist &lt;a href="https://www.lehman.edu/academics/health-human-services-nursing/exercise-sciences-recreation/bradley-schoenfeld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brad Schoenfeld&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.lehman.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lehman College&lt;/a&gt;, whose team asked healthy lifters to finish one demanding set of nine classic moves twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-muscle-training-minutes"&gt;Muscle training minutes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A muscle grows when stress outweighs its usual workload, a chain that starts with mechanical tension and metabolic stress, then ends with more contractile proteins. Short sessions that reach high effort check all those boxes, even if the calendar space is small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health agencies already &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tell&lt;/a&gt; adults to hit two days of resistance work, yet fewer than one in four Americans manage the target. Shaving sessions to thirty minutes lowers the barrier without watering down the stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2022 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30153194/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;meta‑analysis&lt;/a&gt; on trained men and women reported that just three weekly thirteen‑minute bouts raised strength almost as much as forty‑minute routines when total effort matched. In other words, quality can beat quantity if each rep counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schoenfeld’s experiment now confirms the principle over a longer eight‑week window and in a mixed‑sex sample. That widens the practical appeal beyond seasoned bodybuilders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells respond to energy shortages created by &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10801605/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;intense contractions&lt;/a&gt; by releasing adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase, a switch that boosts glucose uptake and supports muscle repair. Hitting that threshold does not require marathon workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-study-measured"&gt;What the study measured&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forty‑two volunteers rotated through a lat pull‑down, seated row, shoulder press, chest press, triceps push‑down, supinated curl, Smith‑machine squat, leg press, and leg extension. Each visit lasted thirty minutes including brief warm‑ups and one‑minute rest periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used ultrasound to gauge thickness in the biceps, triceps, and quadriceps before and after the program. Strength, jump height, and endurance were also tested to see whether &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exercise-fuels-neuron-growth-through-muscle-signals/"&gt;muscles&lt;/a&gt; not only grew but performed better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half the group lifted until they could not complete another strict repetition, a strategy known as &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/weight-training-shields-the-aging-brain-from-dementia/"&gt;training&lt;/a&gt; to failure. The other half stopped two reps short, counting repetitions in reserve as a safety buffer for joints and nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our study, the workouts were sufficiently hard to challenge the participants’ muscles beyond their present capacity,” said Schoenfeld. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both muscle training strategies enlarged muscle fibers to a similar degree, supporting earlier &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30558493/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; showing that frequency and intensity make only small differences once weekly volume matches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A follow‑up analysis found that participants improved their ability to guess how many reps they had left, a skill that lets lifters train hard while avoiding form breakdown. That insight could help gym‑goers monitor effort without fancy devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-muscle-training-to-failure-vs-holding-back"&gt;Muscle training to failure vs holding back&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going to failure did provide a slight boost in vertical jump power, hinting that maximum effort might recruit more fast‑twitch fibers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2021 systematic &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33497853/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; echoed that idea but found little extra benefit for arm or leg size when sets finished one or two reps shy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By shortening the recovery time, it drives up metabolic stress,” noted &lt;a href="https://publichealth.buffalo.edu/exercise-and-nutrition-sciences/faculty-and-staff/faculty-directory/lpryor.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Luke Pryor&lt;/a&gt;, clinical associate professor of exercise and nutrition sciences at the &lt;a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University at Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolic by‑products like lactate and hydrogen ions may act as growth signals when they accumulate quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8884877/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; from 2023 concluded that training frequency between one and three times per week yields comparable hypertrophy if the total number of quality sets is constant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means busy professionals can cluster their lifts into two focused sessions and still progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athletes chasing power for sprinting or jumping might sprinkle a third day of explosive work. Recreational lifters, however, can choose the schedule that fits job and family demands without fearing slower results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-muscle-training-for-time-pressed-people"&gt;Muscle training for time‑pressed people&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Select compound patterns such as squats, deadlifts, pushups, rows, and pullups, because they rally multiple joints and force the body to use more weight. Keep rests shorter than two minutes to maintain the thirty‑minute ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I repeat this often: It doesn’t have to be the most to have a benefit,” said &lt;a href="https://sohostrengthlab.com/bios/albert-matheny/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Albert Matheny, RD, CSCS&lt;/a&gt;, co‑founder of &lt;a href="https://sohostrengthlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SoHo Strength Lab&lt;/a&gt;. Starting light lets newcomers learn form while still nudging muscles in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2021.789403/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Evidence&lt;/a&gt; from 2022 shows that even two thirteen‑minute workouts can raise lean mass if they reach a hard effort, an encouraging benchmark for people who dread long sessions. Once technique improves, individuals can add a warm‑up set or increase load to keep progress steady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strength work does more than shape arms. It preserves bone density, raises insulin sensitivity, and helps older adults stay independent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/adding-adults/what-counts.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; lists reduced anxiety, better sleep, and a lower risk of chronic disease among the bonuses of regular resistance training. Those benefits kick in long before a mirror shows new definition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-questions-that-remain"&gt;Questions that remain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The present study used mostly machine &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/resistance-exercise-may-be-the-secret-to-relieving-depression/"&gt;exercises&lt;/a&gt;, which guide motion and reduce stabilizer demand. Future trials will need to confirm whether free‑weight circuits of equal length give the same payoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample averaged twenty‑seven years old and had at least a year of lifting experience. Researchers will test the protocol in beginners and older adults, groups who often struggle to meet activity guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists also want to track hormones like testosterone and growth hormone during such brief workouts, along with markers of satellite cell activation. Those data could explain why some &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-grapes-every-day-can-transform-your-muscles/"&gt;muscles&lt;/a&gt; adapt faster than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the simplest plan stands: warm up, pick nine movements that cover the whole body, perform eight to ten deliberate reps, and close the gym bag after thirty minutes. Consistency beats elaborate programming when the clock is tight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/abstract/9900/without_fail__muscular_adaptations_in_single_set.782.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medicine &amp;amp; Science in Sports &amp;amp; Exercise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 17:25:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPRWZDaURyY2F1eUlFMzFTNVItNWFvdWVHcDV3aGRMWWZuRnQwUFpRbk84bVVOZEZRYnphbkl6Ym45ck5wTWYzRHYyM0Q5NjJ3WkFVNnB3YWZYU3BlMFl4Z3JMeFpTUlphY1d3NTNnbWwtTEo4R2d3cUxzZWhsSDVsMnZ4UGFOU24wRmRxTERLdU5wOVFvSDEyYVJ5dVJhMEhwblhKdGZIRGRUTVJO</guid></item><item><title>吃脑变形虫是罕见的。但炎热的天气会增加风险。-《华盛顿邮报》 | Brain-eating amoebas are rare.

But if you’ve heard reports about a “brain-eating” amoeba that lives in fresh water, you&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;might be questioning&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;how safe it really is to go for that dip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FYO35VHCONAG7HWX2EPWPRVI5Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The amoeba, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2023/07/31/brain-eating-amoeba-symptoms-treatment/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is found around the world in soil and warm fresh water. It can also appear in tap water and less often in swimming pools that haven’t been properly chlorinated. The amoeba hasn’t been detected in salt water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CKWO5YKZORCQ3LV5NZQDOL4KQE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Naegleria fowleri &lt;/i&gt;is&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;a free-living amoeba, which means it doesn’t need a host to survive. “There are lots of free-living amoeba in the environment,” said &lt;a href="https://ctegd.uga.edu/about/directory/dennis-kyle/" target="_blank"&gt;Dennis Kyle&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Center for Tropical &amp;amp; Emerging Global Diseases at the University of Georgia, “but &lt;i&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/i&gt; is one we have to worry about for causing disease in humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4C7HWYUICVHILMXEQ5ZYFSTMHY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Most of the time, humans coexist with &lt;i&gt;Naegleria fowleri &lt;/i&gt;without issue — the amoeba is harmless if swallowed, Kyle said. But if it gets into a person’s nasal passages, the amoeba can become dangerous. From there, &lt;i&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/i&gt; can make its way to the frontal part of the brain, where a fast-acting infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis, or PAM, develops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B4PDQNRKDRC7TG6U3IWEFGNDRY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Of the 164 reported cases in the United States over the past 60 years or so, only four people who developed PAM have made a full recovery. Once it enters the brain, &lt;i&gt;Naegleria fowleri &lt;/i&gt;works quickly&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;consuming brain tissue before many doctors even think to test for the amoeba. “It’s a rapid disease that is often missed in the diagnosis,” Kyle said.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;A person might experience vague symptoms such as headache, fever and nausea, which escalate to brain swelling and coma — and death within a few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SWULTJMW4BH5JC6E2NRKUQUO3U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As scary as this is, it’s important to remember that &lt;i&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/i&gt; infections are very unusual. Fewer than 10 cases are reported in the U.S. each year, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/naegleria/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;(As a comparison, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/07/17/drowning-death-statistics/" target="_blank"&gt;accidental drownings&lt;/a&gt; are responsible for 400 times as many deaths annually, making them a far greater danger when it comes to water safety.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZR7DQU746VGNLPQSTE6MHCU474" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But even though PAM is exceedingly rare, it’s still important&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;to know how to lower your risk, especially if you swim in freshwater lakes or rivers.

Try not to get fresh water in your nose.&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZAXGYEH7XFDHZDUFHFNPACMSJE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/i&gt; flourishes in warm freshwater lakes, rivers and hot springs. But the amoeba becomes harmful only if it manages to travel up the nasal passages. “The best protection is to avoid getting water up your nose,” said &lt;a href="https://www.templehealth.org/doctors/eric-altneu" target="_blank"&gt;Eric Altneu&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious-diseases doctor at the Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="R7H6SZK3MNFU3OIKXVDBE6IHXM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This means the safest strategy — aside from not swimming at all or sticking to salt water — is to “keep your head above water” while you swim, said&lt;a href="https://www.clemson.edu/science/academics/departments/genbio/about/profiles/jmorri2" target="_blank"&gt; James Morris&lt;/a&gt;, a professor in the Department of Genetics and Biochemistry and a founding member of the Eukaryotic Pathogens Innovation Center at Clemson University.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Submerging your head while swimming or participating in aquatic sports that cause water to splash on your face (think wakeboarding, water skiing and whitewater rafting) increase your risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="7M35NA6FYZFURCKPJRBDC247T4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="7M35NA6FYZFURCKPJRBDC247T4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;2. Don’t jump in.&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NE3HDX3Z3NBFPM76NPHRNMT4WY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Not getting your face wet is best,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;though not always realistic. If you do go underwater during a freshwater swim,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;it’s safer not to jump or dive in, experts said.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“That is going to force water up your nose, and it’s that route of entry that we should avoid,” said &lt;a href="https://profiles.unthsc.edu/profile/283" target="_blank"&gt;David Siderovski&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of pharmacology and neuroscience at the University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;To be safe, the CDC recommends holding your nose or using a nose clip when jumping or diving into water that might be harboring &lt;i&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CWLZYDLMKNH4NELHGNM3N4GO2A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Jumping could also help explain why so many PAM infections have occurred in young boys: Some experts, including the CDC, have theorized that this demographic may be more likely to engage in higher-risk activities like jumping and diving when playing in fresh water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="ZEPP7JMJMVBMVMF4L2YBLKA7S4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="ZEPP7JMJMVBMVMF4L2YBLKA7S4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;3. Avoid disturbing the soil.&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CDUSZH7PRVF7RGYB5VQO4XZKDA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;We know &lt;i&gt;Naegleria fowleri &lt;/i&gt;likes to live in freshwater silt and dirt. Disrupting this bottom sediment layer, such as by kicking or digging it up while you swim in shallow water, could allow the amoeba to circulate more freely. “You’re disturbing its resting place,” Siderovski explained. By leaving the sediment alone, “you can cut down on the amount literally in the water.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="X5I5VPVIQRHXPETUONPODKHMDA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="X5I5VPVIQRHXPETUONPODKHMDA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;4. Keep in mind that this amoeba can live in other water sources, too.&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="P6USB4UQ2ZE2ZMY7W7F4LGKAHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Swimmers are most likely to be exposed to &lt;i&gt;Naegleria fowleri &lt;/i&gt;in warm freshwater lakes, rivers and ponds.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;But the amoeba has also been found in swimming pools, canals, water parks, household tap water, sprinklers on a front lawn, even puddles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XIYZQDG6NFGK5ESYCUVRNSRCMQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Swimming pools that weren’t chlorinated properly once&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;caused&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;a greater number of&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Naegleria fowleri &lt;/i&gt;infections,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;but this is less of a risk today. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8739754/" target="_blank"&gt;2022 global review &lt;/a&gt;identified only one infection from a pool since 1987.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Still, “really knowing where you’re swimming and making sure somebody is taking care of the chlorination or the disinfection of the water” is a good idea, Altneu noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X4R2A6PTERDENCCMBUCV43FKIA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Because &lt;i&gt;Naegleria fowleri &lt;/i&gt;has also been found in tap water,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;kiddie pools, splash pads and Slip ’n Slides could accommodate the amoeba. Kyle said he’s been mindful of this when caring for his grandchildren: “We’d fill up their splash pad with fresh water, they would play in it, and I’d dump it out and not let it sit for three or four days,” he said, “because then the soil gets into it, and it has more chance for amoeba to grow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="CVDUWQFLDNALRBQMPWOMLYXUDE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="CVDUWQFLDNALRBQMPWOMLYXUDE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;5. Be extra aware when your risk is highest.&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="D2BQWSFBP5B55EHPE2T5S4YQXA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There are times when the risk is probably heightened. The majority of infections occur during summer or in places with a year-round tropical climate, the 2022 global review found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XINJ3VGF7NCKJH2EG4Q37HTJDY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the U.S., most PAM cases have been reported in southern states.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Climate change is likely to change this, said Siderovski. “We can no longer assume that Texas, California, Florida and Louisiana are the only four states we need to worry about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TKNRPU3RMJFZ3NL27I4EI7LJOA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Unfortunately, there isn’t a specific formula experts can offer in terms of temperature or number of too-warm days before fresh water becomes less safe. This amoeba has been found on every continent except Antarctica, and research has suggested warming waters as a result of climate change means more humans will encounter &lt;i&gt;Naegleria fowleri.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EO2MA322CZD2VE3MWHVEWCKGQQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But in general, “the warmer the water is for a long period of time, the higher chance the amoeba are proliferating more rapidly,” Kyle said. Shallow water can also be risky, since it tends to be warmer and closer to that sediment layer where amoeba thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Z2ARULWZ6VAS3DDIGGPQ3RACHQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If I were going to a lake, I would always assume that the water has &lt;i&gt;Naegleria&lt;/i&gt; in it,” Altneu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="OYKXUUAL5ZAIRKZBK3LE46F3DU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="OYKXUUAL5ZAIRKZBK3LE46F3DU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;6. Use neti pots safely.&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7Y4YQCM7VND7FEFU6V7NS7VA2U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Swimming in fresh water poses the highest risk for &lt;i&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/i&gt;. But a small number of cases have been reported after people used nasal irrigation devices such as &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/04/22/do-neti-pots-work/" target="_blank"&gt;neti pots&lt;/a&gt; or bulb syringes to rinse out their sinuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GXAAYWKPXVC5BEDJFGL4PSFXAM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Nasal irrigation can be an effective way to get relief from symptoms such as sinus pain and congestion. But the water you use always needs to be distilled, sterile or boiled and cooled, since it’s possible to be exposed to &lt;i&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/i&gt; and other germs through unsterile water. Recently, a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7419a4.htm" target="_blank"&gt;71-year-old Texas woman died &lt;/a&gt;of a suspected PAM infection after using a nasal-irrigation device she’d filled with tap water from her RV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2VQQ67GEA5CJLFF3HILUYPKHBU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Safe options include store-bought water that says “distilled” or “sterile” on the label, as well as water from your faucet that you’ve boiled for one minute (three minutes if you live in a high-elevation location, above 6,500 feet) and let cool. “You absolutely should not use tap water” that hasn’t been sterilized to rinse your nose, Morris said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="J3OQTQCXGBCT3DZWA52TIWMV7Q" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="J3OQTQCXGBCT3DZWA52TIWMV7Q" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;The bottom line:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WURL2P7PSVFXFNVNN6YMV2IZ3A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/i&gt; infections are thankfully rare.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;But they’re serious when they do occur, so taking simple precautions can help you and loved ones stay safe.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;And if you or your child develops a headache, fever, nausea or vomiting after swimming in warm fresh water or using a neti pot, seek medical care and tell your doctor about the potential exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NRPFEMJ2M5EDZFCFIGAX27G2FI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It’s something that gets a lot of headlines because of the name, and I think awareness is a very important thing,” said Kyle, “but if, say, you get one drop of water up your nose from your shower, you’re very unlikely to be infected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 17:00:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxOakdsNlY0dS1zMDRvOFhfTkhiclU5aVJ6dkd5VkxyRjIzWTNMVWhyMGg0Zm10c2RTcXh6SFVQRkN0OHlVTFVVbk12bXpRZldaRU1ZTEdIdThoOHIzZUVSODNVME85QkZ4c204LWpodkk3WFlMTV9ZV0R1Q0MzM0p4LTJiRzk</guid></item><item><title>新州报告麻疹爆发为RFK Jr. GUTS疫苗接种-雅虎 | New State Reports Measles Outbreak as RFK Jr. Guts Vaccine Access - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxOSXl3cVBtcDd3UUNxbXhPcHRocVphSUszRkN6OVBieDVSWDNRQTNWZkNGZC1KZDNSQUtwUF9iWkFzLUdYRkx5cnhiVEdVd1Q3R1luTXdJeFdYSjVzcnRudXBXUzlyRjhVYmFwZmRVb1lZZ1lzUEkzSWR0dDN3X1VKbFln?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles is on the rise in Kentucky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Health officials in the state &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chfs.ky.gov/agencies/dph/dehp/idb/Pages/measles.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:confirmed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that the disease has spread to Fayette County, marking the seventh case of the highly contagious illness in Kentucky since the beginning of the year.

One such conspiracist, Secretary of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Health and Human Services &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has refused to combat the ensuing measles outbreak with vetted science—instead, he has issued guidance that the illness can be treated by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/rfk-jr-makes-bonkers-claim-141001818.html" data-ylk="slk:simple vitamins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;simple vitamins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In April, Kennedy fell short of offering a full-throated endorsement of the MMR vaccine that has historically been used to treat measles, telling &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2U0csKvqMY&amp;amp;ab_channel=CBSNews" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CBS News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that his agency was focused on finding treatments for unvaccinated individuals while falsely claiming that the jab had not been “safety tested” and was not effective for long-term prevention. As of 2025, there are no known effective treatments or cures for measles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The return of historically eradicated diseases is thanks to a growing movement of anti-vaxx parents who refuse to provide their children with the same public health advantages that they received in their youth, mostly in fear of thoroughly debunked conspiracy theories. The researcher who &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/2/27/17057990/andrew-wakefield-vaccines-autism-study" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sparked;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;sparked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that myth with a fraudulent paper lost his medical license and eventually rescinded his opinion. Since then, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/do-vaccines-cause-autism" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dozens of studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;dozens of studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; have proven there’s no correlation between autism and vaccines, including one study that surveyed more than 660,000 children over the course of 11 years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But America’s is not the first measles response that Kennedy has bungled. Under Kennedy’s stewardship, the anti-vaxx nonprofit Children’s Health Defense had its own questionable history with the disease. Preceding a deadly measles outbreak on Samoa in 2019, the organization spread rampant misinformation about the efficacy of vaccines throughout the nation, sending the island’s vaccination rate plummeting from the 60 to 70 percent range to just 31 percent, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/how-rfk-jr-falsely-denied-his-connection-to-a-deadly-measles-outbreak-in-samoa/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mother Jones;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. That year, the country reported 5,707 cases of measles as well as 83 measles-related deaths, the majority of which were children under the age of five.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 16:34:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxOSXl3cVBtcDd3UUNxbXhPcHRocVphSUszRkN6OVBieDVSWDNRQTNWZkNGZC1KZDNSQUtwUF9iWkFzLUdYRkx5cnhiVEdVd1Q3R1luTXdJeFdYSjVzcnRudXBXUzlyRjhVYmFwZmRVb1lZZ1lzUEkzSWR0dDN3X1VKbFln</guid></item><item><title>阿拉斯加女性淋病死亡引发对新菌株的恐惧- Gizmodo | Alaskan Woman’s Death From Gonorrhea Sparks Fears of a New Strain - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxQSjA0aGkyMzRvMlkxem1sNGY1S3dsSmJGRkk1bGxnNV9NSVF6dXExaXJXTzlkWlU4X1dFdWRWYkROelNIM1RXZUQ0YjNGUGdEeHNpQW9BQkFxTFNsOHVXOHpNVVdJYk5tNzhYME1FR2xTbkRRVlJtUGU1SDlJSVhXU3VScmo5WjI1aFhCWDI3M2ZIQlh4MkVPYk1MUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;A well-known sexually transmitted infection might be causing more trouble than usual in Alaska. Local health officials this week have reported the death of a woman in her 50s from a rare complication of gonorrhea that’s becoming increasingly more common in the state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Monday, the Alaska Department of Health &lt;a href="https://epi.alaska.gov/bulletins/docs/b2025_13.pdf"&gt;detailed&lt;/a&gt; the tragic death in its latest epidemiology bulletin. The woman died from an untreated gonorrhea infection that had spread widely throughout her body. Health officials are worried that novel strains of the bacteria may be behind a spike of similar cases reported in the area over the past three years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gonorrhea is caused by the bacteria &lt;em&gt;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s one of the most commonly reported STIs worldwide. In 2023, there were &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti-statistics/annual/summary.html"&gt;over 600,000&lt;/a&gt; documented cases of gonorrhea in the U.S. alone. Common symptoms include puke-colored genital discharge and bloody urination, as well as swollen testicles in men and bleeding between periods for women. One reason why gonorrhea is dangerous, however, is that it often doesn’t cause symptoms at all. And when it goes unnoticed and untreated, it can potentially trigger infertility and raise the risk of catching other STIs. If it’s passed down from mother to child in the womb, the infection can also cause severe complications like blindness in the newborn.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seldomly, the bacteria migrate away from where they normally infect us (the genitals and sometimes the throat) to other parts of the body. This complication is called a &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Disseminated-Gonococcal-Infection.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;disseminated gonococcal infection&lt;/a&gt;, or DGI. DGIs can cause varying health problems, depending on where the bacteria end up, such as arthritis or skin lesions. On very rare occasions, the infection can turn lethal if it reaches vital areas like the heart or bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this particular case, the woman visited a local emergency room in Anchorage earlier this spring with symptoms of respiratory distress. She was diagnosed with septic shock and heart failure caused by endocarditis (an inflammation of the inner lining of our heart’s valves and chambers). Tests confirmed the widespread presence of gonorrhea bacteria in her body and bloodstream. Soon after, she succumbed to her infection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While DGI is rare, and deaths from it even rarer, something strange appears to be happening in Alaska as of late. Since 2023, there’s been a &lt;a href="https://epi.alaska.gov/bulletins/docs/b2025_07.pdf"&gt;marked increase&lt;/a&gt; in reported DGI cases. In 2024, there were 24 documented cases—three times higher than the tally reported in 2023 (eight cases) and ten times higher than 2022 (two cases). So far in 2025, there have been eight reported cases of DGI, still well above the typical average in Alaska and the U.S. as a whole.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In many of these cases, including the latest one, people experienced no or few symptoms of their gonorrhea prior to their DGI. They also often had no clear risk factors for an STI and sometimes even tested negative on standard urine and genital swab tests for gonorrhea. Though officials haven’t identified a specific link or chain of transmission between these cases, they suspect that emerging strains of gonorrhea could be causing the local rise in DGI. These strains might be more likely to cause DGI in general, or they might be less likely to cause initial symptoms, allowing infections to go untreated at a higher rate than typical.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though there are still many questions to be answered, health officials are warning residents to be especially proactive about their sexual health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“People in the Anchorage area with a new sexual partner, more than one sexual partner, or a partner with multiple partners might be at risk of acquiring a strain of &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt; thought to carry a higher risk of causing DGI,” the health department stated in its bulletin. Officials are recommending that people with these risk factors get regularly tested for gonorrhea every three to six months.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This isn’t the only recent new trick that gonorrhea has gotten up its sleeve. Other strains of the bacteria have increasingly evolved resistance to the last remaining frontline drugs available against it. These cases of super gonorrhea, while still rare, are spreading as well. Just last month, researchers &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/7/25-0023_article"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; the first such case discovered in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Patients with cancer who participated in a structured exercise program in a randomized-controlled trial lived longer without cancer recurrence and had a lower risk of dying within the trial period compared with people in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I was curious why and how exercise reduces cancer risk, and what everyone should know about incorporating exercise programs in their lives. To find out, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Why are the results of this study so important?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Previous research suggested that exercise could be beneficial for cancer survivors, but this is the first randomized trial that demonstrates exercise after cancer treatment can reduce recurrence and improve survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers recruited nearly 900 patients from 55 cancer centers across six countries who had been treated for either stage III or high-risk stage II colon cancer. Even after cancer treatments such as surgery followed by chemotherapy, colon cancer comes back in an &lt;a href="https://www.asco.org/about-asco/press-center/news-releases/movement-medicine-structured-exercise-program-challenge" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:estimated 30%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;estimated 30%&lt;/a&gt; of patients, according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Many patients with recurrence of their colon cancer end up dying from their disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The patients in the new study were randomized to two groups. The control group received standard health education materials promoting healthy eating and physical activity. This is the current standard-of-care that is provided to patients in remission from their cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The other group participated in a structured exercise program that involved working with a health coach for physical activity guidance and supervised exercise sessions. During the initial six months, patients had twice-a-month coaching sessions. After that period, they met with coaches once a month, with extra sessions available if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Participants randomized to the structured exercise group had significantly higher improvements in physical function as measured by distance they could walk in six minutes and predicted &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-is-vo2-max-and-how-to-calculate-it" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:VO2 max;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;VO2 max&lt;/a&gt; (your oxygen uptake), both indicators of cardiovascular fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The two groups were followed for an average of about eight years. During this period, 131 patients in the control group had recurrence of their cancer, compared with 93 in the structured exercise group. In the control group, 66 people died, compared with 41 in the structured exercise group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People in the structured exercise group had a 28% lower risk of developing recurrent or new cancers compared with those who followed standard-of-care protocols. Members of the exercise group also had a 37% lower risk of death in the trial period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This study is important because its rigorous methodology confirms what previous research had suggested: Exercise extends disease-free survival for patients with cancer and should be incorporated as part of holistic treatment for patients to reduce their risk of recurrent and new cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: How might results of the study change treatment for patients with cancer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Imagine if there were a clinical trial for a new drug that found it lowered the risk of developing recurrent or new cancers by 28% and lowered the risk of death in the trial period by 37%. Patients and doctors would hail this as a tremendous development and would be eager to try this new therapeutic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That’s the magnitude of the findings in this study. I believe they have the potential to substantially change cancer treatment protocols. Currently, after patients receive treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, they are given advice to exercise, but many probably do not engage the services of a health coach or trainer. Their oncologists and primary care doctors may not be asking about their physical activity regimen during follow-up care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I hope this will change, in view of these results. Patients can be counseled to have an “exercise prescription,” and health care providers can follow up to track their exercise activity. Perhaps insurance companies could even consider reimbursement for a health coach for patients with cancer; this could be seen as an investment to reduce the need for costlier chemotherapy and other treatments down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: Why and how does exercise reduce cancer risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Population studies have &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/latest-news/how-exercise-can-lower-cancer-risk.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:long shown;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;long shown&lt;/a&gt; that regular physical activity is associated with lower risks of developing certain cancers. There are &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/obesity/physical-activity-fact-sheet#how-might-physical-activity-be-linked-to-reduced-risks-of-cancer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:several theories;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;several theories&lt;/a&gt; as to why this is the case. One is that physical activity helps people stay at a healthy weight, which is notable because obesity is a risk factor for developing some cancers. In addition, exercise is thought to help regulate some hormones that are implicated in cancer development and to reduce inflammatory response that could also be involved in cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: How much exercise do people need?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends&lt;/a&gt; that adults participate in at least 150 minutes of moderate to high-intensity exercise per week. For someone who is exercising five times a week, that’s about 30 minutes at a time of exercises such as a brisk walk or jog, riding a bike or swimming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The benefits of these exercise minutes are cumulative, meaning that individuals don’t need to do them all at once to have an effect. People who are unable to commit a period of time to exercise could consider how they could incorporate physical activity into their daily routines. Could they take the stairs instead of the elevator at work? If they do this five times a day, that could be as many as 10 minutes of exercise. Could they take a 10-minute phone meeting while walking in their neighborhood instead of sitting at a desk? Could they park a bit farther away to get in a few more minutes of physical activity? Small changes add up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: What other advice do you have for people who want to begin exercise programs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Many studies show that while it’s ideal to get the recommended 150 minutes a week of exercise, there is a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/28/health/moderate-physical-activity-cancer-death-risk-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:significant benefit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;significant benefit&lt;/a&gt; from even a small amount of physical activity. The best advice I can offer is to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good — start with what you can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For instance, consider the idea of “exercise snacks,” or bursts of activity that could be as short in duration as 15 or 30 seconds. These are as simple as doing a few squats or performing household chores. Getting up from your chair and just moving around helps, which is especially important for desk-bound workers who &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/health/effects-of-sitting-on-mortality-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:need additional exercise;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;need additional exercise&lt;/a&gt; to counter the negative health impacts of sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sign up for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/newsletters/fitness-life-but-better?source=nl-acq_article" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

            We all know that regular exercise has many benefits, including reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m200043b6mbil13p1p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Exercise also improves outcomes in patients with cancer, according to a new study published in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2502760" target="_blank"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. Patients with cancer who participated in a structured exercise program in a randomized-controlled trial lived longer without cancer recurrence and had a lower risk of dying within the trial period compared with people in the control group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m200053b6mhrqi7c61@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I was curious why and how exercise reduces cancer risk, and what everyone should know about incorporating exercise programs in their lives. To find out, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m200073b6m6kz7tf9u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Why are the results of this study so important?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m200083b6mf61ts82t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Previous research suggested that exercise could be beneficial for cancer survivors, but this is the first randomized trial that demonstrates exercise after cancer treatment can reduce recurrence and improve survival.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m200093b6mgef4cjd9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers recruited nearly 900 patients from 55 cancer centers across six countries who had been treated for either stage III or high-risk stage II colon cancer. Even after cancer treatments such as surgery followed by chemotherapy, colon cancer comes back in an &lt;a href="https://www.asco.org/about-asco/press-center/news-releases/movement-medicine-structured-exercise-program-challenge" target="_blank"&gt;estimated 30%&lt;/a&gt; of patients, according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Many&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;patients with recurrence of their colon cancer end up dying from their disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m2000a3b6mfxpae85w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The patients in the new study were randomized to two groups. The control group received standard health education materials promoting healthy eating and physical activity. This is the current standard-of-care that is provided to patients in remission from their cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m2000b3b6m1w43pjo4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The other group participated in a structured exercise program that involved working with a health coach for physical activity guidance and supervised exercise sessions. During the initial six months, patients had twice-a-month coaching sessions. After that period, they met with coaches once a month, with extra sessions available if needed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m2000c3b6mxro3mzdk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Participants randomized to the structured exercise group had significantly higher improvements in physical function as measured by distance they could walk in six minutes and predicted &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-is-vo2-max-and-how-to-calculate-it" target="_blank"&gt;VO2 max&lt;/a&gt; (your oxygen uptake), both indicators of cardiovascular fitness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m2000d3b6m29qoct68@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The two groups were followed for an average of about eight years. During this period, 131 patients in the control group had recurrence of their cancer, compared with 93 in the structured exercise group. In the control group, 66 people died, compared with 41 in the structured exercise group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmgmjlf00023b6m6vc1x0zg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People in the structured exercise group had a 28% lower risk of developing recurrent or new cancers compared with those who followed standard-of-care protocols. Members of the exercise group also had a 37% lower risk of death in the trial period.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m2000e3b6mu3yin9t2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This study is important because its rigorous methodology confirms what previous research had suggested: Exercise extends disease-free survival for patients with cancer and should be incorporated as part of holistic treatment for patients to reduce their risk of recurrent and new cancers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m2000f3b6mt6ixi8rt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How might results of the study change treatment for patients with cancer?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m2000g3b6m62d181hk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Imagine if there were a clinical trial for a new drug that found it lowered the risk of developing recurrent or new cancers by 28% and lowered the risk of death in the trial period by 37%. Patients and doctors would hail this as a tremendous development and would be eager to try this new therapeutic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m2000h3b6mkazkhjsu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s the magnitude of the findings in this study. I believe they have the potential to substantially change cancer treatment protocols. Currently, after patients receive treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, they are given advice to exercise, but many probably do not engage the services of a health coach or trainer. Their oncologists and primary care doctors may not be asking about their physical activity regimen during follow-up care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m2000i3b6mlv7qf321@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I hope this will change, in view of these results. Patients can be counseled to have an “exercise prescription,” and health care providers can follow up to track their exercise activity. Perhaps insurance companies could even consider reimbursement for a health coach for patients with cancer; this could be seen as an investment to reduce the need for costlier chemotherapy and other treatments down the line.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Population studies have &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/latest-news/how-exercise-can-lower-cancer-risk.html" target="_blank"&gt;long shown&lt;/a&gt; that regular physical activity is associated with lower risks of developing certain cancers. There are &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/obesity/physical-activity-fact-sheet#how-might-physical-activity-be-linked-to-reduced-risks-of-cancer" target="_blank"&gt;several theories&lt;/a&gt; as to why this is the case. One is that physical activity helps people stay at a healthy weight, which is notable because obesity is a risk factor for developing some cancers. In addition, exercise is thought to help regulate some hormones that are implicated in cancer development and to reduce inflammatory response that could also be involved in cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m2000l3b6melliq8g0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends&lt;/a&gt; that adults participate in at least 150 minutes of moderate to high-intensity exercise per week. For someone who is exercising five times a week, that’s about 30 minutes at a time of exercises such as a brisk walk or jog, riding a bike or swimming.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m2000n3b6m8h5zrtkn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The benefits of these exercise minutes are cumulative, meaning that individuals don’t need to do them all at once to have an effect. People who are unable to commit a period of time to exercise could consider how they could incorporate physical activity into their daily routines. Could they take the stairs instead of the elevator at work? If they do this five times a day, that could be as many as 10 minutes of exercise. Could they take a 10-minute phone meeting while walking in their neighborhood instead of sitting at a desk? Could they park a bit farther away to get in a few more minutes of physical activity? Small changes add up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Many studies show that while it’s ideal to get the recommended 150 minutes a week of exercise, there is a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/28/health/moderate-physical-activity-cancer-death-risk-wellness/index.html"&gt;significant benefit&lt;/a&gt; from even a small amount of physical activity. The best advice I can offer is to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good — start with what you can.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbn1m2000q3b6mbsmrzmcw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For instance, consider the idea of “exercise snacks,” or bursts of activity that could be as short in duration as 15 or 30 seconds. These are as simple as doing a few squats or performing household chores. Getting up from your chair and just moving around helps, which is especially important for desk-bound workers who &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/health/effects-of-sitting-on-mortality-wellness"&gt;need additional exercise&lt;/a&gt; to counter the negative health impacts of sitting.

&lt;p&gt;X-rays of the ankle showed swelling in the soft tissue but without some signs of infection. The doctors wondered if the man had osteomyelitis, an infection in the bone, which can be a complication in people with diabetic ulcers. The large size and duration of the ulcer matched with a bone infection, as well as some elevated inflammatory markers he had on his blood tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate the bone infection further, they admitted the man to the hospital and ordered magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). But the MRI showed only a soft-tissue defect and a normal bone, ruling out a bone infection. Another MRI was done with a contrast agent. That showed that the man's large arteries were normal and there were no large blood clots deep in his veins—which is sometimes linked to prolonged standing, as the man did at his laundromat job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the doctors were still working to root out the cause, they had started him on a heavy-duty regimen of antibiotics. This was done with the assumption that on top of whatever caused the ulcer, there was now also a potentially aggressive secondary infection—one not knocked out by the previous round of antibiotics the man had been given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a bunch of diagnostic dead ends piling up, the doctors broadened their view of possibilities, newly considering cancers, rare inflammatory conditions, and less common conditions affecting small blood vessels (as the MRI has shown the larger vessels were normal). This led them to the possibility of a Martorell's ulcer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These ulcers, first described in 1945 by a Spanish doctor named Fernando Martorell, form when prolonged, uncontrolled high blood pressure causes the teeny arteries below the skin to stiffen and narrow, which blocks the blood supply, leading to tissue death and then ulcers. The ulcers in these cases tend to start as red blisters and evolve to frank ulcers. They are excruciatingly painful. And they tend to form on the lower legs, often over the Achilles’ tendon, though it's unclear why this location is common.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Australian man has died after becoming just the fourth known person to contract an extremely rare, bat-borne virus. Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV)—unique to Australia, where it was first identified in 1996—is closely related to rabies and can cause fatal disease once symptoms appear. Early signs are similar to the flu, including headache, fever, and fatigue, with rapid progression to paralysis and death. Immediate post-exposure treatment with rabies immunoglobulin and vaccines can prevent the illness from developing, but there is no effective treatment once symptoms set in, per the &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/australian-man-dies-from-extremely-rare-virus-after-bat-bit/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This can take days or years. All other known human cases were fatal, per &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/man-dies-bat-bite-extremely-rare-infection-australia/"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        The man in his 50s was bitten by a bat several months ago. He reportedly sought treatment, "though it is not clear how quickly," per the &lt;em&gt;Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;. He was reported to be in critical condition this week before his ultimate death, per CBS. Bats can transfer the virus through bites or scratches. Wildlife Health Australia reports that, as of June 2024, 420 bats in the country have tested positive for ABLV since 2001, but the actual prevalence among wild bat populations remains unclear. Experts highlight the risks increase when bats enter populated areas in search of food or during extreme heat events. Authorities urge anyone bitten or scratched by a bat to seek prompt medical care.

			&lt;p&gt;Weird dreams and vivid nightmares &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2005/09/16/4851485/study-eating-cheese-can-alter-your-dreams"&gt;following late-night consumption&lt;/a&gt; of cheese products are surprisingly common complaints, but scientific evidence linking the two has been lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study investigating the relationships between food, sleep, and dreams confirms a number of foods you eat before bed may indeed have a very real impact on the night ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dream neuroscientist Tore Nielsen of the University of Montreal, who led the study, is often asked whether food affects dreaming, and has &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00047"&gt;published research on the topic before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, he and his team recruited 1,082 psychology students from Canadian MacEwan University to undertake an online survey that probed their food habits, sleep time and quality, dreams, and nightmares. It also assessed their perception of how certain kinds of food, and time of eating, impacted their sleep and dreams, if at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cheese-makes-you-happy-and-could-boost-healthy-aging-study-suggests?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Cheese Makes You Happy And Could Boost Healthy Aging, Study Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These new findings imply that changing eating habits for people with some food sensitivities could alleviate nightmares. They could also explain why people so often blame dairy for bad dreams," &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2025/07/01/cheese-may-really-be-giving-you-nightmares-scientists-find-frontiers-psychology"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Nielsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 5.5 percent of respondents believed the type of food being eaten and the timing of its consumption before sleep affected their dreams, but most people in this group blamed either dairy or sweet foods for changes. This was especially true of disturbing or bizarre dreams: 31 percent blamed these on desserts or sweets, while 22 percent blamed dairy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found a strong association between lactose intolerances and food allergies and nightmares and poor sleep, perhaps because gas and stomach pains interrupted sleep in ways that increased the chances of experiencing and recalling dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that treating food intolerances and allergies with dietary changes may improve people's sleep, as well as their gastrointestinal comfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166392" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166392" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-01-at-5.07.57%E2%80%AFpm.png" alt="bar graph shows nightmare disorder index for presence and absence of sensitive foods among people with food allergies, gluten intolerance and lactose intolerance" class="size-full wp-image-166392" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-01-at-5.07.57 pm.png 1836w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-01-at-5.07.57 pm-642x281.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-01-at-5.07.57 pm-948x415.png 948w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-01-at-5.07.57 pm-768x336.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-01-at-5.07.57 pm-1536x673.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-01-at-5.07.57 pm-600x263.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1836px) 100vw, 1836px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166392" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;People who consumed the food they are allergic to, or the lactose they are intolerant of, scored higher on the nightmare disorder index. (Nielsen et al., &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nightmares are worse for lactose-intolerant people who suffer severe gastrointestinal symptoms and whose sleep is disrupted," &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2025/07/01/cheese-may-really-be-giving-you-nightmares-scientists-find-frontiers-psychology"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Nielsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This makes sense, because we know that other bodily sensations can affect dreaming. Nightmares can be very disruptive, especially if they occur often, because they tend to awaken people from sleep in a dysphoric state. They might also produce sleep avoidance behaviors. Both symptoms can rob you of restful sleep."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that people who eat healthier (better food, more intuitive eating, and less food in the evening) report better dream recall, while people who ate less healthily (more junk food, less reliance on hunger and satiety, eating more food in the evening) tended to have more severe nightmares, or dreams with a more negative tone, and (perhaps thankfully) lower dream recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the study is based on self-reported data from university students, it's not necessarily representative of the broader population. And it can only tell us about people's perception of the relationship between food and dreams, not the actual mechanisms that could cause such a phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to study more people of different ages, from different walks of life, and with different dietary habits to determine if our results are truly generalizable to the larger population," Nielsen &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2025/07/01/cheese-may-really-be-giving-you-nightmares-scientists-find-frontiers-psychology"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Experimental studies are also needed to determine if people can truly detect the effects of specific foods on dreams. We would like to run a study in which we ask people to ingest cheese products versus some control food before sleep to see if this alters their sleep or dreams."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're sure it won't be difficult to find volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1544475"&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p id="ATD_INR1" class="ad-slot gpt-ad-middle gpt-ad-middle-article gpt-ad-middle-1 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;When I started estrogen, I knew my &lt;a href="https://www.autostraddle.com/how-can-trans-women-deal-with-erectile-dysfunction/"&gt;penis would flounder&lt;/a&gt; and I’d grow breasts (awesome!). Every community of trans women within reach was replete with discussions about the usual suspects: breast development; fat redistribution; reduced body hair growth. These are well-known effects of feminizing hormone replacement therapy (HRT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What surprises me is just how much other stuff is managed by primary sex hormones. The EPA (bless their hearts under this administration) notes that there &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/endocrine-disruption/overview-endocrine-system"&gt;are over 50 hormones&lt;/a&gt; in humans. Most of them serve a regulatory purpose. Some of them are &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23005-adrenal-gland"&gt;necessary for life&lt;/a&gt;. Estrogen and its manly counterpart are only two of those, but their overabundance or deficiency can change the entire experience of living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here’s my &lt;em&gt;I Lived It&lt;/em&gt; story about unexpected things that happened to me (and others) who started feminizing HRT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. I’m so much cooler these days&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Literally and figuratively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s this physiological quirk where on average, men work more comfortably &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-71819-0_9"&gt;in cooler temperatures than women&lt;/a&gt; and cis women are sometimes shown to be more &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36585080/"&gt;sensitive to temperature changes&lt;/a&gt; than cis men. &lt;a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5967812/v1"&gt;Recent research&lt;/a&gt; has extended this temperature sensitivity to trans women on feminizing HRT. And what does this research prove? That my feet are cold. Although I already knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As estrogen took effect, my experience of temperature changed. I run cooler than I used to. I get cold more easily, and need more layers to feel comfortable. Most importantly, I can handle heat better than I used to. Despite naming myself Summer, I used to hate the warm half of the year. I now find heat tolerable, although &lt;a href="https://www.autostraddle.com/disability-justice-climate-justice/"&gt;humanity’s collective efforts&lt;/a&gt; push my limits every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between sex hormones and temperature is wild. People have argued that office &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/28/nyregion/office-temperature-sexist-nixon-cuomo.html"&gt;air conditioning is sexist&lt;/a&gt; due to its discomforting effect on women. Menopausal hot flashes are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6459071/"&gt;strongly associated&lt;/a&gt; with a decline in estrogen production. There’s even a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937821011212"&gt;hypothesis that clothing habits&lt;/a&gt; of trans women like tucking may increase scrotal temperatures, which reduces our sperm quality. Hilarious, since nothing kills our sperm faster than estrogen in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, there isn’t enough research on this topic to establish a scientific consensus. Much of it is anecdotal. What I can say for myself is that I love cool environments. I have nerve damage that impairs sweat production, so I overheat faster than almost anyone. Estrogen made my body run cooler to counteract the nerve damage and I finally feel normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. My veins don’t pop as much&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one was circulating (heh) on Reddit early in my transition. The prospect excited me. Visible vascularity is the veininess you see under the skin. Some of it criss-crosses directly under the surface. It’s especially visible in high blood flow areas like the feet or on flexed muscles. The latter part explains its association with &lt;a href="https://www.autostraddle.com/bev-francis-interview/"&gt;fitness and bodybuilding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The association of vascularity with &lt;em&gt;muscularity&lt;/em&gt; and strength ran counter to my personal transition goals. I’m preoccupied with daintiness to a fault. The prominent veins cutting across my forearm and shin were a bug, not a feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estrogen addressed that. My veins are much less visible than they used to be and it comforts that soft spot in my self-esteem. My thinking brain knows that all bodies have veins and they all look different, but it’s hard to shake some of the self-talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a more informed take, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/anaphylaxus/"&gt;Dr. Anastacia Tomson&lt;/a&gt; (general physician, activist, and fellow estronaut) says, “Lower body temperatures result in less vasodilation (that is to say, the blood vessels under the surface of the skin do not expand as much as they would under testosterone).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Peeing yourself a little bit. Forever&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within months of my first dose, I saw a reduction in muscle mass. Expected. I also started &lt;a href="https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-022-01742-w"&gt;peeing myself a tiny bit&lt;/a&gt; after every trip to the bathroom. &lt;em&gt;Every single one.&lt;/em&gt; Less expected. The standard twist-and-shake was no longer sufficient. I wrang my penis for a few more drops. I worked my kegel muscles. I started wiping and leaning forward to get gravity in on the action. Once satisfied, I’d get my clothes back on, wash up, and leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then pee myself a bit as soon as I sat down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Tomson’s fancy word version is that, “Estrogen can cause changes to skeletal muscle in terms of mass and strength, and this includes the muscles of the pelvic floor, which could lead to certain kinds of incontinence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s very unfortunate for my thirty year-old ass because &lt;em&gt;incontinence&lt;/em&gt; is a word I associate with people who are much younger, older, or unluckier than me. Sadly, my girlfriend, our girl bestie, and an assortment of women in my life &lt;a href="https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-022-01742-w"&gt;have verified this&lt;/a&gt;. They &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; pee themselves a bit after we think we’re done. I just arrived late to the party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Dying but in a girlypop way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hormones are intimately linked to disease risk. I mean, &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/endocrine-system-disorders"&gt;numerous conditions&lt;/a&gt; just happen because of hormone imbalances. Most of them make life awful. Some of them make life awful, then kill you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides all the other stuff, primary sex hormones can alter a person’s risk profile for various diseases. Early research suggests that trans women on estrogen and anti-androgens have a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7379905/"&gt;five times lower prostate cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;. This coincides with the use of antiandrogens to &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/prostate/prostate-hormone-therapy-fact-sheet"&gt;inhibit prostate cancer in cis men&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estrogen gave me breasts, but my girlfriend gave me a crash course on the self breast exam. Because guess what? Having breasts significantly increases the risk of breast cancer. &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/365/bmj.l1652"&gt;Including for trans women&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking estrogen orally (usually via a pill) is also &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK593552/"&gt;loosely linked&lt;/a&gt; to an increased risk of cardiovascular illness in trans women. But this &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; negative side effect doesn’t amount to a meaningful argument against feminizing HRT. All HRT, anti-androgens, and puberty-blockers have long histories of use in cisgender populations and their application to trans bodies is merely a matter of equal access to healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research seems to mirror Dr. Tomson’s best guess about risk profiles, which was, “Overall cardiovascular risk decreases, and we expect (but have not proven) that prostate cancer risk will also drop. The risk of developing blood clots may increase with certain forms of feminising HRT, and ostensibly the risk of breast cancer can increase too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started estrogen, my informed consent documentation highlighted these risks. I signed off anyway. In hindsight, one of my strangest sources of gender affirmation has been knowing that I’m &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more likely to die ‘like a woman’. That’s comforting… I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hormones: One cause of, and solution to, all of life’s problems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sourced list doesn’t cover half of it. Some notable runners-up included feminizing HRT’s ability to &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ced/article/48/10/1117/7197278"&gt;halt or reverse androgenic balding&lt;/a&gt;, scattered reports of sharper vision and smell, and reduced acne. Every study I found championed the need for more research into transgender endocrine health because it would improve healthcare delivery and reduce risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my life, I’ve joined my cis girlfriend and girl friends in attributing the numerous physiological ills and gains to hormonal fluctuations. The more I read into the workings, the more I realize that I can blame anything that goes wrong in my body on sex hormones and have a decent shot at being right about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I’ve yet to find an explanation for people’s growing desire to hurl objects at &lt;a href="https://www.autostraddle.com/supreme-court-upholds-tennesee-law-on-trans-healthcare-in-skrmetti/"&gt;Supreme Court buildings&lt;/a&gt; after major rulings that prohibit medical equity. Further data is required to establish a meaningful consensus on this phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Am I human, or am I bacteria?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question sounds like something out of &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;, but it popped into my head around chapter four of &lt;a href="https://theexperimentpublishing.com/catalogs/summer-2025/the-microbiome-master-key/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Microbiome Master Key&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and I couldn’t shake it. Written by Brett Finlay and Jessica Finlay — yes, they’re a related father–daughter scientist duo — the book explores how the microbes living in and on us shape nearly every aspect of human health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Microbes,” short for microorganisms, are tiny living things like bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. When scientists talk about the human microbiome, they usually refer to the trillions of bacteria that live in and on our bodies, especially in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many people, I had a vague sense that gut bacteria help with digestion. I eat yogurt and drink the occasional kombucha partly because I assume it’s “good for my gut.” I even knew the classic fun fact: By sheer number of cells and DNA, we’re more microbial than human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the Finlays’ book challenged my assumption that my microbiome was made up of mostly passive passengers. Instead, the authors show that it is essential to almost every part of how we function: healing, sleeping, how our skin looks, and maybe even how we think. The connection made me reconsider, well … what actually “am” I?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview, I asked Brett if studying the microbiome made him question things like free will, agency, or identity. He chuckled the way a scholar does when someone new to their field finally has that “Aha!” moment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Learning more about your microbiome will certainly shake your definition of what it means to be human,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A microbiologist and professor at the University of British Columbia, Brett has spent decades immersed in the world of bacteria. In his classes, he tells students to look around the room and describe what they see. “Where they say ‘human,’ I say, ‘Yes, a human, but also a vessel for bacteria.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jessica, a geographer, environmental gerontologist, and assistant professor at the University of Colorado Boulder, brought a more relational view. She described microbes as her “lifelong invisible partners.” “We give them a home and food,” she said. “In return, they help us function. They’re with us from birth to death. You don’t really get to opt out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While that thought might elicit cringes from some readers, the reality is far from a germophobic nightmare. That’s because embracing your microbiome may be, as the authors put it, the real “master key” to better health and aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-amazon wp-block-embed-amazon"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rewriting-the-microbial-story"&gt;Rewriting the microbial story&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This perspective motivated the Finlays to update their 2019 book, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Whole-Body-Microbiome-Harness-Microbes_Inside-Lifelong/dp/1615194819"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Whole Body Microbiome&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and expand it with new chapters and fresh research in &lt;em&gt;The Microbiome Master Key&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Really, this is the book we wanted to write five years ago,” Brett tells me. “Back then, we had hints that microbes weren’t just important in the gut but critical to many functions. The research wasn’t strong enough to make a compelling case, though.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, it is, and the Finlays have pulled together the evidence linking the microbiome to a wide-ranging — and, frankly, almost unbelievable — list of health outcomes: from chronic inflammation to cognitive decline, from depression to physical fitness, from better sleep to more youthful skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond sharing the new research, the Finlays were also motivated to update the book because they felt we may be on the edge of a mindset shift — one that could influence whether we, collectively, choose to embrace our microbes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning more about your microbiome will certainly shake your definition of what it means to be human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Brett Finlay&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve spent the last 120 years trying to kill bacteria so we don’t die from infectious diseases,” Brett explains. Over time and alongside revolutions in medicine, hygiene, and sanitation, germs became public enemy number one. But more recently, people have started to embrace the idea of the gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were moving in a good direction when the public was embracing the importance of the gut microbiome,” Jessica adds. “People were encouraging kids to play in the dirt, backing off hand sanitizer a bit, eating fermented foods to support their microbiome. Then COVID hit, and understandably, people became terrified of germs again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Finlays aren’t against fighting infectious diseases or practicing good hygiene, of course. They simply argue that our post-pandemic recoil into extreme cleanliness risks disrupting the delicate microbial ecosystems our bodies depend on to thrive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gut-check-the-microbiome-s-central-hub"&gt;Gut check: The microbiome’s central hub&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human gut is home to an astonishingly diverse and abundant community of microbes, estimated at over &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4191858/"&gt;100 trillion bacte&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4191858/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4191858/"&gt;ia&lt;/a&gt;. That’s roughly equivalent to the number of human cells in the body. Among these are hundreds of unique species, many of which live in the colon and large intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We pick up most of our gut bacteria early on, starting with a major dose during the journey through the birth canal. From there, the microbiome tends to stabilize through adulthood as we’re exposed to microbes in our environment and from the people around us. Interestingly, it begins to shift again as we age. People over 65 often show a different balance of key bacterial groups and tend to have more microbes associated with inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you study the microbiomes of people with many of the world’s most pressing conditions,  you’ll find a microbial signature associated with them,” said Brett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, many conditions — such as obesity, cancer, liver disease, heart disease, and neurodegenerative disorders — are associated with a shift in the microbiome. Certain microbial species may be present or missing; imbalances in microbial function may have occurred. Researchers are still working to determine whether these patterns play a role in causing disease or are associated with it. Still, one thing is clear: The pattern emerges again and again across a wide range of diseases and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early in my reading, I wondered: What causes the microbiome to shift away from a community that supports health? A major culprit is diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods — anything from Pop-Tarts to protein powder — are called “ultra-processed” for a reason. They’re so refined that your body can break them down and absorb them early in the digestive tract, so they never reach the large intestine where many beneficial microbes live. As a result, those microbes are essentially starved of the complex fibers they rely on to survive and thrive. In Western countries like the United States, ultra-processed foods now make up a growing portion of the typical diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antibiotics are another disruptor unique to modern life. While lifesaving in many cases, antibiotics don’t discriminate: They wipe out harmful pathogens and beneficial gut bacteria alike. In the book, the Finlays note studies that detected changes to the microbiome up to four years after a single course of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the obsession with cleanliness. Our environments are increasingly sanitized, and while that helps prevent infections, it also limits our exposure to the diverse microbes our guts evolved alongside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add up these habits and stressors, and over time, your gut begins to support a different kind of microbiome, one that may include harmful species. And, as the Finlays argue, a changing microbiome can have systemic effects on physical and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wild_garden_of_the_gut_bacteria_6.jpg?w=6016" alt="A petri dish with a white agar surface displaying a blue and purple floral pattern and two small round discs." class="wp-image-573587" sizes="auto, (max-width: 767px) 96vw, (max-width: 1280px) 60vw, (max-width: 1536px) 46vw, 710px" srcset="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wild_garden_of_the_gut_bacteria_6.jpg 6016w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wild_garden_of_the_gut_bacteria_6.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wild_garden_of_the_gut_bacteria_6.jpg?resize=2048,1367 2048w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wild_garden_of_the_gut_bacteria_6.jpg?resize=20,12 20w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wild_garden_of_the_gut_bacteria_6.jpg?resize=375,250 375w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wild_garden_of_the_gut_bacteria_6.jpg?resize=640,427 640w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wild_garden_of_the_gut_bacteria_6.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wild_garden_of_the_gut_bacteria_6.jpg?resize=1024,684 1024w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wild_garden_of_the_gut_bacteria_6.jpg?resize=1280,854 1280w"&gt;&lt;div class="img-caption"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;An entry for the American Society of Microbiology Agar Art competition.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-microbiome-and-the-immune-system"&gt;The microbiome and the immune system&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key ideas in &lt;em&gt;The Microbiome Master Key&lt;/em&gt; is that your gut microbiome plays a powerful — though still not fully understood — role in regulating your immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several patterns suggest a strong link between the gut and the immune response. For one, the gut houses 70–80% of the body’s immune cells. In addition, low-grade inflammation tends to increase as we age. At the same time, the composition of the gut microbiome shifts, often to favor microbial species associated with inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these observations suggest a possible connection between age-related inflammation and changes in the gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are beginning to uncover mechanisms that support this idea. Certain gut microbes produce signaling molecules that help train immune cells to distinguish between harmless and harmful substances. Since the immune system constantly samples its environment through the gut, a well-balanced microbiome may help prevent overreactions (like allergies and autoimmune disorders) and under reactions (which can leave the body vulnerable to infection).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emerging evidence also shows that disruptions in the gut microbiome can contribute to autoimmune conditions outside the gut. For instance, people with rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis often have altered gut microbial communities. These findings suggest that supporting a balanced microbiome could be one way to reduce low-grade inflammation and potentially help prevent or manage age-related and autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-mind-gut-conne-ction"&gt;The mind-gut conne&lt;strong&gt;ction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tend to think of the brain as the body’s command center, but more and more, it looks like the gut microbiome has a prominent say in the conversation. For me, the idea that bacteria in your gut could affect your mood, anxiety levels, and even cognitive function was one of the book’s biggest “Wait! What?” moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brett wasn’t surprised by my fascination. “The potential of the gut–brain axis is the most exciting area of research for most people,” he tells me. He’s referring to the complex communication network between the gut and the brain, which includes a major nerve called the vagus nerve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This nerve isn’t a one-way street. The brain regulates gut function, but the gut sends signals back, and that’s where microbes come in. Research suggests the microbiome may influence the brain by producing neurotransmitters or interacting with gut neurons connected to the vagus nerve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also growing evidence to link disruptions in the gut microbiome to various conditions, such as stress, depression, and anxiety. For example, the Finlays highlight one study where researchers transferred fecal matter from stressed rodents into healthy ones. Afterward, the healthy animals began showing signs of stress themselves. The researchers changed the animals’ moods and behaviors simply by changing their gut microbiota. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We give [microbes] a home and food. In return, they help us function. They’re with us from birth to death. You don’t really get to opt out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jessica Finlay&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another study found that people who had taken just a single course of antibiotics in the past year had a significantly higher risk of developing depression. There’s also emerging evidence connecting the microbiome to neurological conditions like Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and even stroke. (It was around this time in the book that I had my “who am I?” moment).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although a complete picture of the gut-brain relationship is still evolving, the knowledge is already actionable. The Finlays reference the MIND diet (short for Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay), a plant-forward dietary approach that includes leafy greens, berries, poultry, and fish to reduce the risk of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who follow this diet have delayed the onset of Parkinson’s by up to 17 years,” Brett points out. The book also cites studies showing that the MIND diet can reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s by as much as 50%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out, this brain-friendly diet is exactly what people’s gut microbes thrive on. So, while scientists are still working out the details, the overlapping evidence suggests one promising explanation: It may support brain health, at least in part, by supporting the microbes in your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beyond-the-gut-and-beyond-th-e-body"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond the gut and beyond th&lt;/strong&gt;e&lt;strong&gt; body&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microbes aren’t just in the gut. On the skin, they help create chemicals that maintain our protective barrier, may influence whether you sunburn, and even hold the key to pesky signs of aging like wrinkles. In the mouth, they affect gum health and possibly heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t stop at the surface, either. As Jessica points out, your microbes aren’t just in you. They’re all round you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your zip code is one of the biggest predictors of how long you live,” she notes, and after immersing herself in microbiome research, she’s come to believe that microbes may help explain why place matters so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you touch your counter? Microbes. A door handle? Microbes. Package from Amazon? More microbes. A handshake or hug? Think of it as a microbial swap. For some, the idea that microbes are everywhere might sound alarming, but the Finlays argue that this constant exposure isn’t something to fear. It’s something to design for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a huge opportunity in public policy and architecture,” Brett says. “We can build environments that support microbial health, not just sterilize it away.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jessica adds, “Imagine hospitals, schools, and care homes designed not only to keep pathogens out, but to support beneficial microbes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that case, how do we take care of our microbiome and ensure it’s populated with good stuff?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advice will sound familiar: Eat a primarily plant-based diet (microbes love fiber), exercise regularly (physical activity seems to support a more diverse and resilient microbiome), stay socially connected, reduce stress, and get enough sleep. Less common but still beneficial advice includes enjoying more fermented foods, opening the windows in your home to let the air in, and getting outside in nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best thing about the microbiome is that you can change it. You can’t change your human DNA. But bacterial DNA? That’s flexible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Brett Finlay&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for probiotics, the Finlays note, they likely won’t hurt, but there’s little evidence they do much to broadly support the microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, something as fundamental as our microbial ecosystem thrives when we follow the same habits we already know support human health. But that raises another question: What does the microbiome lens add if the lifestyle advice remains the same?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding why these activities could benefit my microbiome, and by extension, me, gives me a more fundamental, ecological understanding of why these actions help,” Jessica says. “And that type of knowledge is more motivating and meaningful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She adds, “I love that I don’t have to recommend some crazy supplement or strict regimen. It’s just eating well. Open a window. Go outside. Shake hands. Move your body. Knowing that all these things help my microbiome just makes me want to do them more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone who tries, but admittedly doesn’t always succeed, in following that advice, I asked them what they’d recommend to an overworked person who is stressed out, potentially sick, and fresh off a regimen of antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The best thing about the microbiome is that you can change it,” Brett says. “You can’t change your human DNA. But bacterial DNA? That’s flexible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told me that even in animal studies where the microbiome has been nearly wiped out, introducing basic conditions like healthy food can restore balance within days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re all around us,” he says. “If you take antibiotics, for example, and start taking simple, proactive steps — like eating fermented foods, spending time outside, or adjusting your habits to support them — they’ll find you. And once they do? Those beneficial functions kick in fast.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/jon-flobrant-_r19nfvS3wY-unsplash.jpg?w=5272" alt="A person wearing jeans and white shoes balances while walking along a fallen log on a forest path covered with leaves." class="wp-image-573589" sizes="auto, (max-width: 767px) 96vw, (max-width: 1280px) 60vw, (max-width: 1536px) 46vw, 710px" srcset="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/jon-flobrant-_r19nfvS3wY-unsplash.jpg 5272w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/jon-flobrant-_r19nfvS3wY-unsplash.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/jon-flobrant-_r19nfvS3wY-unsplash.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/jon-flobrant-_r19nfvS3wY-unsplash.jpg?resize=20,12 20w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/jon-flobrant-_r19nfvS3wY-unsplash.jpg?resize=375,250 375w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/jon-flobrant-_r19nfvS3wY-unsplash.jpg?resize=640,427 640w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/jon-flobrant-_r19nfvS3wY-unsplash.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/jon-flobrant-_r19nfvS3wY-unsplash.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/jon-flobrant-_r19nfvS3wY-unsplash.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w"&gt;&lt;div class="img-caption"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Finlays’ advice for keeping your microbiome healthy will sound familiar: Exercise, eat a healthy diet, be socially connected, and get outside into nature.

Ironically, we still don’t have a clear definition of what a “healthy” microbiome even is. There’s no universal set of microbial species that defines good health. Different people can have diverse microbiomes and still be perfectly healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If the microbiome is so fundamentally important, why don’t we all have similar microbial communities?” Brett asked. “It’s a central question and a sticking point in microbiome research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leading theory, he explains, is functional redundancy — the idea that different microbes can perform the same roles. “Even though the bacterial makeup might differ, the functions they carry out are relatively conserved across people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can tell that applied use, clinically and in public policy, is where the Finlays believe and hope the science is heading. Throughout the book, they sketch out futuristic possibilities that may be closer than you think: preventing diseases with the microbiome, personalized supplements tailored to your unique microbiome, bacteria-informed skincare, microbial interventions to boost athletic performance, the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-i-think-therefore-i-host"&gt;I think … therefore I host?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Microbiome Master Key&lt;/em&gt; is a technical and scientific book at heart, but the Finlays also strike a surprisingly personal tone. In fact, the book reads like an ode to the underappreciated microbes that make us who we are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of our conversation, I wasn’t as concerned with whether I had “true agency” or if bacteria were secretly calling the shots. In the end, it’s all still me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe Descartes had it wrong. Maybe I think … because we are?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="https://www.uniklinikum-dresden.de/en/the-hospital/departments-and-institutes/otorhinolaryngology/interdisciplinary-center-smell-taste/employees/prof-dr-med-thomas-hummel"&gt;Thomas Hummel&lt;/a&gt; gets a whiff of an unripe, green tomato, he finds himself in his childhood home in Bavaria. Under the tilted ceilings of the bedroom that he shared with his two older brothers, there were three beds, a simple table and a cupboard. “My mother put those green tomatoes on the cupboard for them to ripen,” said Hummel, an olfaction researcher at the Carl Gustav Carus University Hospital in Germany. “They have this very specific smell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s grassy, green, pungent, rough and bitter, he said. When he passes by a bin of tomatoes at the market today, “it is always to some degree emotional,” he said, “like every smell is emotional.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smell is deeply tied with the emotion and memory centers of our brain. Lavender perfume might evoke memories of a close friend. A waft of cheap vodka, a relic of college days, might make you grimace. The smell of a certain laundry detergent, the same one your grandparents used, might bring tears to your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smell is also our most ancient sense, tracing back billions of years to the first chemical-sensing cells. But scientists know little about it compared to other senses — vision and hearing in particular. That’s in part because smell has not been deemed critical to our survival; humans have been wrongly considered “bad smellers” for more than a century. It’s also not easy to study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a highly dimensional sense,” said &lt;a href="https://monell.org/valentina-parma/"&gt;Valentina Parma&lt;/a&gt;, an olfactory researcher at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia. “We don’t know exactly how chemicals translate to perception.” But scientists are making progress toward systematically characterizing and quantifying what it means to smell by breaking the process down to its most fundamental elements — from the odor molecules that enter your nose to the individual neurons that process them in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several new databases, including one recently published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Scientific Data&lt;/em&gt;, are attempting to establish &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-025-04644-2"&gt;a shared scientific language&lt;/a&gt; for the perception of molecular scents — what individual molecules “smell like” to us. And on the other end of the pathway, researchers recently published a study in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; describing how those scent molecules are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08016-5"&gt;translated into a neural language&lt;/a&gt; that triggers emotions and memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these efforts are painting a richer picture of our strongest memory-teleportation device. This higher-resolution look is challenging the long-held assumption that smell is our least important sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anosmatique&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that humans are bad at smelling comes from a hundred-year-old misunderstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="post__aside mb2 relative post__aside--right"&gt;&lt;figure class="mb2 mt1 image--shortcode s:mt-0"&gt;
    
            &lt;figcaption class="image__meta mt1"&gt;
                            &lt;div class="caption wysiwyg h5 theme__anchors--solid fill-h post__aside__caption post__aside__caption--shortcode"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;The neuroanatomist Paul Broca defined humans as &lt;em&gt;anosmatique&lt;/em&gt;, or “non-smelling,” setting off a hundred-year misunderstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="attribution theme__anchors--solid wysiwyg pangram h6 mb1 fill-h post__aside__attribution"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;history_docu_photo/Alamy Stock Photo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 19th century, the French neuroanatomist Paul Broca was trying to explain why humans have free will and other animals don’t, despite the similarities between our brains. He pointed out that in humans, the olfactory bulbs — the primary brain areas for analysis of information flowing in from the nose — are relatively small compared to overall brain size. In contrast, the olfactory bulbs of mice and horses are massive relative to the rest of their brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He concluded that the sense of smell drives behavior, particularly irrational behavior, in animals. Humans can choose to respond to smells — but can also ignore them. This led Broca to label humans as &lt;em&gt;anosmatique&lt;/em&gt;, or “non-smellers,” and some other animals as &lt;em&gt;osmatique&lt;/em&gt;, or “smellers.” Our mastery over smell, he suggested, made us higher forms of life. “He made this big conclusion,” said &lt;a href="https://psych.rutgers.edu/people/chair-v-cs/faculty-profile/119-john-mcgann"&gt;John McGann&lt;/a&gt;, an olfactory researcher at Rutgers University. “And then he died almost immediately after that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before long, the English anatomist Sir William Turner mistranslated Broca’s findings. To him, Broca was drawing a conclusion about smelling ability rather than free will, suggesting that humans are bad smellers while dogs are good smellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Through a series of telephone games, people just kept repeating the idea, ‘Oh, humans don’t need smell,” said &lt;a href="https://hosting.med.upenn.edu/gottfriedlab/people/"&gt;Sarah Cormiea&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral researcher studying olfaction at the University of Pennsylvania. Freud didn’t help: In his various musings throughout the 20th century, he also claimed that smell was a primitive sense that merely lingered from our ancient, animalistic past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wasn’t entirely wrong. Researchers trace the mammalian sense of smell back 3 billion years to bacteria in the ancient oceans. To find food and move toward it, these organisms detected chemical gradients. Molecules in the water docked onto proteins on a bacterium’s cell membrane, triggering internal signals that urged the organism toward or away from increasing concentrations of the chemical. This ability, called chemosensation, is the most rudimentary form of smell, and it has many parallels to olfactory systems in complex, multicellular animals such as mammals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="mb2 mt1 image--shortcode s:mt-0"&gt;
    
            &lt;figcaption class="image__meta mt1"&gt;
                            &lt;div class="caption wysiwyg h5 theme__anchors--solid fill-h post__aside__caption post__aside__caption--shortcode"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;A bouquet of around 800 different molecules makes up the scent of a rose.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that sense, smell is our most ancient interface with the environment, said &lt;a href="https://liu.se/en/employee/matla69"&gt;Matthias Laska&lt;/a&gt;, a zoologist at Linköping University in Sweden. “No single cell can see or hear. But single cells already can respond to chemicals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our modern chemical sense is far more complicated. In the 1990s, the future Nobel Prize–winning biologists &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2004/7438-the-nobel-prize-in-physiology-or-medicine-2004-2004-5/"&gt;Linda Buck and Richard Axel&lt;/a&gt; discovered genes that code for odorant receptors in mammals. Later studies showed that humans have around 400 types of olfactory receptors in the nose, and that millions of these receptors line the nasal passages. Each receptor is a protein that can recognize and latch onto many kinds of odorants — molecules that are light enough to evaporate off your cup of coffee, the wet grass outside, or the microbes in your armpits, and waft into the air and, in turn, your nasal passages.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Thomas Hummel has spent many decades studying the sense of smell. His colleague Antonie Bierling calls him the “European pope of olfaction.”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you smell a rose, more than 800 different odorants enter your nose and bind to olfactory receptors expressed in the cell membranes of various neurons, which fire to create a particular pattern interpreted by the brain. There are 5.8 million molecules on Earth that could possibly be odorants detectable by humans, although no one has the time or means to determine whether we can smell all of these, Laska said. However, we tend to underestimate our sense of smell because we lack a vocabulary for it, said &lt;a href="https://www.klipsy.uni-jena.de/en/484/antonie-bierling-m-sc"&gt;Antonie Bierling&lt;/a&gt;, who studies olfaction at the Dresden University of Technology. Visually, we might describe a pineapple as a yellow and green fruit wrapped in scaly skin. But how would you describe what a pineapple smells like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This smells like a pineapple,” Hummel said. “But we don’t know how to describe pineapple.” Our smell words are often linked to their source — for example, something smells grassy or like a wet dog or like a pineapple. He added: “What makes the pineapple a pineapple?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This difficulty with describing smells, at least in some languages like English, has limited our ability to study the human sense. Several groups of researchers are now addressing this problem systematically. It’s largely mysterious how the chemical structures of an odor molecule relate to smell, Bierling said. “The only way to change that is to create data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-Molecule Smells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a light has a certain wavelength, you will describe what you are seeing as red. If a sound is a certain frequency, you will hear an F sharp. But there’s no similarly easy way to map odors, which often arrive at our noses as a bouquet of different molecules. What’s more, that bouquet can smell different to every person depending on the context in which they smell it and their past experiences with that scent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Real odors are complicated and multidimensional,” Cormiea said. “People don’t have a good understanding of what features of an odor stimulus, like a molecule, produce what perceptual experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does a flower smell like a flower, and what makes cheese smell like cheese? Odorous molecules have many dimensions that can define or affect their smell. Are they big or small? What other molecules are they interacting with? Do they have a charge? Even molecules that are mirror images of one another, &lt;a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-the-universe-differs-from-its-mirror-image-20250514/"&gt;a property called chirality&lt;/a&gt;, can smell completely different. For example, pine and citrus scents are opposite-handed chiral forms of the molecule limonene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Quanta Magazine</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 14:28:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE52OUtWNF8zbkpIZUJhVHBRcDd6TnFXN1Q1Vjl5NU13TUI5blNieU15dnRiR3EtQ0JyMXYzZW5TUTFMOHhRaldpZmZPcW1WYW5vRUQ1anItSjVWdGpUT0dGY2NMWjFmejNjY1g4WFpJb2N6M0pIQjd3UW4waXB6Zw</guid></item><item><title>小RFK ， CDC专家组一直在质疑乙型肝炎疫苗。安全的原因- ABC新闻-突发新闻、最新新闻和视频 | RFK Jr., CDC panel have been casting doubt on the hepatitis B vaccine.

Current drugs ease symptoms but do little to halt the relentless loss of movement, speech, and independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/xiaobo-mao/2777172" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Xiaobo Mao&lt;/a&gt; of Johns Hopkins University led an international team that traced the blockade to a newly revealed partnership between two brain proteins, Aplp1 and LAG‑3. Their study offers a practical target for slowing disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-cancer-drug-blocks-parkinson-s"&gt;How cancer drug blocks Parkinson’s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-023-05672-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alpha‑synuclein&lt;/a&gt; normally helps nerve cells chat across synapses, yet when it misfolds it becomes sticky and forms Lewy bodies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group discovered that Aplp1 and LAG‑3 act like twin door handles, swinging the misfolded cargo into neurons together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now that we know how Aplp1 and LAG-3 interact, we have a new way of understanding how alpha‑synuclein contributes to the disease progression of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/pesticide-exposure-increases-the-risk-of-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s &lt;/a&gt;disease,” confirmed Mao.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deleting either handle in genetically engineered mice cut protein uptake, but deleting both slashed it by 90 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using cultured neurons, the team showed that antibodies against LAG‑3 disrupted the partnership and kept most toxic fibrils outside. That hint of druggability set the stage for tests with the approved melanoma therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-repurposing-a-cancer-drug-for-parkinson-s"&gt;Repurposing a cancer drug for Parkinson’s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nivolumab–relatlimab, marketed as &lt;a href="https://www.opdualag.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Opdualag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;, won &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-opdualag-unresectable-or-metastatic-melanoma" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FDA clearance&lt;/a&gt; in 2022 as the first combination to target PD‑1 and LAG‑3 checkpoints in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/computer-model-can-identify-tumor-fighting-immune-cells/"&gt;tumors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because relatlimab binds LAG‑3, the Parkinson’s team wondered whether it could also short‑circuit the neural handshake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They injected the antibody mix into mice previously dosed with pathogenic fibrils. Treated animals accumulated far fewer Lewy‑like inclusions, keeping the midbrain’s &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dopamine-enhances-brain-function-during-exercise/"&gt;dopamine&lt;/a&gt; supply and motor skills intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The anti‑LAG-3 antibody was successful in preventing further spread of alpha‑synuclein seeds in the mouse models,” said &lt;a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/ted-m-dawson/2708436" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ted Dawson&lt;/a&gt;, also from Johns Hopkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect outperformed complete genetic knockout of LAG‑3 because the drug simultaneously disrupted its partner, Aplp1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-protein-traffic-jam-in-the-brain"&gt;A protein traffic jam in the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain’s &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12034127/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;substantia nigra&lt;/a&gt; houses dopamine‑producing neurons that fine‑tune movement. When alpha‑synuclein fibrils march from cell to cell, these neurons choke and die, triggering tremor and rigidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAG-3 had been flagged as a fibril receptor before, yet blocking it alone left plenty of pathology. The new work clarifies that Aplp1 forms a complex with LAG-3, which creates a high‑affinity docking site for toxic cargo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By filming neurons with pH‑sensitive dye, researchers watched fibrils enter healthy cells in minutes. Removal of either handle delayed entry, while removal of both stopped it almost completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery may explain why single‑target strategies have struggled to translate. Therapies that ignore Aplp1 risk leaving a back‑door route open for disease spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-parkinson-s-is-so-difficult"&gt;Why Parkinson’s is so difficult&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s is diagnosed only after motor symptoms emerge, by which time over half of nigral dopamine neurons have perished. &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/lewy-body-dementia/lewy-body-dementia-causes-symptoms-and-diagnosis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lewy bodies&lt;/a&gt; start forming decades earlier and appear to propagate along neural highways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists debate whether the fibrils cause disease or merely mark dying cells, yet the correlation is strong enough that reducing their spread remains a key goal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal studies that limit fibril movement often preserve motor behavior and cortical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Aplp1–Lag3 duo offers a concise molecular explanation for long‑range propagation. It also supplies a measurable biomarker, their physical interaction, that drug developers can monitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-antibodies-in-action"&gt;Antibodies in action&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preclinical success seldom guarantees human benefit, yet repurposing an approved therapy skips many safety hurdles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opdualag’s&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; pharmacokinetics, dosing, and adverse‑event profile are already mapped in thousands of cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The antibody crosses the mouse blood–brain barrier at roughly 0.5 percent of plasma levels, similar to other &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-20642/immune-globulin-human-igg-intravenous/details" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IgG medicines&lt;/a&gt;. That level sufficed to curb fibril uptake and protect motor performance in pole and cylinder tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If forthcoming primate and human studies confirm brain penetration, clinicians could move swiftly into small Parkinson’s trials using this cancer treatment drug. Outcome measures might track motor scores, cerebrospinal fibril counts, and imaging of nigral dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-parkinson-s-gets-help-from-cancer-drug"&gt;Parkinson’s gets help from cancer drug&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/light-activated-molecules-kill-cancer-cells-with-precision/"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; checkpoint drugs can unleash immune‑related side effects, including rash, thyroid imbalance, and fatigue. Whether similar events would occur at lower neurological doses remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another question is timing. Most &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/reprogramming-the-immune-system-to-attack-cancer-cells/"&gt;cancer antibodies&lt;/a&gt; are delivered in pulses, whereas chronic neuroprotection for Parkinson’s patients might require years of therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, fibril spread is only one facet of Parkinson’s biology. Mitochondrial stress, environmental toxins, and genetics also contribute, so a combination of treatments will likely be needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, the ease of testing an off‑the‑shelf cancer medicine for Parkinson’s patients makes this avenue irresistible. As Dawson observed, stopping spread “could significantly slow the progression of Parkinson’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49016-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 14:11:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOSTBtX0Nlc0hzTWE5Y3Z0Y0g1eDg3T2E1RUxDZ3d5V2pBZHVNd0JYVGdxdzhGenJCNjYwVk45R0dQTHJvX0xockN3bHFrWjI5VlBhbmNFRzRFdmZnYXU5aDNLNWdLa3hac2tsalBzXzE2MlB6Q2I2ZEpFbVJYMlFsYnMxY3I0RkRvTmgzSUNpVVpwVjF0X1ZJdWNvUW1NV01rN1BFMWtaNWl3QQ</guid></item><item><title>救命！我有一个很大的关系秘密，我对我所有的朋友都保密。但我不确定我还能不能再做下去。- Slate杂志 | Help!

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="2" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk1smn002q3577flleshgn@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Prudence, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="102" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk1spf002r35778ebbhab5@published"&gt;I have been dating my lovely partner “B” for six months. They haven’t met any of my friends yet: scheduling is a nightmare, we live an awkward distance apart, and college takes up basically all of our energy. I am working on organizing a get-together eventually, though not now. Complicating things, B is currently going through a severe depressive episode.&lt;br&gt;They have a mental health team, but it’s been difficult. I guess I’m asking a) how much can I share with my friends and b) if it’s imperative to ask how much I can share, how do I phrase that information request delicately?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="158" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk1ss9002s3577r0d1wcvr@published"&gt;On one hand, I feel like protecting privacy should come first, so I’ve basically just told my friends that B’s busy and had some mental health stuff going on in the vaguest terms. On the other hand, my therapist suggested I utilize my support network more since this has been really hard on me too (not more so than B, of course). Because my friends haven’t even met B, I feel like not only would this be sharing information that’s not mine to share, it’s also messing with first impressions before they’ve even all met. I’m also afraid that asking B about how much stuff I can share on how they’re doing with my friends will send them into a bad spiral about how their illness is affecting me and I should leave them (this has happened a couple times), as well as make them feel awkward around my friends when we finally make the time to meet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="45" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk1sut002t3577kqa3rzvz@published"&gt;Again, B does have professional help, but things have just been really awful lately and nothing seems to be working. I love this person and want them to be well. I know they want to be well, too. We are trying our best. Please advise!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="3" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk1sz0002u3577nyp3g428@published"&gt;—What to Say?&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmjza1k003nvcm6dpoqlfpv@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenée Desmond-Harris&lt;/strong&gt;: I admire this letter writer for trying to do the right thing here, because I wouldn’t even think about it. After just six months with someone who may or may not last another six months, I’m telling my friends (who I plan to have forever) everything. I’m not saying that’s right but I do think it’s pretty normal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk24vx002z3577wdlq2avv@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lizzie O’Leary&lt;/strong&gt;: Wow. I also want to commend this LW for her thoughtfulness, because I probably would have already unloaded a lot of this on a friend or two by now. I have been trying to think through this. and I think there is a delicate balance to strike between getting the support that you, LW, genuinely need, and not biasing your friends against a partner they haven’t met.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="180" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk24vx00303577db1yk59c@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenée&lt;/strong&gt;: I’ve given credit for thoughtfulness, and I’m not going to take it back, but as I reread the letter, what’s jumping out at me is the letter writer’s anxiety about not just the privacy aspect of this, but also a desire to control how it all turns out. She wants to make sure her friends like her partner and that her partner doesn’t get triggered by a conversation about this. And I think my advice about that is that as hard as it is, you have to let it go. Things could go wrong with your relationship or your partner’s mental health for any number of reasons. Or things could work out perfectly too! But you have to kind of let things unfold without being so afraid of making a mistake. If your relationship can’t withstand you saying “Just making sure it’s not a secret that you’re dealing with depression, in case it comes up in my life updates to me friends” and if your friends hold a grudge against someone who (hopefully) makes you happy, that’s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="160" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk24vy00313577m1i2efb8@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lizzie&lt;/strong&gt;: So, as someone who has been both clinically depressed AND dated people who are clinically depressed, I think the LW can talk about this to her friends without asking for permission. Especially since that might set off a spiral (depressed people feel worthless as hell). She doesn’t need to go deep into all her partner’s issues, because that’s not really the point here. The point is that the LW needs support. And so it’s okay to talk about the things in her life that are difficult right now! This is … what friendship is for. I also think that a) we are at a place in society where there is a general understanding that sometimes People Go Through Some Shit, b) LW’s friends are going to form an opinion anyway, and that will fluctuate over time and no one can control that. Check me on this, Jenée, does the LW have to ask for an okay from her partner?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk24vz003235778zwwrahc@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenée&lt;/strong&gt;: The more I think about it, the more I think no. My big reading-between-the-lines conspiracy theory about this one is that the partner is not just depressed but also not treating her very well because of the depression (“This has been really hard on me” could be doing a lot of work). And she is hesitant to share that with her friends because they may legitimately have a bad impression of her partner. So she is—consciously or not—looking for other reasons not to share.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk24vz00333577806hqq61@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lizzie&lt;/strong&gt;: Ohhhhhh that is a very interesting reading! You may be right. I guess it’s a question of how much LW needs the support. Because I think someone who is feeling really bad about themselves might not be able to see the request to share as anything other than a referendum on them. So the LW would really need to lean into “this is about me and wanting to talk about my feelings.” And I am not sure how the partner will take that. So, yeah, share, but be discreet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="109" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk24vz00343577kubzl2q2@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenée&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, I think she should just organize a brunch and give her life updates and get the support she needs. Maybe it’s “They’ve been depressed and it’s been hard because I care so much about them” or maybe it’s “They’ve been depressed and there are days when that makes them really mean to me and they say they can’t see a future with me because of it.” I mean she doesn’t have to include medication doses and side effects of anything. But if your therapist says to lean on your friends, do it! And don’t edit too heavily when it comes to what exactly has been going on.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="3" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcmk24vz00353577iu852mpy@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lizzie&lt;/strong&gt;: Agreed! &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;Gavel!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  

&lt;/div&gt;

So, yeah, these are a massive no from me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, she said eating a banana 30 minutes before your workout will leave you feeling 'plenty of pump'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The FSA recommends consuming no more than 400mg each day of caffeine, which is the equivalent to roughly four cups of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023, several lawsuits were launched in the US against fast food joint Panera Bread over the allegedly harmful effect of its highly caffeinated 'Charged Lemonade' drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;DailyMail.com found that some health drinks that feature health-related claims on the label, like clean', 'plant-based' and 'natural', have as much as three cups of coffee worth of caffeine, which could be harmful to the three million Americans with long QT syndrome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; A 28 year-old Rhode Island woman took legal action against the chain, alleging the beverage left her with long-term heart problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lauren Skerritt, an athlete, drank two-and-a-half Charged Lemonades at a Panera location in Greenville, Rhode Island, in April 2022, according to the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After drinking the lemonade, Skerritt allegedly experienced new episodes of palpitations and dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scans later showed that she was suffering atrial fibrillation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It followed the tragic death of a 21-year-old Pennsylvania college student in the US, who according to court documents, suffered a fatal cardiac arrest after consuming the lemonade—which contained 390mg of caffeine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Katz suffered a serious heart rhythm condition called long QT syndrome, which causes the heart to beat irregularly (arrhythmia). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was diagnosed with the condition aged five and had managed it with medication and limiting caffeine, according to documents written by lawyers representing her parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Stuart Fischer, an internal medicine physician in New York, told &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12666137/Panera-Bread-charged-lemonade-lawsuit-caffeine-drinks-safety.html"&gt;DailyMail.com&lt;/a&gt; that caffeine can eliminate the vital breaks in between heart beats for people with long QT syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Patients with this condition needs a little bit longer than usual to reboot after the heart muscle has contracted.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caffeine, he explains, speeds up the beating pattern, placing too much stress on the already stretched organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If there is too much activity when the muscle needs to relax, it can be potentially fatal or at least a major medical emergency.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Fischer added that just 100mg of caffeine, which is the same as a large cup of coffee, could be enough to trigger a deadly attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 13:42:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxPOF92SzFMOTlGVmk4dkpqUS14Uml1a3dlWEhoWkFUVERUaG5HYUdzU3RtNHNjQmJjWHFlQ2tqUDhTaHVWb3FZVmtDeGlGaWRUZkozWk1ISkN1SEtOWG0weHJpd2F1SFZZUGRtOF83VF9tMllpbmVUUUdDemw0Z2FNQjVXc21UcmNpS2x2T2VGdWVHTlRMdGI3T0pWZ3BaQjlJbVhudi1R0gGrAUFVX3lxTE4wamt1MVFZVW05NjlJU2V6VWYxTXh0ZndqZmZjQmNtVGhOYWVJYk9Na0REUzFvRUZKN0htbnJxR3hQQll6a0RVa1p4TVAyaG9JcVhPNUU4NUJzdFkwZTNiRHhSRHlEVE9FbWNkUDBaY1V5dmlvWFNUVkJTenQ2VGFmSG9XSjE4S0t4bkY5amNGcnZMSjFVZElrbUx5OUhqWnh5LWJ2RUptaURmcw</guid></item><item><title>一对夫妇试图怀孕18年。人工智能助其一臂之力- East Idaho News | A couple tried for 18 years to get pregnant.

A typical semen sample contains hundreds of millions of sperm, but men with azoospermia have such low counts that no sperm cells can be found, even after hours of meticulous searching under a microscope.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So the couple, who wish to remain anonymous to protect their privacy, went to the Columbia University Fertility Center to try a novel approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s called the STAR method, and it uses AI to help identify and recover hidden sperm in men who once thought they had no sperm at all. All the husband had to do was leave a semen sample with the medical team.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We kept our hopes to a minimum after so many disappointments,” the wife said in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the fertility center analyzed the semen sample with the AI system. Three hidden sperm were found, recovered and used to fertilize the wife’s eggs via IVF, and she became the first successful pregnancy enabled by the STAR method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The baby is due in December.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It took me two days to believe I was actually pregnant,” she said. “I still wake up in the morning and can’t believe if this is true or not. I still don’t believe I am pregnant until I see the scans.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence has advanced the field of fertility care in the United States: More medical facilities are using AI to help assess egg quality or screen for healthy embryos when patients are undergoing IVF. There’s still more research and testing needed, but AI may now be making advancements in male infertility, in particular.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Zev Williams, director of the Columbia University Fertility Center, and his colleagues spent five years developing the STAR method to help detect and recover sperm in semen samples from people who had azoospermia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They were struck by the system’s results.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“A patient provided a sample, and highly skilled technicians looked for two days through that sample to try to find sperm. They didn’t find any. We brought it to the AI-based STAR System. In one hour, it found 44 sperm. So right then, we realized, ‘Wow, this is really a game-changer. This is going to make such a big difference for patients,’ ” said Williams, who led the research team.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When a semen sample is placed on a specially designed chip under a microscope, the STAR system – which stands for Sperm Tracking and Recovery – connects to the microscope through a high-speed camera and high-powered imaging technology to scan the sample, taking more than 8 million images in under an hour to find what it has been trained to identify as a sperm cell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The system instantly isolates that sperm cell into a tiny droplet of media, allowing embryologists to recover cells that they may never have been able to find or identify with their own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s like searching for a needle scattered across a thousand haystacks, completing the search in under an hour and doing it so gently, without any harmful lasers or stains, that the sperm can still be used to fertilize an egg,” Williams said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What’s remarkable is that instead of the usual [200 million] to 300 million sperm in a typical sample, these patients may have just two or three. Not 2 [million] or 3 million, literally two or three,” he said. “But with the precision of the STAR system and the expertise of our embryologists, even those few can be used to successfully fertilize an egg.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Shocking and unexpected diagnosis’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s estimated that the male partner accounts for up to 40% of all infertility cases in the United States, and up to 10% of men with infertility are azoospermic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This often is a really heartbreaking and shocking and unexpected diagnosis,” Williams said. “Most men who have azoospermia feel completely healthy and normal. There’s no impairment of their sexual function, and the semen looks normal, too. The difference is that when you look at it under a microscope, instead of seeing literally hundreds of millions of sperm swimming, you just see cell debris and fragments but no sperm.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Treatment options for azoospermia traditionally have included uncomfortable surgery to retrieve sperm directly from a patient’s testes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“A part of the testes gets removed and broken into little pieces, and you try to find sperm there,” Williams said. “It’s invasive. You can only do it a couple of times before there could be permanent scarring and damage to the testes, and it’s painful.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other treatment options may include prescription hormone medications – but that will be effective only if the person has an imbalance of hormones. If no other treatment options are successful, couples may use donor sperm to have a child.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Williams said the STAR method can be a new option.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It really was a team effort to develop this, and that’s what really drove and motivated everybody, the fact that you can now help couples who otherwise couldn’t have that opportunity,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although the method is currently available only at the Columbia University Fertility Center, Williams and his colleagues want to publish their work and share it with other fertility centers. Using the STAR method to find, isolate and freeze sperm for a patient would cost a little under $3,000 total, he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Infertility is unique in a way in that it’s such an ancient part of the human experience. It’s literally biblical. It’s something we’ve had to contend with through all of human history,” he said. “It’s amazing to think that the most advanced technologies that we currently have are being used to solve this really ancient problem.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘AI is helping us see what our eyes can’t’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not the first time doctors have turned to AI to help men with azoospermia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A separate research team in Canada built an AI model that could automate and accelerate the process of searching for rare sperm in samples from men with the condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The reason AI is so well-suited for this is AI really relies on learning – showing it an image of what a sperm looks like, what the shape is, what characteristics it should have – and then being able to use that learning algorithm to help identify that specific image that you’re looking for,” said Dr. Sevann Helo, a urologist at Mayo Clinic with specialty interest in male infertility and male sexual dysfunction, who was not involved in the STAR method or the research in Canada.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s very exciting,” she said. “AI, in general, at least in the medical community, I think is a whole new landscape and really will revolutionize the way we look at a lot of problems in medicine.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The STAR method is a novel approach to identifying sperm, but AI has been used in many other ways within fertility medicine too, said Dr. Aimee Eyvazzadeh, a San Francisco-based reproductive endocrinologist and host of the podcast “The Egg Whisperer Show.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“AI is helping us see what our eyes can’t,” Eyvazzadeh, who was not involved in the development of STAR, wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For instance, AI algorithms, such as one called Stork-A, have been used to analyze early-stage embryos and predict with “surprising accuracy” which ones are likely to be healthy. Another AI tool, CHLOE, can assess the quality of a woman’s eggs before she may freeze them for future use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“AI is being used to personalize IVF medication protocols, making cycles more efficient and less of a guessing game. It’s also helping with sperm selection, identifying the healthiest sperm even in difficult samples. And AI can now even predict IVF success rates with more precision than ever before, using massive data sets to give patients personalized guidance,” Eyvazzadeh said. “The common thread? Better decisions, more confidence, and a more compassionate experience for patients.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new STAR system is “a game-changer,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“AI isn’t creating sperm – it’s helping us find the rare, viable ones that are already there but nearly invisible,” she said. “It’s a breakthrough not because it replaces human expertise, but because it amplifies it – and that’s the future of fertility care.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But there is also a growing concern that the rushed application of AI in reproductive medicine could give false hope to patients, said Dr. Gianpiero Palermo, professor of embryology and director of andrology and assisted fertilization at Weill Cornell Medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“AI is gaining a lot of traction nowadays to offer unbiased evaluation on embryos by looking at embryo morphology,” Palermo said in an email. “However, current available models are still somewhat inconsistent and require additional validation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Palermo said the STAR approach needs to be validated and would still require human embryologists to pick up sperm and inject them into an egg to create an embryo for patients undergoing IVF.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Maybe the AI addition may help to retrieve the spermatozoon a little faster and maybe one more than the embryologist,” said Palermo, who was not involved in the development of STAR but was the first to describe the method of injecting sperm directly into an egg. Since he pioneered that method, it has become the most-utilized assisted reproductive technology in the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In my opinion, this approach is faulty because inevitably some men will have no spermatozoa,” Palermo said of the STAR method, “doesn’t matter how their specimens are screened whether by humans or a machine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>East Idaho News</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 13:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxOWWZybm5GYzBia2RWSW1rVm9CYzBDRGdmLUNsOHhaS21XeXRwbkJ5aVJ6bDEwdHk3ckxLSGdCZmRGcDd1dXg4cEt4b2gwbjViaFZkTXRuQzVQOFBSc2NHX2Q0bkhVTGdVaU5EekgxeWFSWVk3bm5lYUpVR1ZkNUZSd05lcURhRlM1NndWR1FDRi1IV1p3YS1sTGNkSnBwcW5XZ1E</guid></item><item><title>“我妈妈差点死于这种疾病” ： 21种可能比你想象的更严重的常见疾病-雅虎 | "My Mom Almost Died From It": 21 Common Medical Conditions That Can Be Much, Much More Serious Than You Think - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTE1CNVJtY2k5MVJYM1BkbDR6N3dxUFJIYUNfdm9Qc1pHZGt4Z2lSQXdjRjlEbGh6aGVIZHJGNjl1MFdNUjFsVVUyY2RpTHlYRERGZWxnT2tLWHVTbl9qY3VLTjZrZ0RySVBldnZ0NFRaaTJyUjZpanc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When it comes to our health, sometimes seemingly small things can have big consequences.

But even plain old iron deficiency anemia can be extremely debilitating and difficult to treat."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I have regular old iron deficiency anemia. It's caused by extremely heavy and constant menstruation from a combination of uterine fibroids and bilateral ovarian masses that are quite literally the size of small melons. I am scheduled for surgery in September, but I need to manage as best I can until then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The fatigue and tiredness I feel are beyond description. Some days, I can barely even make myself get up to go to the bathroom. Most days, I can only muster up enough energy to be functional for a couple of hours. I can't drive long distances anymore. I'm worried it's not safe. I'm always cold, my hair is falling out, and my skin is dry and itchy. I also get sores in my mouth and bruises that never heal. I take supplements, eat an iron-rich diet, and have infusions, but it's slow going to actually see improvement. The anemia and the treatments I've undergone to help fix it have caused a cascade of other vitamin and mineral deficiencies that have their own side effects. I can't be out in the sun, or I break out in hives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some of my issues have been caused by the bleeding itself, like dehydration and hypovolemia.

It's definitely commonly recognized and treated, but I don't think most non-ADHD people truly understand how frustrating it is to live with it. Your whole life revolves around it, because unless you're always keeping it in check, you can't live in normal society, and it's fucking exhausting having to always be hyper aware of everything you do. Your productivity, your memory, your sensory perception, all of that, is, by default, hindered permanently compared to a neurotypical person, but unfortunately, most things are built around neurotypical capabilities (working 9-5, etc.), and it's so mentally draining to force yourself to adapt to that culture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Meds and good habits help, but they can only do so much. No matter what you do or take, you will sooner or later fall into a cycle of procrastination, of forgetfulness, of 'ADHD paralysis,' of sensory overstimulation, and it fucking sucks because it's so difficult to explain to people. It's become so normalized that most people, at least the ones I've talked to, think you're overplaying it or that it's not that big of a deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Productivitycafe/comments/1lm7onn/what_is_a_medical_condition_that_is_more_serious/n07acsx/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Frysken;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Frysken&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;21.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;And finally, "Impacted wisdom teeth.

&lt;p&gt;If they don’t grow in right, most people will treat their wisdom teeth as bio-baggage, useful only for preventing money from burning a hole in one’s pocket due to the surgical costs of removing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But an astounding new discovery has found that this third set of molars contain a unique form of human stem cell that can be harvested and used to regrow bone, heart tissue, and even neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an exciting field full of promise, full of potential benefits, but substantial amounts of further research and evidence is needed to truly understand what these four extra teeth could do for us in the long term beyond tearing up almonds and salad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, wisdom teeth contain a soft center of tissue called dental pulp that keeps the tooth alive. This pulp contains immature cells which a team of scientists at the University of the Basque Country in Spain have transformed into several different kinds of cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gaskon Ibarretxe, an associate professor in the Cell Biology and Histology Department at the university, led&lt;a href="https://stemcellres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13287-025-04134-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; a recent study&lt;/a&gt; that turned pulp cells into electrically excitable pseudo-neurons that demonstrated “essentially electrical activity” in concert with proper neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They could help treat damaged brain circuitry from any number of conditions or trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dental-pulp-stem-cells-from-extracted-wisdom-teeth-can-treat-multiple-diseases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Earth.com,&lt;/a&gt; pulp-derived stem cells have some interesting and unique properties, including the capacity to build mineralized tissue faster than bone marrow-derived stem cells. Scientists have used dental‑pulp secretions to improve heart ejection fractions in mice with heart failure, and &lt;em&gt;in vitro, &lt;/em&gt;these cells seem to lay down layers of collagen and calcium in neat, orderly sheets, making them potentially attractive for joint cartilage repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the logistics and cost standpoint, they’re an ideal source of stem cells. Bone marrow cells require painful injections that sometimes can’t involve anesthesia, while embryonic or placental stem cells without ethical concerns require someone to decide to have a baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, almost all humans are born with wisdom teeth, and they’re often removed in the teenage years when little DNA damage has taken place inside the dental pulp; making them exceptionally malleable and safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earth.com claims 10 million wisdom teeth are removed every year, but the process of sending them to a biobank could be very simple. A kit—offered by a company like &lt;a href="https://stemodontics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Stemodontics&lt;/a&gt;—could be bought and shipped to a dentist’s office ahead of the procedure. The tooth is put in a vial, placed on dry ice, and rushed to a lab where the pulp would be extracted and preserved as a potentially life-changing form of cellular insurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No donor cells means no risks of rejection, which means no waiting list for finding a matching donor; the dental-pulp cells would be available as soon as they’re needed. If covered by a dental insurance plan, their storage could result in tens of thousands of dollars saved down the line if some of these treatments prove executable and effective.&lt;/p&gt;

ROACH: Following my last 3-D mammogram, I received a warning letter from the mammography center regarding the possible shortfall of mammograms for dense breast tissue. I’ve never received this letter in the past, but I’ve been told that it is a new requirement by insurance companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EGADXF5EH5BQZE4MSGLE4D6K4M"&gt;After doing a little research, I am very confused as to what should be done for those of us who are in this situation and want more reassurance that a normal result is truly normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="36N2DHJBJRAZTFLU2N5QFBWYR4"&gt;Self-exams are also difficult given numerous cysts. There seem to be several routes that could be taken; blood tests for biomarkers, MRIs, and ultrasounds are a few examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NHGJTZYRWVEYPAKUVOOK6KLBTQ"&gt;My family does not have a history of breast cancer, but we do have a history of aggressive prostate cancer as described by an oncologist. I feel like I need to be a strong advocate for myself as Medicare and supplemental insurance only recommend the bare minimum. -- R.W.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FJLORXC7RJCTJG7FMSRRZS6OYA"&gt;ANSWER: My own institution has been sending out these letters for years, so I am very familiar with this question. Dense breast tissue is a risk factor for cancer and makes it harder for the mammogram to spot developing cancer within normal breast tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4JIGFJZVMZBZ5NZK7ODQWW2KHU"&gt;Increased breast density by itself is not an abnormality as about half of women undergoing mammography will have dense breasts. Digital breast tomosynthesis (also called 3-D mammography) is better at imaging dense breasts than digital mammograms, and your center is already using this technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AN65BKV455D3VFZPMF6KVAVJDQ"&gt;Choosing the right breast screening modality requires knowing your risk group. A greater than 20% lifetime chance of getting breast cancer is considered high-risk; 15% to 20% is considered intermediate; and less than 15% is average or low-risk. One common tool to help estimate risk is available at BCRiskTool.cancer.gov. A family history of prostate cancer does not significantly increase your risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PWUDGBPKTFC6LIU7KEBNN36SCI"&gt;Of the three imaging screening tools you asked about, mammography is the best-studied and has been shown in multiple trials to reduce the risk of dying from breast cancer by finding cancers early. The cancer can subsequently be removed before it has a chance to spread. The strongest evidence is for women ages 50-74; screening between 40-50 and over the age of 74 is controversial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YN7UVT3DKBGGRENV4GQM2UVN74"&gt;After my conversations with women about risks and benefits, most choose to begin screening at age 40 or 45, recognizing that there is a chance of a false-positive exam. Women over 75 should only be screened if they are in otherwise good health, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZPTADVPOBBGBLCGFHAV5KC56BY"&gt;Because mammograms are not perfect, other imaging studies have been studied. An MRI is the most sensitive but has a high risk of false positives (in the best case, 8% to 13%). An MRI is only recommended for those who are at a high risk of breast cancer (greater than 20%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="54OU7C3T3FCXVILYEHZLAHZBFI"&gt;A sonogram (also called an ultrasound) is a very reasonable test to get in addition to 3-D mammography for women with an intermediate risk and dense breast tissue. It’s my recommendation for my own patients; I offer but don’t insist on sonograms to women of average or low risk who have dense breast tissue, and some women will choose to get the scan while others will not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RRXWLQQS4NC75LJT3TXD64O4KI"&gt;Biomarkers (blood tests) may eventually become a useful part of screening, but I don’t recommend them outside of a clinical trial. Multiple studies on self-exams haven’t shown a benefit, but I have had some women physician and nurse patients who are expert examiners. They do self-exams that may be beneficial, but as you say, cysts can make these difficult to interpret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRJI3BUMM5EXNB2XTTLEAU57NY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

However, when high doses of acetaminophen are taken, or if glutathione levels are low from factors like &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-aa5e1f00-5784-11f0-8c41-85aceef8cdd2"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; use or malnutrition, the liver's capacity to process and eliminate NAPQI becomes overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When NAPQI is not properly detoxified, it can accumulate in the liver and bind to essential cellular proteins, leading to cell injury and potentially liver failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A top doctor has warned how a common medication could cause lasting damage in the long-term, with organ failure and dementia being among the side effects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Melillo says the risk of liver damage increases significantly when the dose of acetaminophen exceeds 4,000mg daily in adults. This equates to more than eight Tylenol PM pills. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;He highlights that acetaminophen is an ingredient in many medicines, not just Tylenol PM, so he recommends checking to see which products contain it and the quantities. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;He doesn't recommend against acetaminophen completely but says it should be used sparingly and not habitually. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says the prevalence of it is one of the reasons why there is so much liver damage in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver disease in some form affects one in three Americans, adding up to 100million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In January 2011, the FDA asked manufacturers of combination drugs containing acetaminophen to limit acetaminophen doses to no more than 325 mg in each tablet or capsule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because there's no data showing that taking more than 325 mg per dosage unit provides additional benefit while outweighing the increased risk of liver injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the recommendations, each Tylenol PM tablet contains 500 mg of acetaminophen to relieve pain and 25 mg diphenhydramine to help you go to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research also found that acetaminophen could &lt;span&gt;alter the perception of risk by making certain activities seem less dangerous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants in the study ingested two acetaminophen tablets (1,000 mg) of the drug or a placebo and were asked to rate certain activities based on risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those under the influence of the of the drug rated activities like bungee jumping, skydiving or starting a new career in your mid-30s as less risky than those who took the placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 2020 study, conducted by The Ohio State University, built on previous work that determined acetaminophen impacts the user's psychosis, as it was found to reduce positive and negative emotions, such as hurt feelings, concern of other's suffering and even their own joy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Melillo also dislikes Tylenol PM for its other main ingredient, diphenhydramine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is an antihistamine, which means it blocks histamine, a chemical in the body that promotes wakefulness, leading to drowsiness and helping with sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Melillo says that most people will be more familiar with the medication by its brand name, Benadryl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Explaining why he isn't a fan of diphenhydramine, he said it could 'possibly cause memory loss.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diphenhydramine is an anticholinergic medication, meaning it blocks the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is essential for memory and cognitive function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It is one of America's top-selling nighttime painkillers and it grosses sales close to $1 billion each year. But Dr Melillo warns that the over-the-counter (OTC) medication designed to provide temporary relief from occasional headaches and minor aches and pains is 'misused' by many patients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By blocking its action, diphenhydramine can impair these functions, leading to memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study found that taking an anticholinergic for the equivalent of three years or more on a daily basis was associated with a 54 percent higher dementia risk than taking the same dose for three months or less. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The other side effects of diphenhydramine, Dr Melillo says, include dry mouth and urinary retention (an inability to empty the bladder).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says for older patients, these symptoms can prove particularly troublesome as they could trigger other age-related health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If people need help sleeping, the pharmacist advises talking to a doctor about prescription medications that are available instead of turning to Tylenol PM or Benadryl, which they could become dependent upon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He adds: 'If you're someone who takes this on a blue moon, then that's fine, it's not a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But this should not be your go to medication for sleep every night... because you're gonna want to prevent long term complications.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 12:50:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxQTUx6YzhTWXFITEgwZDM2NWlvb2xsQWdMV1FwZUZzLU9tVHp2aHp1RUEwVUE1SWNCOEhkSDFjOU5aLWtxUUJydmdoT2NWTzE2SXQ3WHNkd1o2SHZDRVF0NW9qdU5MNk5kYldxYkRRUEhabUUzWnp5VW1JaWJ5bjBsZDZBOHFKdkVxc0NQVnpURWtVVDjSAZgBQVVfeXFMTnhaUExEQlYzb0xaU0JRN2hMTFlveWVwcDhiRlotWFhtc3cxLTZ4ZUZmTGptWDI1RkhCWVdUdTN2cURfT2dHOFZpU0pQZnZMeEpaOTNYOUYxTUJhZXhCMk5TWE5pX3ZCWkREX1FIb19qbUZub3NCRGtBb2R0OVBNY1B6NkNDQU8yeEtRRlRSRUNXTl91TFM1MGs</guid></item><item><title>肯塔基州麻疹爆发加剧了幼儿园儿童的恐惧-新闻 | Kentucky Measles Outbreak Raises Fear for Kindergarteners - Newser</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxOQXVOdlA5OFViU2N6Qi0zUndEenprZ1dLQnRwczU4eGZRQ3ZSYTdYSU5yRktSREJGcWFZc3I0eWYyeUctRHFUc1BIRFlQUERrRXZkQTRFdHRybFVEZ3BxdE96d1VYcnFZc1VZUjNfOEtuamRNWlpUcXBlRUkyazVGYi1Cc0N3a1FPdEtrWnIyUlVsUUhoVEFXT05IbGNpelU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="divStoryBodyAbove"&gt;

                                        A measles outbreak has emerged in central Kentucky. There are four confirmed cases: Three were confirmed in Woodford County before a fourth emerged in nearby Fayette County, per &lt;a href="https://www.wkyt.com/2025/06/30/officials-announce-measles-outbreak-central-kentucky/"&gt;WKYT&lt;/a&gt;. The Kentucky Department of Public Health has also reported a confirmed measles exposure in Jessamine County. Officials say one measles case confirmed in Todd County last week is not related to the outbreak. Kentucky's total measles cases for the year is now at 7. Six cases occurred in people who were unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown, with one appearing in an individual with just one dose of the two-dose measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, which is 97% effective against preventing infection.

                                        A dozen US states are experiencing active measles outbreaks, involving three or more related cases. Major outbreaks are occurring in Texas, New Mexico, in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Alberta, and in Chihuahua, Mexico. Texas confirmed three more cases on Tuesday, bringing its total to 753, though fewer than 10 are actively infectious, per the &lt;a href="https://www.newser.com/article/e5d928e41fd6b3dc6ade087662d61c5c/kentucky-confirms-measles-outbreak-as-us-nears-its-highest-case-count-in-more-than-30-years.html"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt;. New Mexico had counted 94 cases as of Friday. Officials in Kentucky are especially concerned because the vaccination rate among kindergartners is below 87%, compared to the national average of 93%, per &lt;a href="https://www.wtvq.com/health-officials-warn-of-measles-exposure-risk-in-central-kentucky-as-outbreak-grows/"&gt;WTVQ&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. Steven Stack, Kentucky's secretary for Health and Family Services, notes one infected person can spread measles to up to 18 others who are unvaccinated, so "the message is real simple: Get vaccinated."

    &lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What is our immune system?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people will be able to tell you where their &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/gut-health/"&gt;digestive system&lt;/a&gt; is, where the brain is, where their lungs are,” Dr Macciochi notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immune system, meanwhile, is a harder concept to grasp. It’s made up of hundreds of different types of cells and signalling molecules, controlled by around 8,000 genes – making it the second-most complicated system in our body, after our brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than being in one place, it’s located throughout our bodies. Around 70 per cent of the immune system is found in our digestive tract while the rest ranges from the skin’s surface to our bone marrow, as well as from brain to big toe. “It’s a testament to how important it is,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How has it been misunderstood?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m trying to get people to stop just thinking about their immune system for colds and flus,” Dr Macciochi says. Protecting us from bugs is one of its key roles, however. It’s why immune cells line the entry points to our bodies – the eyes, nose and mouth – which are coated in a defensive mucus that aims to catch viruses and bacteria before they can travel deeper into our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve always looked at the immune system through the lens of infection, which became less relevant in a country like the UK in the last 50 years because we have antibiotics, we have vaccines and we have public health measures that means we’re not dying from antibiotics, diphtheria and measles,” Dr Macciochi notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, our immune system is also working in other ways to keep us well, Dr Macciochi notes. It monitors and eliminates potential &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cancer/"&gt;cancer cells&lt;/a&gt;, protects against autoimmune disorders and manages our response to allergens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It even plays a role in chronic diseases, as inflammation, which is triggered by the immune system, is thought to be a driving force in heart disease, diabetes, cancer and dementia, she notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How is our immune system linked with longevity?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immune system is what has kept the human species alive for hundreds of thousands of years by triggering an inflammatory response when we become infected with a virus or bacteria. “It makes the body a hostile environment for a germ, so you can kill the germ and get rid of it,” Dr Macciochi explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this inflammatory response is being triggered too often as a result of our modern lifestyles that typically consists of a poor quality diet, frequent exposure to pollutants and mental stress, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s sending danger signals to our immune system but the danger isn’t a real danger and it’s not acute, it’s like constant, tiny hits,” Dr Macciochi says. The result is “inflammageing” which is the low-level, unwanted inflammation that builds up over time. “It’s like rust on a car” and fuels the onset of non-communicable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Inflammation will happen anyway – there’ll be a gradual increase with age, just like everything wears out with time,” she notes. “I don’t think we can make ourselves invincible to that but we can definitely push back on this slow burn of chronic inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research into the hallmarks of ageing has shown that inflammation accelerates them all, Dr Macciochi says. “The telomeres on the end of our chromosomes, which are protective tips, inflammation accelerates wearing that down. The mitochondria in our cells, which are these little energy battery packs, the inflammation makes them less efficient.” It also contributes to DNA damage, which can drive the growth of cancer, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In all of these systems, inflammation puts this extra burden on top of them, so they have to work harder and then over time you get the wear and tear effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Four habits to boost your immune system and increase your lifespan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the UK, we live on average to 80, which is amazing, compared to 150 years ago when you’d be lucky to get to 50,” Dr Macciochi says. “We’ve had an amazing longevity revolution already.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the average Brit has a health span of 60, meaning there are “20 years where, medically, we can keep you alive and functioning but your quality of life might not be very good”, she says. “You might be on multiple medications and then medications to treat the side effects of those medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While our body’s system will decline with age, unhealthy lifestyles preclude us from engaging in the activities that keep us young, she says. Setting up good habits that support our immune system now can elongate the number of years we spend free from illness – these are the habits Dr Macciochi recommends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Do more exercise&lt;/h2&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Popular weight-loss drugs like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-ozempic-and-why-are-people-saying-its-a-sad-way-to-lose-weight"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/tirzepatide-subcutaneous-route/description/drg-20534045"&gt;Zepbound&lt;/a&gt; have revolutionized how we &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-simple-strategy-for-weight-loss-outperforms-daily-dieting-study-says"&gt;tackle obesity&lt;/a&gt;. But now, emerging reports about potential side effects have prompted a new investigation by UK health regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of people reported experiencing severe &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"&gt;pancreas&lt;/a&gt; problems after taking these drugs, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4ged0r1n3wo"&gt;the BBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK government is now asking anyone who's been affected to contact them. They are particularly interested in understanding whether genetic factors may predispose certain individuals to such severe reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always with health alerts, it's crucial to put this news into perspective. There's no clear evidence yet that these drugs are directly &lt;em&gt;causing&lt;/em&gt; pancreas damage. Their &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-vs-wegovy-the-risks-and-side-effects-of-semaglutide-drugs"&gt;known side effects&lt;/a&gt; are already well-documented and they remain approved as safe for use when prescribed and overseen by a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-alternative-ditches-the-needle-and-one-major-side-effect?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Ozempic Alternative Ditches The Needle And One Major Side Effect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that last part – doctor oversight – is vital: it's not safe to obtain these drugs through unofficial channels. Even if you can be sure you're getting what you asked for – which you can't – these medications &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weight-loss-drugs-like-ozempic-can-leave-lasting-damage-in-your-mouth"&gt;aren't right for everyone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that when &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/largest-covid-vaccine-study-ever-reveals-the-actual-health-risks-you-face"&gt;any medication is taken up by a large number of people&lt;/a&gt;, it will inevitably reach some who will experience health issues regardless of the drugs they're on, and rare adverse reactions will likely also occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the sheer number of reports of acute or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"&gt;chronic pancreatitis&lt;/a&gt; warrants further examination, and the cases so far involve up to 10 fatalities. The investigation is being managed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and Genomics England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectively, the drugs being looked at are known as GPL-1 (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1"&gt;glucagon-like peptide-1&lt;/a&gt;) receptor agonists, because they target cells in the body usually activated by the natural GLP-1 hormone, which controls blood sugar and appetite – hence why they're used for  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="166142" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166145" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166145" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/PancreasOrgan.jpg" alt="Pancreas organ" class="wp-image-166145 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/PancreasOrgan.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/PancreasOrgan-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166145" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Issues have been reported with pancreas conditions. (Sebastian Kaulitzki/Science Photo Library/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These medications can be split into two types: those based on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaglutide"&gt;semaglutide&lt;/a&gt; (such as Ozempic and Wegovy), and those based on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirzepatide"&gt;tirzepatide&lt;/a&gt; (including Mounjaro and Zepbound). The latter type also targets &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_inhibitory_polypeptide"&gt;glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide&lt;/a&gt; (GIP) receptors, as well as GLP-1 receptors, for a stronger effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, almost 400 reports of acute pancreatitis have been received from people using GLP-1 drugs such as Mounjaro, Wegovy, Ozempic, and liraglutide, as per &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/26/weight-loss-diabetes-jab-users-report-pancreas-problems"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly half of those, 181, involve the tirzepatide-based drug sold as Mounjaro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-genetic-risk-for-disease-can-be-changed-by-your-environment"&gt;Genetic risk&lt;/a&gt; is one of the factors being studied, which may mean some people are more prone to pancreatic issues. In the case of acute or chronic pancreatitis, this manifests itself as severe stomach pain that won't go away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those in the UK aged over 18, who have a strong adverse reaction to one of these weight loss and diabetes drugs &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/if-you-take-a-glp-1-medicine-and-have-been-hospitalised-by-acute-pancreatitis-the-yellow-card-biobank-wants-to-hear-from-you"&gt;are being asked to register&lt;/a&gt; their details on the &lt;a href="https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/"&gt;Yellow Card website&lt;/a&gt; (the official UK system for reporting issues with approved medications).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, you'll be asked to submit more information and a saliva sample, if you're chosen to take part in a study of GLP-1 drugs and pancreatic issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects of all medications have to be considered in relation to other factors, including existing health conditions, genetics, age, and sex. Even the most effective drugs can come &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/worlds-most-common-pain-relief-drug-may-induce-risky-behavior-study-finds"&gt;with risks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"GLP-1 medicines like Ozempic and Wegovy have been making headlines, but like all medicines there can be a risk of serious side effects," &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/if-you-take-a-glp-1-medicine-and-have-been-hospitalised-by-acute-pancreatitis-the-yellow-card-biobank-wants-to-hear-from-you"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; geneticist Matt Brown from Genomics England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe there is real potential to minimize these, with many adverse reactions having a genetic cause."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Percent of Americans polled by NPR/PBS/Marist who believe that democracy is "under serious threat" here: &lt;strong&gt;76%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Odds that the Fed will hold interest rates steady at its July 29-30 meeting, according to futures activity, compared with a 19% chance of a quarter-point rate cut: &lt;strong&gt;81%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Percent chance that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Extreme heat is no longer a rare event , it has become the new normal, no country is immune," according to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres: &lt;strong&gt;100%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Average daytime high temperature in July at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Four Corners&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;National Monument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;93F&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Year that Independence Day was made a formal federal holiday:&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1941&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Thursday Molly Ivins Moment:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Happy birthday, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;America&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;! Ye Olde Fourth of July rolls around again and finds the Great Nation in, frankly, a somewhat pissy mood. Lots of blame game, name-slinging and general unpleasantness. But there's always an upside. The vice president reports that if you go ahead and let fly with the f-word, it makes you feel better. Anything to get that fun Dick Cheney back to his usual sunny self, I always say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image-captioned width-md align-left"&gt;&lt;img alt="Molly Ivins" src="https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/826634/large/MollyIvins.jpg?1593636143" title="Molly Ivins"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;True, we seem to have had more halcyon national natal days, but if we ignore &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Iraq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; for the weekend, we should be able to celebrate our national heritage without punching each other in the eye.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;So let's salute all that makes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;America&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; special, starting with us, the people. Here's to all the musicians from country to hip-hop to rock to classical to jazz to folk to be-bop to &lt;em&gt;norteno&lt;/em&gt; to polka to reggae, and to all the fusion forms thereof. Here's to all the artists who get no respect—the washboard players and lute strummers, harmonica blowers and banjo pickers. Here's to their endless generosity in playing special benefits for retired musicians who are ill and have no health insurance, all over &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;America&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, every night. And here's to the great Ray Charles, bless his heart. May we all hear his version of "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;America&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; the Beautiful" this holiday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;—July 2004&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Puppy Pic of the Day: &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jessigrace.bsky.social/post/3lsp434krtc2i" target="_blank"&gt;Tis the season…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHEERS &lt;/strong&gt;to taking out the trash. Hey, everybody! Here's something that's as rare as a functioning MAGA brain cell: actual &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; abortion news. We take you now to Wisconsin where, if recent elections for justices on the state's highest court had swung a different way, we wouldn’t be reading this right now. But they didn't, so…&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/wisconsin-supreme-court-strikes-states-1849-total-abortion-ban-rcna216300" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wisconsin Supreme Court on Wednesday formally struck down an abortion ban from1849 that had technically retaken effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned federal abortion rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image-captioned align-left"&gt;&lt;img alt="Justice Rebecca Bradley listens during the oral arguments at the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 2019AP559, League of Women Voters v. Tony Evers, at the Wisconsin State Capitol in Madison, Wisconsin Wednesday, May 15, 2019.

&lt;figcaption&gt;MAGA Wisconsin justice Rebecca Bradley has a sad.&lt;br&gt;
And that gives me a happy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a 4-3 decision that came down along ideological lines, the court’s liberal majority affirmed a lower court ruling that overturned the 176-year-old ban and left in place a more recent law in Wisconsin allowing most abortions until about the 20th week of pregnancy. […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ruling is a win for abortion rights activists in the battleground state, where Democrats had put the issue at the forefront of many elections—including two races in 2023 and 2025 that recalibrated the state Supreme Court's ideological balance—in the years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To celebrate the good news, Wisconsin will now send everyone in the country a large chunk of their delicious cheddar cheese absolutely free. (But you'll have to buy your own crackers and summer sausage. Budget cuts.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JEERS &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;to idle hands. The dream of our illustrious commerce secretary Crack T. Whip to produce a thriving economy based on an army of middle class Americans screwing tiny screws into tiny screw holes in tiny iPhones 14 hours a day remains a "work" in progress. (See what I did there?) But he might want to step it up if today's employment report from the newly-named Federal Bureau Of Get To Work You Lazy Slackers matches &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/adp-jobs-report-june-2025.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what dropped in our laps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; yesterday:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private sector hiring unexpectedly contracted in June, payrolls processing firm ADP said Wednesday, in a possible sign that the economy may not be as sturdy as investors believe. […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image-captioned align-right"&gt;&lt;img alt="Down-Arrow.jpg" src="https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/843470/large/Down-Arrow.jpg?1597355263" title="Down-Arrow.jpg"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The new national seal of the United States.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private payrolls lost 33,000 jobs in June, the ADP report showed, the first decrease since March 2023. Economists polled by Dow Jones forecast an increase of 100,000 for the month. The May job growth figure was revised even lower to just 29,000 jobs added from 37,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The bulk of job losses came in service roles tied to professional and business services and health and education, according to ADP.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Today's government report drops at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;8:30 ET&lt;/span&gt;. Fearless prediction: the biggest gains will be in the previously-underperforming "American Concentration Camp Alligator Poop Scooper" sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHEERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;to Men and women in Black.  The now-hapless Secret Service (America eventually ruins everything) went to work this week in 1865.  Its original intent was to prevent the spread of counterfeit currency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It wasn't until after the McKinley assassination that the service began protecting the president.  Which reminds me: if you ever want to intimidate someone, just stare at them while talking into your wrist.  (The old lady across the street is now poppin' Prozac like candy...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BRIEF SANITY BREAK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;END BRIEF SANITY BREAK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHEERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;to greenbacks. In a famous first, during this week in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; 1785&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Congress agreed that the dollar would officially become&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;America&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;’s first “unit of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;currency.” Also during this week in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; 1785&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the American public agreed that the dollar would, in their households, officially become&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;America&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;’s first "endangered species."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;CHEERS &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;to today's edition of &lt;em&gt;Oops, Did We Do Thaaat???&lt;/em&gt;  Take a bow, boycotters. You have effectively rocked a very evil man back on his hooves. Via &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/tesla-sales-fell-13-months-anti-musk-sentiment-123409243" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABC News&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sales of Tesla electric cars fell 13% in the last three months as boycotts over Elon Musk's political views continue to keep buyers away, a significant development given expectations that anger with the company's billionaire CEO would have faded by now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The plunging sales add to growing signs that Musk's embrace of U.S. President Donald Trump and far-right politicians in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Europe&lt;/span&gt; has had a deep and enduring hit to the Tesla’s brand appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been today's edition of &lt;em&gt;Oops, Did We Do Thaaat???&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ten years ago in C&amp;amp;J: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 3, 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;CHEERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; to getting a second opinion.  The Commerce Department now says &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;that the first-quarter Gross Domestic Product fell far less (0.2% vs. 0.7%) than originally estimated, thanks to stronger numbers on consumer spending and exports.  But looking ahead, the financial experts all agree on one thing: the fate of this quarter is completely in your hands, lemonade stand kids.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And just one more…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;CHEERS&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;to blowing this popsicle stand. Every time you go outside on a clear night you’re doing yourself a grave disservice if you don’t look up and gasp as you realize that the universe up there is pretty spectacular. The elves at NASA are also aware of this, so they always let us in on the big celestial events for the month. Here’s a look at July’s skywatching tips, including hot planet-on-planet action and the eagle’s awe-inspiring wingspan:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="AlignRight"&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And if there are any benevolent societies out there in the cosmos reading this who are good at solving problems on planets inhabited by self-immolating halfwits:&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Help!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a nice Thursday. Floor's open...What are you cheering and jeering about today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today's Shameless C&amp;amp;J Testimonial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This is just the beginning of our expanding coalition to make the &lt;em&gt;Cheers and &lt;/em&gt;Jeers kiddie pool swimmable. And we will do it together."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/07/01/zohran-mamdani-nyc-mayor-democratic-primary-election/84427903007/" target="_blank"&gt;Zohran Mamdani&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
