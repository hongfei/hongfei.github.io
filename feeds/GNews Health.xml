class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Scientists at Northwestern University in the US have found the brew removes charged atoms, or ions, of heavy metals from water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Benjamin Shindel, the first author of the research, said that while scientists might consider whether the flavour chemicals in tea were driving associated health benefits, the new study suggested an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I think the one possible better explanation might be that it’s because it’s removing metals from water,” he said, adding the team found a cup of black tea brewed for five minutes reduced the concentration of lead ions in water by about 15%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;While the team did not test the possible ramifications for health, Shindel said that even in a country such as the UK, where lead levels in drinking water are unlikely to be high, there could be a small effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It’s possible that on the margins, tea consumption is reducing [people’s] metal intake by a very small amount, and perhaps over the population of the UK, that’s reducing diseases associated with metal consumption by another commensurately very small amount,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Among other studies, previous research has suggested people who drink tea may have&lt;a

&lt;a

data-link-name="in body link"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsfoodscitech.4c01030" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ACS Food Science &amp;amp; Technology&lt;/a&gt;, Shindel and colleagues reported how they brewed tea with different batches of water containing known concentrations of heavy metal ions. They then checked the concentration of these ions after different periods of steeping, using solutions without tea as controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Working with black tea, they found the brew reduced the concentration of all the metal ions tested, including lead, chromium and cadmium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;They then focused on lead, finding longer brewing times of black tea and higher temperatures of water were associated with a greater reduction in the concentration of lead ions. What is more, ground tea had a greater effect than whole leaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The team also found that, at least for the batches they tested, black, green and white teas reduced the concentration of lead ions in the water to a greater degree than camomile, rooibos and oolong teas when left to steep for 24 hours to reach equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In the case of bagged tea, the materials also mattered, with empty cellulose bags found to reduce the concentration of lead ions, whereas empty cotton and nylon bags did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Prof Michelle Francl of Bryn Mawr College in the US and the author of Steeped: The Chemistry of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/tea" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Tea&lt;/a&gt;, who was not involved in the work, said: “If you are concerned about heavy metals in your water, don’t think that drinking tea is the solution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;However, she added that the study “suggests some interesting directions” for developing sustainable and accessible ways to “removing contaminants from water, a critical need in many parts of the world”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 12:14:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxNVUxRaGF2RGtoSVRpWHlVY0FJVC1yWVFCdUlBSGdzNElPc0FfNEtvOHB5enlwbWJKeWJKcTlMNHc4MkxWMFkyZ1FScVdPNTUwdlZ5cDNwc0hmaWFGcE1yN0JRczJ1U2FaU1dDb19mUlQ1b0VVZlJjTXppdEFrSGJmQkM2OS1mVUdsN2VJX0U0b1FGOU5NaVpr</guid></item><item><title>Mystery illness worries doctors after 50 people die in Congo within hours of symptoms - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxNSlZaUjZQRXRxS3B5VlRkb3BpVVY1WXNRRGlhb2Y3UkpqRFdxQTJTd2p5VnAzUzIzSzFzVWt3LW9BbmtEdUtNRWVHN2k3T2pkMFNkYThUTUU4eTk4NDVSRUlDVlBBZU5wZ01NOUM5MlJJd0dnVzBoeFpwTEEyWlprZ0hxY1NlMXdUSWhTSnBaRXd2SGFOeTFucmMwcWZWZDVYb2RYZlVMRHFEWC1URFE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 lkPksW sc-jbiisr-1 hiukpJ" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 cFynzd" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-0 eFDpwi"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 jkkqcL"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 dDFcwe"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 kqOtlp"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 bjQKsM"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 hWxisF sc-hez36s-16 gBaKpR"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 ifXxYf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 jlvSeZ"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 ghJHgZ"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 bhFQeV"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 gMxIQB"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

It’s even &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1911999117" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;true for most other mammals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“It’s a very robust phenomenon all over the world, totally conserved in sickness, during famines, during epidemics, even during times of starvation,” said Dr. Dena Dubal, a professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But the reasons women live longer are complicated and less established — and the fact that they are outliving men doesn’t necessarily mean they are &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/well/live/health-span-aging.html" title=""&gt;living better&lt;/a&gt;.

Is there a way to keep them from coming back?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It usually starts with a tingling at the edge of your lip. Painful, fluid-filled bumps emerge. Then they pop, ooze, scab over and eventually heal. Every few months, this cycle repeats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Cold sores, also known as fever blisters, can develop after infection with the herpes virus. (They’re commonly caused by a version of the virus called herpes simplex virus type 1, or HSV-1, which is different from the version that typically causes genital herpes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;For many, the lesions are “unsightly and painful,” said Dr. Christine Johnston, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Washington School of Medicine. They’re also common, she added: Roughly half of people in the United States have HSV-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Here’s how to treat cold sores, and whether you can prevent them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-4bec567b"&gt;What causes cold sores?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The herpes virus is “very contagious,” said Dr. Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UC Davis Health. You can pick it up through close contact with someone who is infected, such as through kissing or sharing food or drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;And it’s not always easy to tell whether someone is contagious, Dr. Blumberg said. People can transmit oral herpes without a visible cold sore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;If you do become infected, you might not develop a cold sore right away or even at all, Dr. Blumberg added. It could take years before you have an outbreak, Dr. Johnston said, or maybe you never get one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

The rock pigeon (Columba livia), from which most modern domestic and feral pigeons descend, originally nested in cliffs and rocky crevices in the wild. These environments required minimal nesting materials, as the natural terrain provided protection and support for eggs and chicks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As humans began to domesticate pigeons thousands of years ago, their nesting habits adapted to artificial environments like rooftops, buildings, and ledges that mimicked their natural cliffside habitats. Ancient civilizations, such as those in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Rome, raised pigeons for food, messages, and religious purposes, providing them with simple nesting spaces like dovecotes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over time, pigeons became less dependent on elaborate nest-building because human-provided shelters offered protection and reduced the need for sturdy nests. This historical reliance on natural and artificial shelters influenced their present-day nesting behavior, resulting in the minimalistic and "lazy" nests pigeons are known for today&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DErTD7PzriP" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-8/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249842"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starlings see each other using their exceptional ultraviolet (UV) vision, which allows them to perceive colors beyond what humans can see, meaning they likely see each other with enhanced markings and colors due to the way their feathers reflect UV light, giving them a different visual appearance compared to how we see them; essentially, they can see more detail and distinction between individuals in a flock than we can&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFYXsHZTU-L" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-3/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ELi5 Instagram page is fairly new, created only a year ago in February 2024. Yet it still has quite an impressive following of 518k. We could attribute it to people's love of learning new things; after all, 87% of American internet users &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2014/12/08/more-information-yields-more-learning-and-sharing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;do say&lt;/a&gt; that the World Wide Web has improved their ability to learn new things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept of "Explain it to me like I'm 5" isn't new either. The Reddit community of the same name has over 23 million members. The internet is peppered with similar online groups, podcasts, and YouTube shows. We love &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/topics/learning-new-things/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;learning new things&lt;/a&gt; when they're communicated in a simple, easy-to-understand language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249844"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the 2011 tsunami, scientists helping strawberry farmers in Japan salvage damaged crops accidentally discovered that liquid polyphenol extracted from the berries caused cream to solidify.

This innovative approach, known as “protein degradation,” uses a type of molecule called a PROTAC (proteolysis-targeting chimeras) to bind a disease-causing protein to another protein that tags it for destruction. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Essentially, it reprograms the cell’s machinery to remove harmful proteins selectively, triggering cancer cells to destroy themselves while sparing healthy cells. This technique is still being refined, but it represents a promising strategy for targeted cancer therapy, especially for cancers resistant to conventional treatments. 📸- Ella Maru Studio/ Stanford Medicene&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCn-wANPj4M" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-13/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249867"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is 12-hour time even taught? Wouldn’t it just be easier to remember 13:00 instead of 1:00pm? 12 hour time is a very ancient system that traces back to the Mesopotamian empires. They had a cultural fixation on the number 12, used a base-12 numerical system, and divided up most things into 12ths whenever possible - including day and night. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 12 hours of day and 12 hours of night system spread throughout Europe and the Middle East and has defied multiple attempts to change it over the centuries. Also for anyone curious why there was such a love of the number 12, it was because that was how they counted on their hand. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Look at your hand. Notice how each of your fingers minus your thumb has three easily identifiable parts to it. They used to count by using their thumb to count each part of the finger, much in the same way we count to 10 using our fingers today. So, 12 was the max you could count on one hand&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C_FV1atp_xs" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-28/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first encounter with complex &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/scary-science-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;science facts&lt;/a&gt; explained understandably for many Americans was probably the &lt;em&gt;Bill Nye the Science Guy &lt;/em&gt;series in their childhood. For many millennials and Gen Z, &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/topics/bill-nye/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;Bill Nye&lt;/a&gt; is still the go-to person when they think about learning about science in a fun and interesting way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The positive impact of Nye's show was also proved by researchers. They &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/12190/learning-science-in-informal-environments-people-places-and-pursuits" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that those who watched &lt;em&gt;Bill Nye the Science Guy &lt;/em&gt;regularly were better at explaining scientific ideas than non-viewers. There's also a trend that we tend to learn better overall in informal environments, be it a TV show or a simple Instagram page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249848"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil’s mysterious tunnels, known as paleoburrows, are massive underground structures found predominantly in the southern and southeastern regions of the country. These fascinating formations are believed to have been dug thousands of years ago by extinct giant ground sloths, some of which were the size of modern-day elephants. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Professor Heinrich Frank, a geologist from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, first encountered these tunnels during an expedition and was immediately struck by their sheer scale and the distinct claw marks etched into their walls, undeniable evidence of ancient megafauna activity. Frank’s research revealed that some of these tunnels stretch over 600 meters, with diameters wide enough to walk through. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He suggests that these burrows were likely created as shelters or protective spaces, though their exact purpose remains a mystery. Frank’s expeditions have also shed light on how these extinct creatures shaped their environment, showcasing their engineering capabilities. These paleoburrows provide a unique window into prehistoric ecosystems and underscore the significant role these massive creatures played in altering their habitats&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DEjs1s_zGIV" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-9/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249861"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1960, David Latimer planted a spiderwort sprout inside of a large glass jar, added a quarter pint of water, and then sealed it shut. He opened the bottle for the first time only 12 years later, in 1972, to add some water and then sealed it for good. The self-contained ecosystem flourished for more than 60 years as a perfectly balanced garden and self-sufficient ecosystem. The bacteria in the compost ate the dead plants and broke down the oxygen released, turning it into carbon dioxide, essentially forming a microcosm of Earth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAn84boTVTs" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-22/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249865"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third Man Syndrome is a curious psychological phenomenon where people in extreme, life-threatening situations, such as explorers, mountaineers, or disaster survivors, feel the presence of an invisible companion. This "third man" is often perceived as a calm, comforting figure who provides guidance, encouragement, and a sense of safety, even though no one is actually there. It’s not just a vague feeling; many describe this presence as real, almost like a guardian angel helping them through a critical moment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Imagine you're lost in the middle of a desert, exhausted and close to giving up. Suddenly, it feels like someone is walking alongside you, quietly encouraging you to keep moving, guiding your steps, even though you know you're physically alone. It’s as if your mind, under extreme stress, creates this "companion" to help you survive, similar to how we sometimes talk to ourselves for reassurance during tough times. In moments of intense fear or danger, the brain can conjure this supportive figure to help push through and keep going when survival feels impossible. It's the mind's way of creating a psychological lifeline when you need it most&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAVFowCTsve" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-26/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we call it "Explain it like I'm 5", we don't necessarily want things explained to us like we're literally five years old. It's about breaking concepts down to the very essentials;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/fact-tired-explaining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt; explaining things&lt;/a&gt; in such a manner so that a person with absolutely no background on the topic would be able to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249854"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study led by UCL and the Anna Freud Centre used fMRI scans to investigate the impact of family violence on children's brain activity. The research revealed that children exposed to domestic violence show heightened activation in the anterior insula and amygdala - regions associated with threat detection and anxiety - when viewing angry faces. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This neural response mirrors the brain activity found in soldiers exposed to combat, suggesting that both groups may become "hyper-aware" of danger due to their environments. These changes in brain functioning, although potentially adaptive in the short term, may increase the risk of developing anxiety disorders later in life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Eamon McCrory, lead author, notes that while none of the children studied had mental health issues at the time, their altered brain function could indicate an underlying risk factor. Professor Peter Fonagy, Chief Executive of the Anna Freud Centre, highlighted the importance of this research in raising awareness of the lasting impact of violence on children's brain development and in guiding clinical and social work practices. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings underscore the need for continued efforts to protect children from violence and to develop effective treatment strategies. The next research steps include investigating how stable these brain changes are and understanding the resilience mechanisms that help some children overcome early adversity&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCPVQKPz_2B" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-15/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249845"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In certain forests, when you look up you will see a network of cracks formed by gaps between the outermost edges of the tree branches. It looks like a precisely engineered jigsaw puzzle, each branch growing just perfectly so it almost - but not quite - touches the neighboring tree. This beautiful phenomenon is called crown shyness. Crown shyness doesn’t happen all the time, and scientists aren’t completely certain why it happens at all. There is some evidence that it most commonly occurs with similarly aged trees, especially stands of the same species. But it can occur in any forest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFKDR7pTeJx" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-6/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249862"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically, when you are standing, blood flow slows and "pools" in your legs due to gravity. But when you walk, your muscles contract and push the blood in your veins and vessels back up into your upper body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the side note, seasoned military personnels are able to stand at ease for long periods of time because they are actually swaying back and forth very slowly in micro-movements to contract their muscles and relieve the tingling and numb sensation you get when you keep standing for long periods of time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAlFkFiTIjC" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-23/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who use the ELI5 principle most often are science communicators. As Kelly Tabbutt, the visiting assistant professor of sociology at the Oberlin College and Conservatory &lt;a href="https://fancycomma.substack.com/p/eli5-explain-it-to-me-like-im-five" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt;, there are a lot of similarities between elementary education and communicating science to the general public. In both contexts, people avoid jargon, use uncomplicated real-world examples, and present the information in an entertaining manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249863"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 9,000-year-old skeleton, nicknamed Cheddar Man, was discovered in Gough's Cave in Cheddar, England. This ancient skeleton, one of the oldest ever found in Britain, has provided a fascinating glimpse into early human history. DNA analysis revealed that Cheddar Man had dark skin, blue eyes, and dark, curly hair, challenging previous assumptions about the appearance of early Europeans. Even more astonishing, scientists found a living relative of Cheddar Man residing just half a mile away, tracing the lineage back nearly 300 generations. This discovery underscores the deep ancestral connections between ancient populations and modern-day descendants, highlighting the continuity of human history in specific geographic regions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAecPVWORu9" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-24/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249843"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood Falls is a strange and fascinating natural phenomenon in Antarctica where bright red water seeps out from a glacier, making it look like the ice is bleeding. It flows from the Taylor Glacier in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, one of the coldest and driest places on Earth. At first glance, it seems like the red color might be due to algae or some other living organisms, but the real reason is actually hidden deep below the glacier. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The science behind Blood Falls lies in its salty, iron-rich water. About 2 million years ago, a small body of water got trapped under the glacier, cut off from sunlight and oxygen. Over time, the water absorbed a lot of iron from the surrounding rocks. Because there's no oxygen, the iron stays dissolved in the water, just like iron in an old rusty pipe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the water finally escapes and reaches the surface, it comes into contact with oxygen in the air, causing the iron to oxidize and turn red, just like rust. This reaction is what gives Blood Falls its eerie, blood-like color. Despite the extreme conditions, scientists have also discovered tiny microbes living in the water, proving that life can exist even in some of the harshest places on Earth&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFdZPDrznHT" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-4/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249853"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tokyo has seen an 84% decrease in suicides at train stations where blue LED lights were installed. First introduced in 2009 on the Yamanote line, these lights were part of a broader initiative to address the city’s high s*****e rates. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The calming effect of blue light on mood is thought to play a role, as well as the lights’ strategic positioning on platforms. Alongside the lights, Tokyo also implemented automatic gates and barriers on train platforms to deter attempts, as well as improved counseling services like the “Inochi no Denwa” hotline. Additional steps include government-funded programs aimed at reducing suicides by 20% from 2005 levels. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This includes investigating the root causes of s*****e and working to shift cultural attitudes. These interventions are costly, but they have contributed to a recent drop in s*****e rates, showing some progress in Tokyo’s ongoing efforts to address this complex issue.

This rare event caused lagoons of water to appear in regions that had been dry for decades. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rainfall was triggered by a combination of factors, including the northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which typically stays closer to the equator. Warm ocean waters, converging winds, and strong sunlight created the perfect conditions for this significant rainfall. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In places like Tagounite, more than a third of the annual average rainfall fell in just 24 hours. The heavy rain filled dried lake beds and desert areas, creating temporary pools and rivers that haven't been seen for years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scientists suggest that climate change and shifts in atmospheric patterns may have contributed to this anomaly. The rains are helping replenish groundwater sources, but also caused floods and damage in rural areas&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DA_cAyvzCQg" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s89nBXauLSY" target="_blank"&gt; WION / Youtube &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-18/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249850"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When helicopters operate in sandy environments, the downward thrust of their rotors kicks up clouds of sand. As the blades cut through, the hard sand erodes the abrasion-resistant titanium or nickel coatings, releasing fine metal particles. These fragments ignite due to heat and their pyrophoric nature, producing the fiery Kopp-Etchells Effect. The Kopp-Etchells Effect was named in honor of two soldiers, Benjamin S. Kopp (U.S. Army) and Joseph Etchells (U.K. Army), who died in Afghanistan in July 2009. The term was coined by Michael Yon, a former Green Beret and independent combat journalist 📸- Michael Yon/X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDMmxOPTQhy" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-11/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249871"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was some concern that cell phones might interfere with communication by the pilots but that is proven to not be an issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However cell towers mainly point their antenna at the ground because that is where the people tend to be. When you are flying you will be changing cell tower zones very quickly and it will be very difficult for your cell phone to talk to them, if it can reach them at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a result your phone will tend to crank up its transmitter to maximum power and basically scream into the void searching for a signal, burning battery power and producing as much radio noise as allowable. Since you know it won't work right it is best practice to turn on airplane mode so it won't do that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Plus there is a marginal increase in the risk that if a battery problem in a phone was going to happen, thrashing it in such a manner might tend to kick it off right then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8PcbpKoiS1" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-32/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-18"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's why, in the past, Gates tried to make his presentations about public health, renewable energy, and environmental issues as memorable and entertaining as possible. When speaking about the effects of malaria, he famously &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/bill-gates-releases-mosquitoes-audience-flna1c9455619" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;released mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt; into the crowd.

And when he presented the Janicki Omniprocessor that can purify wastewater, he shocked people by &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/01/10/376182321/bill-gates-raises-a-glass-to-and-of-water-made-from-poop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;drinking&lt;/a&gt; a glass of 'poop water.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249877"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;KAIST researchers, led by Professor Kwang-Hyun Cho, have introduced a revolutionary approach to treating colon cancer by reprogramming cancer cells into a normal-like state instead of destroying them. Traditional cancer treatments aim to eliminate cancer cells, but they often lead to resistance, recurrence, and severe side effects due to damage to healthy cells. This new method offers a promising alternative by addressing cancer without causing harm to surrounding tissues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The research team focused on the concept that during cancer development, normal cells regress along their differentiation pathway. To better understand this process, they developed a digital twin model of the gene network that controls normal cell differentiation. Through simulation analysis, they identified key molecular switches capable of pushing cancer cells back into a normal-like state. When applied to colon cancer cells, these switches successfully reversed their malignant characteristics, a breakthrough confirmed through molecular experiments and animal studies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This study highlights the potential for "reversible cancer therapy," a novel concept where cancer cells can be reprogrammed rather than eradicated. Unlike conventional treatments that rely on trial-and-error drug discoveries, this approach systematically identifies key targets using computational models. The findings suggest that similar techniques could be applied to other types of cancer, opening new avenues for safer and more effective treatments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study, co-authored by Jeong-Ryeol Gong, Chun-Kyung Lee, Hoon-Min Kim, Juhee Kim, and Jaeog Jeon, was published in Advanced Science on December 11.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source - KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/explainlikeimfivee/p/DGJC-tNTe61/?img_index=1" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-38/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249866"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are lucky enough to survive a lightning strike, in addition to the physical and psychological consequences, you will see a kind of tree or root-shaped tattoo on your body: lightning flowers. These are generated when a body that does not conduct electricity receives a high electric charge. Lightning flowers, also known as Lichtenberg figures, are produced when the capillary vessels under the skin break due to the lightning discharge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The appearance or shape we see would mark the path and degree of absorption of the lightning. These natural “tattoos” do not last a lifetime, they only appear for a few hours or days until they disappear completely. It should be noted that these figures can also appear in places where lightning strikes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although it is not very common, there are occasions in which they have been observed in grassy areas where lightning has struck, such as golf courses or soccer stadiums. These figures were discovered by the German scientist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg in 1977, after whom they are named. The so-called lightning flowers had such peculiar ramifications that they generated great interest and began to be studied. Nature is as beautiful as it is dangerous. That is why every precaution is too little when faced with natural phenomena such as a thunderstorm&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAOGgOOuBQ7" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-27/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249858"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hurricanes form when warm ocean water heats the air above it, causing that air to rise quickly. As the warm air rises, it creates an area of low pressure below, pulling in cooler air to replace it. This cycle of warm air rising and cooler air filling in beneath starts to create strong winds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the winds pick up, the storm begins to rotate due to the Earth's rotation (Coriolis effect). The storm grows in power, drawing in more moisture and heat from the ocean, and eventually becomes a hurricane when wind speeds exceed 74 mph. The key ingredients for hurricane formation are warm ocean waters (at least 26.5°C or 80°F), moist air, and favorable wind conditions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the storm intensifies, it forms a characteristic "eye" in the center, which is surrounded by a dangerous eyewall where the strongest winds and rain occur. Hurricanes can bring heavy rains, storm surges (where ocean water is pushed onto land), and damaging winds that cause widespread destruction. Hurricane Milton, currently one of the strongest storms in 2024, follows this same process. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has grown to a Category 5 hurricane, with wind speeds reaching up to 180 mph. The storm formed over the warm waters of the Atlantic and rapidly intensified. It is now threatening Florida with life-threatening winds, storm surges, and flooding. Authorities have issued evacuation orders as Milton approaches the coast, expecting it to bring significant destruction across a wide area&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DA5hHDwz6Ms" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-19/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-21"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no shame in admitting you don't understand complex scientific concepts and need them explained simply. Astrophysicist and science communicator extraordinaire Carl Sagan &lt;a href="https://www.humanelementcommunications.com/insights/keep-it-simple-carl-sagans-science-communication-advice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in his 1994 book &lt;em&gt;The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Handle in the Dark&lt;/em&gt; about the importance of clearly communicating difficult subjects to the general public. "Don’t talk to the general audience as you would your scientific colleagues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249860"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it's a shortcut, a simplified system created by scribes who had to write a lot by hand. So these scribes (some of them were monks) discovered that instead of raising the pen from the paper over and over again to write a new, separated letter, it was easier and faster to keep a continuous line that flows tying one letter to the next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This system, called cursive, works great for some of the Latin letters, but not for most of them which had to be adapted. This is why A, B, E F, G, H, I, L, M, N, Q, R and sometimes S look very different in cursive from their uppercase versions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This cursive system was later adapted by printers as the lowercase fonts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAwGa35T8Qe" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/cropped-side-view-schoolgirl-sitting-outdoors_7337899.htm#fromView=search&amp;amp;page=2&amp;amp;position=26&amp;amp;uuid=ad6475f4-7ede-4fd4-ac54-7a45b38fd097&amp;amp;query=handwriting+alphabet+poster" target="_blank"&gt; drobotdean / freepik &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-21/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249864"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dina Sanichar, often called the "real-life Mowgli," was a boy discovered in 1867 by hunters in the jungles of Uttar Pradesh, India. When found, he was living with a pack of wolves and behaving like one of them - walking on all fours, growling, and eating raw meat. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The hunters brought him to the Sikandra Mission Orphanage, where caretakers tried to help him adapt to human life. However, Dina never fully adjusted; he struggled with basic human skills like speaking, using utensils, or wearing clothes. Though he learned to walk upright and eat cooked food, he remained largely silent and withdrawn. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His story, along with accounts of other "feral children" found in the wild, is believed to have inspired Rudyard Kipling's famous character Mowgli in *The Jungle Book*, who was also raised by wolves. Dina’s life showcases the profound impact of early life experiences on human development and the challenges of reintegrating into society after living in the wild. His existence reflects the thin line between human and animal behavior and how environment shapes who we are&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAaZdIHTNgv" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-25/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249869"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armpit sweat glands are known as apocrine sweat glands, and instead of just sweat, they also produce a mix of proteins and lipids.&lt;br&gt;The bacteria on your skin love that stuff and eat it up, producing waste products in the process.

"&lt;em&gt;Use the simplest possible language&lt;/em&gt;," he wrote. "Above all, remember how it was before you, yourself, grasped whatever it is you're explaining."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249870"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;4WD and AWD roughly do the same thing but in different ways, the car is proving power to all four of its wheels. The difference is how that power is &amp;gt; divided between them. An AWD car can allow each wheel to turn at a different rate, while a 4WD car generally has its wheel all turning at the same rate.&lt;br&gt;This 4WD set up is better for offroad driving, but can cause problems in city driving, where the inside wheels need to turn slower around a corner than the outside wheels do. Because of this, a lot of 4WD cars are designed to be able to switch to rear-wheel drive when the 4WD is not needed&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8eoz2FI6lR" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-31/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249878"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that carrots dramatically improve eyesight, especially night vision, is actually a myth that started during World War II. The British Royal Air Force spread this rumor to hide the real reason their pilots had improved night-fighting abilities—radar technology. They claimed that pilots ate a lot of carrots, which helped them see enemy planes better at night. This clever propaganda misled enemies and also popularized the idea that eating carrots could significantly boost vision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, while carrots don’t give you super eyesight, they do contain beta-carotene, a type of pigment that the body converts into vitamin A. Vitamin A is essential for eye health because it helps maintain the retina, particularly the part responsible for seeing in low light (the rod cells). A deficiency in vitamin A can lead to night blindness, but consuming more than the necessary amount doesn’t give you enhanced vision beyond normal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, while eating carrots can help prevent vision problems related to vitamin A deficiency, they won’t give you night-vision superpowers. The best way to keep your eyes healthy is a balanced diet with a variety of nutrients, not just relying on carrots!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/explainlikeimfivee/p/DGGZklBTyGP/" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-39/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249849"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Happens When You Hold in a Fart? Clare Collins, a professor of nutrition and dietetics at the University of Newcastle, explains that holding in a fart can cause intestinal gas to build up, leading to abdominal distension. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of this gas may be reabsorbed into the bloodstream and exhaled through your breath. If held in too long, the gas will eventually escape as an uncontrollable fart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Research is unclear on whether this increases the risk of conditions like diverticulitis or has no significant impact. Studies also show that a high-fiber diet, like one including baked beans and psyllium, leads to fewer but larger farts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For digestive health, the best approach is simple: when you feel the need to pass gas, find a private spot and let it go. Holding it in does more harm than good&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DEhPQkDv3JE" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-10/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-27"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brain-Rules-Updated-Expanded-Principles/dp/098326337X?tag=vilofjoy-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;Brain Rules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, molecular biologist John Medina claims that we learn better when there are visual stimuli accompanying an explanation. If we add visuals to our explanation, the retention rate increases from 10% (audio only) to 65% (audio and visuals). This includes photographs, illustrations, physical props, infographics, videos, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249868"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of finger joints on each hand (excluding the thumb) makes it possible to count to 12 by using the thumb.

A recent study found that young adults who ate a handful of walnuts in the morning had quicker reaction times and improved memory throughout the day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is because walnuts contain brain-friendly nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and polyphenols, which help improve cognitive function. Unlike short-term stimulants like caffeine, walnuts support brain health in a more natural and lasting way. Adding them to your diet could enhance focus, learning, and mental performance over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/explainlikeimfivee/p/DGZ5tWYzUwr/" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-33/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249879"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ulnar dimelia, also known as "Mirror Hand Syndrome," is an extremely rare congenital anomaly where the forearm and hand structures are duplicated symmetrically.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This condition is characterized by the absence of the radius bone, which is one of the two main bones in the forearm, and instead, there is a duplication of the ulna, the other forearm bone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a result, individuals with this condition typically have an abnormal number of fingers—usually seven or eight—without a functional thumb. This mirror-like duplication leads to a unique but non-functional hand structure, often requiring surgical intervention to improve functionality. While the exact cause of ulnar dimelia is not fully understood, it is believed to be linked to disruptions in early limb development during fetal growth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Due to its rarity, cases of mirror hand syndrome provide valuable insights into limb formation and genetic regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/explainlikeimfivee/p/DF-4Ix4z6ES/?img_index=1" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-40/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-30"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough," theoretical physicist Albert Einstein said.

Goliath was much larger than the average American bullfrog tadpole, making it a unique case for researchers to study. Normally, tadpoles undergo metamorphosis to become froglets, a process controlled by thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). However, when there is a hormonal imbalance, this transformation can be disrupted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If a tadpole lacks the gene that produces thyroxine, it cannot metamorphose into a frog. In some cases, developmental hormones may be turned off or reduced, while growth hormones may be excessively active, leading to abnormal size without proper development. Unfortunately, Goliath died in 2019, and researchers suspect that his extreme size was a result of this hormonal imbalance. They were investigating the underlying causes of his unusual condition to better understand similar cases in amphibians.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;📸 - Earyn McGee/SWRS/The Frog Conservation Project&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/explainlikeimfivee/p/DFvaSGYzkb0/?img_index=1" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-42/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249882"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An armadillo's armor is much more than just tough skin; it is actually a separate bone structure that sits on top of their skeleton. This bony shell acts like a natural armor, protecting the armadillo from predators. The structure is made of bony plates, known as "scutes," that are attached to the armadillo’s body, providing both strength and flexibility to move. This unique feature helps armadillos survive in the wild, allowing them to roll up into a ball for extra protection against threats.

Likely belonging to a juvenile coelurosaur, this specimen offers an exceptional glimpse into the Cretaceous period, showcasing not only bones but also feathers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The preservation of feathers in such detail allows scientists to study their structure and color like never before. Amber preserved delicate features that would have otherwise decayed in traditional fossils, including the fine arrangement of feathers resembling those of modern birds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This discovery provides valuable insights into the evolution of feathers, shedding light on their roles in thermoregulation, display, or flight. Along with the tail, plant debris and a Cretaceous-era ant were also preserved, offering a rare snapshot of the ecosystem from that time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This find is crucial for understanding the morphology and habitat of feathered dinosaurs, bridging the evolutionary gap between dinosaurs and birds. 📸- R.C.

The patient had no comorbidities, and his colonoscopy prep involved drinking a gallon of polyethylene glycol, a powerful laxative used to clean the colon. This prep may have helped the ladybug avoid being broken down by stomach acids and digestive enzymes, allowing it to make the full journey through the digestive system. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doctors think the bug, identified as "Harmonia axyridis", a multicolored Asian ladybug introduced to North America for pest control, entered the man’s body while he was asleep. Though it’s rare for insects to be ingested, it does happen occasionally. How this ladybug survived the entire trip is a mystery, and the case study published in the "AGC Case Reports Journal" doesn’t confirm whether the bug made it out alive.

Studies have found that surgeons who play video games for at least three hours a week work 27% faster and make 37% fewer mistakes compared to those who don’t.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is because video games, especially those that require precision and quick reflexes, improve hand-eye coordination, reaction time, and fine motor skills—all of which are essential for surgery. Many modern surgeries, like laparoscopic procedures, require surgeons to control tiny instruments while looking at a screen, similar to playing a game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additionally, gaming improves problem-solving skills, focus, and the ability to make quick decisions, which are crucial during high-pressure operations. While playing video games alone won’t make someone a great surgeon, it can certainly sharpen the skills needed for delicate medical procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/explainlikeimfivee/p/DGONVnuzfzq/" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-36/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249880"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Earth might feel massive to us, but compared to the Sun’s powerful solar flares, it’s tiny. A typical solar flare can extend thousands of kilometers into space, and the largest ones can be more than 10 times the diameter of Earth! To put it in perspective, if Earth were the size of a grape, a massive solar flare would be like a fiery explosion bigger than a basketball. These flares release immense energy—sometimes equivalent to millions of nuclear bombs exploding at once—showing just how small and fragile our planet is in the face of the Sun’s power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/explainlikeimfivee/p/DF0wNvzz_cP/" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-41/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249846"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have discovered a 300-million-year-old fossilized rainforest hidden deep beneath the surface in a coal mine in Illinois, USA.

The fossils were located nearly 100 meters below the surface at the Riola and Vermilion Grove mines in Vermilion County, Illinois. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The forest was encased in mud 300 million years ago when a major earthquake or similar catastrophic event caused the entire area to abruptly sink below sea level. The ancient forest was preserved on a layer of coal, and when miners extracted the coal, the fossilized forest was revealed on the mine’s ceiling. 📸- Howard falcon-Lang&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFBHDvnTqgf" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/sendratoni/?fbclid=IwY2xjawIpSgFleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHTJ1tbgWqXeemtNO6zpe0Mn3gL-tVctYtWOc8RAFiVuHYnO0ByS9SGS-mg_aem_pGd6mh5u0P4MHLKzEo7LAw" target="_blank"&gt; Toni Sendra &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-7/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249851"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A remarkable discovery in Siberia has left scientists amazed: the mummified remains of a saber-toothed cat cub, belonging to the species Homotherium latidens. This specimen, preserved in the permafrost near the Badyarikha River, is over 35,000 years old and provides an extraordinary glimpse into this ice-age predator, with intact fur, skin, and paw pads. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The cub, estimated to be just three weeks old at death, offers valuable insights into its anatomy and hunting adaptations. Unlike modern lions, its robust forelimbs and larger jaws suggest reliance on strength and agility to subdue prey. The well-preserved body allows scientists to examine features such as shorter ears and a sturdier neck, pointing to unique evolutionary traits. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DNA analysis of this fossil could unravel critical details about saber-toothed cats’ lineage, which diverged from other felines around 18 million years ago. This discovery highlights the permafrost’s role in preserving ancient life and deepens our understanding of extinct species.

This means that Nepal's time is 5 hours and 45 minutes ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Most countries set their time zones in whole-hour increments, like UTC+5:00 or UTC+6:00, but Nepal is different because it uses a 45-minute offset instead of the usual 30-minute or 60-minute adjustments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This unusual time setting dates back to 1956, when Nepal decided to base its official time on the longitude of Mount Gaurishankar (east of Kathmandu) instead of its capital. This led to the extra 15-minute shift from the more common UTC+5:30, which countries like India and Sri Lanka follow. The decision reflects Nepal’s independence in setting its own time rather than following its neighbors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because of this, Nepal stands out as one of the few places in the world with a 45-minute time zone offset, making it a unique feature in global timekeeping. This difference can sometimes cause confusion when setting clocks, scheduling flights, or adjusting digital devices. However, for Nepal, this small but significant difference symbolizes its sovereignty and national identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/explainlikeimfivee/p/DGLn6xgzW9h/" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-37/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249883"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have discovered a 300-million-year-old fossilized rainforest hidden deep beneath the surface in a coal mine in Illinois, USA.

Studies have shown that when dogs poop, they often align their bodies along a north-south axis, meaning they prefer facing either toward the North or South while avoiding the East-West direction. Scientists believe dogs use this ability to stay oriented in their environment, just like birds and other animals that rely on the Earth's magnetosphere for navigation. This behavior is most noticeable when the Earth's magnetic field is calm and undisturbed. Though we don’t fully understand why dogs do this, it’s likely linked to their evolutionary instincts for survival and spatial awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/explainlikeimfivee/p/DGUzjPkT6kZ/" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-34/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8249874"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blushing is something only humans do, and it’s one of the most fascinating and unique reactions of our body. It happens when we feel embarrassed, shy, or even guilty. The reason behind this is tied to our emotions and how our body responds to them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we feel a strong emotion like embarrassment, our brain sends a signal to our body to release adrenaline. Adrenaline makes our blood vessels widen, especially in our face, which causes more blood to rush to the skin. This is why our cheeks turn red when we blush. It’s an automatic response, meaning we can’t control it, no matter how much we might want to!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scientists believe blushing is linked to human social behavior. It’s a way of showing others that we recognize a mistake or feel shy about something. In a way, it helps people trust us more because it signals honesty. Other animals may show emotions in different ways, but blushing is something only humans experience. It’s a reminder of how deeply connected our emotions and physical reactions are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.instagram.com/explainlikeimfivee/p/DGQx5k3TcSA/" target="_blank"&gt; explainlikeimfivee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/explain-complex-things-like-im-five-35/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Bored Panda</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 07:33:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFBPc2VhbVE0ZlYwQjlaVUlBQzMxUGh6djNndlFDUzZPWXpsWDAwTGd0amlUczFnY3hWcUxmNEtMa0lPX0tZUk94Q2xJYy1nYkg3S1d5cmhZVFdrOXhRc2dUdWwyZjkyc3lSU1BZQ0Q2WWg</guid></item><item><title>US Measles Outbreak Surges Towards 100 Cases - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE9ORTNTN2kyMG11Q3BDQ21JMTViUjA0ZzYyVFl1Nll2cVRONXdpUlZuVFRJSkpPU2p1eDVqR2ZiTklIT0dxaTF2OGxjbUNpd1FhcEUwVXJfRHk1ZFlyWXlUZXFlYlE1cGY4Y01qLS1tbmNmYnU4Y3VNd3Q2ZWdQQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An outbreak of measles in the US is approaching 100 cases as it spreads into more heavily populated areas, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;predominantly affecting&lt;/a&gt; children and adolescents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;First detected in late January as two schoolchildren were hospitalized for the disease in Gaines County, Texas, the highly infectious virus has since crossed state borders into New Mexico and Georgia, leading to fears of missing cases. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A list of current exposure sites in West Texas can be found &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-exposures-central-south-central-texas"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;23 of the 93 known cases&lt;/a&gt; have bee&lt;span&gt;n hospitalized so far. More than 80 percent of cases are individuals under the age of 19, leading to the shutdown of several private schools.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This is the tip of the iceberg," Rekha Lakshmanan &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/texas-measles-outbreak-escalates-undetected-cases-vaccinations/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;suspects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, telling Amy Maxmen at KFF Health News: "We are going to see more kids infected. We will see more families taking time off from work. More kids in the hospital."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Measles can spread before the emergence of symptoms, which can include fever, cough, runny nose and irritated eyes, white spots in the mouth, and a red flat skin rash about three days after initial symptoms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the worst cases, the highly infectious virus can cause serious health complications including pneumonia, blindness, brain damage, and death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Measles is a highly contagious airborne disease spread by contact with an infected person through coughing and sneezing," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hayscountytx.gov/possible-measles-exposure-in-san-marcos"&gt;&lt;span&gt;warns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Hays County Local Health Authority physician John Turner in a public health alert. "Texas is currently experiencing the largest outbreak of measles in decades."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153204" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153204" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PercentVaccinatedPerStateUSmeaslesMap.jpg" alt="Map showing the percent of the population of each state vaccinated for measles" class="wp-image-153204 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PercentVaccinatedPerStateUSmeaslesMap.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PercentVaccinatedPerStateUSmeaslesMap-560x415.jpg 560w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PercentVaccinatedPerStateUSmeaslesMap-600x445.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153204" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;It takes 95 percent vaccine coverage for community protection. (&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The measles virus, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles_virus"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Morbillivirus hominis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, can survive in the air for hours, allowing each infected person to spread it to an average of 18 other individuals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once in a person's airways, the RNA molecule targets their immune cells, duplicating within them and spreading itself through the lymphatic system. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here, it not only suppresses immunity but destroys the body's defenses against infections by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://asm.org/articles/2019/may/measles-and-immune-amnesia"&gt;&lt;span&gt;wiping out the immune system's memory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This 'memory loss' can continue for up to three years, leaving people vulnerable to secondary infections like pneumonia – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;the main cause of death&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in children with measles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Years after recovery, the infection can still trigger a rare but fatal condition in the central nervous system called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subacute_sclerosing_panencephalitis"&gt;&lt;span&gt;subacute sclerosing panencephalitis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is no specific treatment for the disease, but vaccination programs have successfully suppressed the spread of measles for decades, leading to an &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;official elimination of the disease&lt;/a&gt; in the US at the turn of the century. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prior to the vaccine's development,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; some 48,000 hospitalizations and around 500 deaths occurred each year as a direct result of infections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153205" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153205" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/MeaslesVaccineSymptomsVsInfection.jpg" alt="Measles Cases Continue to Increase Alarmingly in The US" class="wp-image-153205 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/MeaslesVaccineSymptomsVsInfection.jpg 800w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/MeaslesVaccineSymptomsVsInfection-642x803.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/MeaslesVaccineSymptomsVsInfection-332x415.jpg 332w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/MeaslesVaccineSymptomsVsInfection-768x960.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/MeaslesVaccineSymptomsVsInfection-600x750.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153205" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(NYC health)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Health authorities have been warning for years that a decrease in vaccine uptake would lead to greater outbreaks of measles, a reality that is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/measles-cases-soaring-worldwide-as-who-reports-alarming-45-fold-rise-in-europe"&gt;&lt;span&gt;currently unfolding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/global-measles-cases-rise-by-20-as-who-blames-one-key-factor"&gt;&lt;span&gt;around the world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Measles &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/measles-cases-soaring-worldwide-as-who-reports-alarming-45-fold-rise-in-europe"&gt;&lt;span&gt;outbreaks increased&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; by 45 times in Europe between 2022 and 2023.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most of those who have been infected in the current US outbreak are unvaccinated. Gaines County is an area with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/conscientious-exemptions"&gt;&lt;span&gt;one of the lowest vaccine rates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in Texas. Almost &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/texas-measles-outbreak-grows-90-cases-unvaccinated-people/story?id=119041244"&gt;&lt;span&gt;20 percent of parents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of young children have filed for vaccine exemptions in the region.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Health officials in Texas are running mobile testing units in schools and pop-up vaccine clinics to attempt to get ahead of the disease, while also facing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://immunizeusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-TX-Vaccine-Bills_2025-02-05.pdf"&gt;&lt;span&gt;increasing health policy obstacles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to widescale vaccination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I told my husband we have to put off trying for a baby again until we can move, and he said I was overreacting.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="V3O4FG6NARBLJK6MMPKWWXNPWI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;He was out of town when this happened, and I had only my younger sister with me. First, the ER of the small hospital nearest to us seemed to be in an absolute panic when I was first diagnosed. I thought it was because they were worried about my condition, but now I think they were scared to treat me. They transferred me to a much larger hospital via ambulance. Once I got to the second ER, they gave me some pain meds and then sent me to labor and delivery, where the obstetrician stopped the pain meds “in case the pregnancy was actually viable.” They let me sit for hours while I complained and worried about the pain getting worse and worse.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RWNEJPC5BBD25CECXBGNDYHTVA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;After I’d been there six hours, I convinced a nurse that the pain was so bad I couldn’t take it anymore; she arranged for an ultrasound that showed how bad things were, and I was rushed into surgery. When I was in recovery, I asked what took so long and the OB told me they were deciding what to do. What was there to decide?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2RUNDNUVO5CVZOVY6PAMDVG6IY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;We would still like to try for a baby, but I refuse to do it when I live in a state that treats women this way.

&lt;p&gt;You may not know this, but scientific research has established a strong link between muscle mass and longevity. For instance, a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24561114/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24561114/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;2014 study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; indicates that the more muscle we have, the higher our chances are of living longer.

So, should we all be hitting the gym to live longer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, says personal trainer &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://emmasimarro.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://emmasimarro.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Emma Simarro&lt;/a&gt;. Simarro believes that we all should focus on building muscle and getting strong to increase the likelihood of living independently for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more muscle we have, the longer we live,” says Simarro. “Our muscles are an &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.90100.2007#:~:text=Skeletal%20muscle%20has%20recently%20been%20identified%20as%20an%20organ%20that,muscle%20is%20an%20endocrine%20organ" target="_blank" data-url="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.90100.2007#:~:text=Skeletal%20muscle%20has%20recently%20been%20identified%20as%20an%20organ%20that,muscle%20is%20an%20endocrine%20organ" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;endocrine system&lt;/a&gt; in their own right: they affect our immunity, energy levels and sleep because they produce hormones. The more muscle mass you have, the more your survivability increases. Even if you were diagnosed with cancer, if you have more muscle your &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5947445/#:~:text=This%20study%20in%20older%20patients,will%20benefit%20from%20anticancer%20treatment." target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5947445/#:~:text=This%20study%20in%20older%20patients,will%20benefit%20from%20anticancer%20treatment." referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;survivability rate goes up&lt;/a&gt; because of how they function—it's amazing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building muscle takes on even greater importance for women. “It's mandatory I would say; even if you don't like it, women still need to do it,” says Simarro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason is that muscle is important for protecting bones, and women see a decrease in their bone mass from the age of 30, with a huge drop-off after menopause as the hormone estrogen decreases, making women more prone to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/osteoporosis" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/osteoporosis" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why Simarro focuses on training women and encouraging them to lift heavier weights. “From the age of 30, we start slowly losing muscle mass too,” says Simarro. “It's part of the natural aging process and there's nothing we can do about that, but we can mitigate the effects of it. I want to be 70 or 80 and still doing cool stuff. It’s not just about adding 20 years to our lives: we want to live longer but live independently for as long as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-start-strength-training"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to start strength training&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, we know it’s important to be doing regular strength training, but if you’ve never picked up a kettlebell before, where should you start?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-J4vdAem39wmnp9jYDb3KcS" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-J4vdAem39wmnp9jYDb3KcS slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Start training with just your bodyweight,” says Simarro. Before you introduce weights to your training, you should make sure you are executing some of the fundamental movement patterns properly. If you don’t have your form nailed down, your risk of injury increases. “Once you feel confident in those movements, you can slowly start introducing weight," says Simarro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simarro encourages adults who are new to strength training to enlist the help of a personal trainer to ensure they’re getting their form right from the start. “If you couldn't swim, you would never jump into a pool without having a lesson,” says Simarro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if a personal trainer is too expensive, you can use your phone to film yourself and check your form that way. Online classes, like Simarro’s &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://buildingbodyconfidence.com/fitnessondemand" target="_blank" data-url="https://buildingbodyconfidence.com/fitnessondemand" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;on-demand strength workouts&lt;/a&gt;, can also be a good way to start if you’re not sure what exercises you should be doing. “It's a more affordable and accessible way to access strength training,” says Simarro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-long-should-you-train-for"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How long should you train for?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ideally&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;three 45-minute full-body strength sessions a week,” says Simarro. “However, I don't ever want people thinking if they don't hit that target there's no point because there is always a point. If you can only manage one strength training session a week, your bones and muscles will still benefit from that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simarro also points out that those three sessions can be shorter, so don't give up entirely if you can only manage 20 minutes or less. You are still moving and you are still going to be developing or maintaining muscle mass—it’ll just take a little longer to see the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-movements-should-you-focus-on"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What movements should you focus on?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are five movement patterns that Simarro recommends you incorporate into your training sessions once you've moved on to using weights, all of which are functional and should strengthen the muscles you use every day already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start="1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Squat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hinge&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Push&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pull&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rotation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we strength train, we want to incorporate each of those patterns into every workout ideally. So, I would do one squat, one hinge, a press away from me, such as a press-up, then [an overhead press] for shoulders, a pull, and then some sort of anti-rotation to work for the core,” says Simarro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-person-J4vdAem39wmnp9jYDb3KcS-j5hfgG8tCZdNhaERuu1tQs5STRMjolC8" class="slice-container person-wrapper

Here’s what to know.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DALLAS — Measles cases are spreading across Texas, with new warnings issued in San Antonio, New Braunfels and San Marcos. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of Health and Human Services reports 90 cases in the outbreak so far, with 16 patients hospitalized due to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some public health experts believe the number of actual cases is likely greater.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What you're seeing is the tip of the iceberg," said Dr. Diana Cervantes, Associate Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the University of North Texas Health Science Center.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is "probably the most infectious contagious disease on the planet," said Dr. Suzanne Whitworth,  Division Chief of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at Cook Children's in Fort Worth. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We know that about 40% of kids under the age of five who get measles are gonna wind up in the hospital, and nobody wants that," Whitworth said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started in &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measels-outbreak-cases-texas-gaines-county-terry-county-latest-update/269-99d838f0-1c2a-4589-8d18-cc288ea696e7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Gaines County on February 5 &lt;/a&gt;with someone who tested positive for measles and traveled to Texas State University, the &lt;a href="/article/news/local/university-texas-san-antonio-utsa-roadrunners-email-community-gaines-county-visitor-infected-contagious-measles-exposure-main-campus-tour/273-658835f6-2323-434c-88c3-743e2e4b3f68" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;University of Texas San Antonio&lt;/a&gt;, the Riverwalk and a Buc-ees over Valentine’s Day and the following weekend. Since then, Dawson, Ector, Lubbock, Lynn, Terry and Yoakum Counties have also reported measles cases. The virus has also crossed over to New Mexico which is reporting 9 cases.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is measles?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control, measles is a highly contagious virus that can be serious. In its definition, the CDC notes, “Anyone who is not protected against measles is at risk,” adding that two doses of the MMR vaccine provide the best protection against measles.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rash with red, flat spots that begins on the face and spreads down to the rest of the body&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever, can spike to greater than 104&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How does it spread?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles spreads through infectious droplets and the air when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/vaccine-preventable-diseases/vaccine-preventable-disease-conditions/measles-rubeola" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;/a&gt;. It’s important to note that the measles virus can remain infectious in the air up to two hours after an infected person leaves.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles don’t show up until a week, sometimes two weeks, after exposure. The challenge is that those infected are contagious about four days before any outward signs of the virus appear.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Carla Garcia Carreno, Director for Infection Prevention and Control at Children’s Medical Center Plano, shared, “The incubation period is about 8 to 14 days, but it can range from 7 to 21 days."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She adds, “You can have been exposed and infected with the measles and not have symptoms for up to 21 days and usually the person that contracts measles is contagious from 4 days before the onset of the rash until 4 days after the onset of the rash. So for those 8 days. However, the tricky thing here is that before you develop a rash, you can have symptoms that are very non-specific, like influenza-like. with cough, fever, congestion, and conjunctivitis. So you may think you have the flu and, it's measles and you may be spreading to all the vulnerable people without knowing that you have the measles.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What if I suspect I’ve been exposed to measles?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services provides guidance for those who believe they have been exposed to measles.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay home from work, school and other group settings until after the fourth day of the rash onset&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Isolate, especially if you are unvaccinated against measles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Call your doctor before you show up to get tested, so they can prepare&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unvaccinated kids shall be excluded from schools and childcare settings for at least 21 days from exposure to a measles case, according to the Texas Administrative Code&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get more information on how long kids will be out of school and when they can return to Texas &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/idps-home/school-communicable-disease-chart" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;online here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitworth said a vaccinated person "should be fine" if they were on the college campuses or inside the restaurants or Buc-ees while the measles patients was there.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she suggests an unvaccinated or immunocompromised person contact their doctor for guidance..&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If fever, a runny nose, pink eye, or a rash develops within that 21-period but the illness isn't too severe, Whitworth suggests calling a provider before going to a clinic or emergency room in order to keep from exposing a waiting room to the virus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are the risks of measles?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles can cause serious health complications, especially in children younger than 5 years of age. Common complications are ear infections and diarrhea. Serious complications include pneumonia and encephalitis, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s the age group where most hospitalizations and complications have been described. Again, this will be mostly on those less than 5 years of age that have not been vaccinated. So historically, because measles was a disease that we rarely see, most of the adult people are already immune for prior vaccination because of the fact that there was no circulation," Dr. Carreno said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospitalization and complications during pregnancy are also documented risks of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to young children, those most at risk also include pregnant women and those with weakened immune systems, such as from leukemia or HIV infection.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is the recommended vaccine schedule?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, measles was eradicated in 2000 and has been rarely reported since then. The agency stresses that the best protection is the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC recommends all children get two doses of the MMR, or measles-mumps-rubella, vaccine with the first dose at 12 to 15 months of age and the second dose at 4 to 6 years of age. Children can also get the second dose earlier, at least 28 days following the first dose.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For students at post-high school educational institutions without the vaccine, a two-dose MMR vaccine is recommended, separated by at least 28 days.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adults who do not have the vaccine, at least one dose of MMR vaccine is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitworth suggests families with babies who are too young to receive the vaccine take extra precautions.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Make sure the parents; vaccines are up to date, make sure the siblings' vaccines are up to date. If grandparents are keeping those kids, make sure the grandparents' vaccines are up to date," she said. "Avoid any contact with people who have cough, runny nose, red eyes, or a rash. Avoid all ill contacts."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitworth reminds families the vaccine has saved countless lives.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is one of the routine immunizations and remember that this is one of the most contagious diseases. If you were exposed, make sure that you isolate yourself and monitor because you may even be incubating and you can pass it on even if you don't have symptoms or if you have not developed the rash. So I think awareness and keeping ourselves informed with good sources is the key at this time," Dr. Carreno said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
    &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Dementia is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-isnt-the-only-form-of-dementia-an-expert-explains-the-differences"&gt;typically associated&lt;/a&gt; with severe loss of memory and cognitive function. It's often accompanied by a variety of other psychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety, sleep loss, and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="153035" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new population-based study led by researchers from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden has found a common first-line class of medications prescribed to dementia patients for depression could be hastening their cognitive decline, while also putting individuals at greater risk of fractures and an earlier death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though other factors can't be conclusively ruled out, the possibility that some antidepressants might worsen an underlying condition may be important for medical specialists treating dementia patients to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/ssris/art-20044825"&gt;Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors&lt;/a&gt; (SSRIs) and &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/antidepressants/art-20044970"&gt;serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors&lt;/a&gt; (SNRIs) are considered the first choice in antidepressants thanks to having relatively few side effects. Yet &lt;a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3266805/v1"&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt; has identified an association between the inhibitors and an increased risk of dementia in older adults, compared with psychotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unsurprising that &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.13807"&gt;some classes&lt;/a&gt; of antidepressants risk interfering with processes responsible for our ability to think and recall our past. However, SSRIs have been considered &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-antidepressants-may-have-another-surprising-effect-on-your-brain"&gt;to be largely helpful&lt;/a&gt; in protecting brains from neurodegeneration, even linked to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1107411108"&gt;reducing plaques&lt;/a&gt; thought to play a role in damaging brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reconciling these seemingly contradictory findings in the population has itself failed to reveal a definitive answer, potentially because of the type of data collected and limitations in the way results were gathered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their comprehensive analysis, Karolinska Institute neurobiologist Minjia Mo and colleagues used a nationwide Swedish register of medical data collected from newly diagnosed dementia patients between 2007 and 2018. A total of 18,740 patients were included, with just over 20 percent being recently prescribed at least one antidepressant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of those individual drug prescriptions, just under two-thirds were some form of SSRI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found a clear relationship between that medication and severe dementia, with anything more than a standard daily dose predicting an increase of nearly half a point in dementia assessment scores per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153044" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153044" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/graph_mmse_dementia_score.jpg" alt="graph of cognitive decline and ssris" class="wp-image-153044 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/graph_mmse_dementia_score.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/graph_mmse_dementia_score-612x415.jpg 612w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/graph_mmse_dementia_score-600x407.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153044" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mini–mental state examination scores taken over three years, comparing antidepressant use with non-use in dementia patients. (Mo et al., &lt;em&gt;BMC Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the observational nature of the study and its inherent limitations, it's plausible that other factors could be influencing the relationship, making it difficult to draw a clear line between the antidepressant dose and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact patients are already experiencing cognitive decline makes the outcome especially challenging to analyze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However the researchers also found a concerning rise in the risk of fractures that could be associated with higher SSRI doses, which may indicate unwanted neurological interference too, as do their results hinting at an increase in all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study failed to find any such link with SNRIs, suggesting differences in their mechanisms or possibly a limitation in the study itself. Future research could provide clarity on the risks and benefits of each class of antidepressant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note changes to medication must only be undertaken in consultation with a doctor. Physicians and specialists in dementia care take a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antidepressants-could-trigger-some-cases-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome"&gt;variety of risks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antidepressants-are-linked-with-less-risk-of-dying-from-covid-19-study-finds"&gt;potential benefits&lt;/a&gt; into account when prescribing individual patients with a treatment plan and when modifying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tailoring combinations of medication and dosages means considering their overall prognosis, making studies like these essential in striking the right balance in easing the anguish that comes with cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-025-03851-3"&gt;BMC Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dozens of NIH study sections — meetings in which panels of expert scientists consider which research projects the agency should support — have been canceled in recent weeks, after the Trump administration barred the NIH from posting any new notices to the Federal Register as part of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/22/trump-administration-orders-health-communications-pause-cdc-hhs-fda/"&gt;a freeze on communications &lt;/a&gt;across health agencies. By law, notices of study section meetings must appear in the Federal Register at least 15 days in advance of assembly. No notice, no meeting. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Monday, NIH employees within the Office of the Director were told that Federal Register notices for study sections run by the agency’s Center for Scientific Review — which reviews most major academic research grants, fellowships, and small business grants — will start being permitted again, according to an email reviewed by STAT. However, it appears that notices of meetings of advisory councils, which provide additional review and make final funding recommendations, will not. &lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts public health officials issued an advisory to health care providers, cautioning that the state is seeing a “possible increase” in the number of children experiencing neurological complications associated with the flu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/influenza-neurologic-complications-advisory-february-14-2025-0/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;clinical advisory dated Feb. 14&lt;/a&gt;, the Department of Public Health said it is investigating reports of children experiencing neurological complications alongside the flu, noting that similar increases are being seen elsewhere across the country. The most common flu-related neurological complication is seizure, followed by encephalopathy or encephalitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At this time, it is not clear why increased cases of neurological complications associated with influenza are being observed this season,” officials wrote to providers. “One possible explanation is that we are experiencing a relatively high rate of influenza, yielding higher than typical number of cases with complications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that flu strain circulating this year offers a higher risk or that the affected population has a higher risk for the complications than before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have suggested that children with pre-existing neurological disorders or those who are unvaccinated against the flu may be at higher risk for neurological complications from influenza, according to the advisory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although children with chronic neurological conditions are particularly vulnerable to influenza complicated by neurologic symptoms, most children with neurologic complications of influenza do not have chronic conditions,” officials said in the advisory. “Hospital length of stay, rate of ICU admission and death are greater in children with neurologic complications of influenza compared with those without these complications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those that survive the severest neurological complications are “likely to have substantial persistent health impacts,” according to the advisory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the apparent increase of the complications, the department is recommending clinicians consider “urgent” neurology and infectious disease consultation for pediatric patients showing new neurological symptoms with a recent flu infection or flu-like illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Symptoms can include new onset seizures, mental status changes, new onset ataxia, catatonia, mutism and severe lethargy,” the state said. “Include testing for influenza in the medical evaluation of these patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health care providers are being urged to ensure pediatric patients are vaccinated against the flu. They are also being asked to report to the state if any patients under the age of 21 have new onset neurological symptoms and a positive flu test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The severity of the flu in Massachusetts is &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/influenza-reporting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;currently “very high,”&lt;/a&gt; according to DPH. The state has been seeing a level of flu infections that &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/02/11/the-severity-of-the-flu-in-mass-is-very-high-heres-what-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hasn’t been seen since before COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; for the 2024-2025 flu season. While infections for last week were down slightly from the spike at the beginning of February, infection levels and hospitalizations for the illness remain elevated. So far this season, 191 people have died from the flu in Massachusetts, including six children, according to the state.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON — The findings of a new Texas health report say a 250-square mile area of east Harris County is a cancer cluster. Some residents believe it may be linked to decades-old hazardous waste pits in the San Jacinto River.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The residents hope the report will motivate the EPA to force the landowners to clean the site up.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene Hennigan, who has have lived in the Highlands along the San Jacinto River for decades, has experienced great loss. He says it’s due to the waste pits’ impact on the nearby environment.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My son Jeff, who played and swam in these waters...he fished as a kid and has died from two types of lung cancer,” Hennigan said. His wife also got breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worry from parents like Hennigan and other residents in the area prompted a request to the Texas Department of State Health Services to study cancer cases around the area.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/CHI-ESTB/DSHS%2520East%2520Harris%2520County%2520Cancer%2520Assessment%2520-%2520Summary%2520Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;In a summary—the report says leukemia, lung and bronchus, and lymphoma cancers&lt;/a&gt; were statistically significantly greater than expected. Although, the study says it was not intending to look for causes of the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While the findings are not surprising to those living in the shadow of contamination they are a sad vindication for what far too many of us have experienced," Jackie Medcalf with the Texas Health and Environment Alliance said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now the community knows this information does it help with early detection, what is it that can be possibly done to help the communities here?” &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medcalf, whose group requested the study—is hoping to meet with the EPA to hurry the cleanup process at the waste pit sites.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The pressure point right now is to tell the EPA to tell the irresponsible parties to get out here and clean it up,” Harris County Precinct 3 commissioner Tom Ramsey is hoping the state and the EPA will step in. Residents like Hennigan are hoping for progress to be made.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Develop a schedule for completion with milestones, have penalties for not meeting those milestones, and watch them get this done before we lose another hundred lives,” Hennigan said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group who requested the study plans to seek further refined data about cancer cases in this area.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KHOU 11 has reached out to the EPA for comment about the findings and we are waiting for a response.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tgnaNewNode"&gt;What is the San Jacinto River Waste Pits Superfund Site?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The San Jacinto River Waste Pits Superfund site, located in Harris County, Texas (Figure 1), consists of two sets of impoundments, or pits, built in the mid-1960s for disposing solid and liquid pulp and paper mill wastes that are contaminated with dioxins and furans. The northern set of impoundments, about 14 acres in size, are located on the western bank of the San Jacinto River, north of the Interstate 10 (I-10) bridge over the San Jacinto River.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report released Monday does not link the cause of the cancer cluster to the superfund site.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Benefits and a non-existent risk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using an adjusted odds ratio, the researchers found that vaccination reduced the likelihood of developing long COVID with one or more symptoms by 57 percent, and reduced the likelihood of developing long COVID with two or more symptoms by 73 percent. Vaccination prior to infection was also linked to a 75 percent reduction in risk of developing long COVID that impacted day-to-day functioning. The authors note that the estimates of protection are likely underestimates because the calculations do not account for the fact that vaccination prevented some children from getting infected in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that children should stay up to date with current COVID-19 vaccination recommendations as vaccination not only protects against severe COVID-19 illness but also protects against [long Covid]," the authors conclude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a second short report in JAMA Network Open, researchers helped dispel concern that the vaccines could cause sudden cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death in young athletes. This is an unproven claim that was fueled by anti-vaccine advocates amid the pandemic, including the new US Health Secretary and long-time &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-kennedy-election-vaccines-2ccde2df146f57b5e8c26e8494f0a16a"&gt;anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7314a5.htm"&gt;previous analyses&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.063753"&gt;failed to find a link&lt;/a&gt; between COVID-19 vaccines and sudden cardiac deaths, the new study took a broader approach. The study, led by researchers at the University of Washington, looked at whether the number of sudden cardiac arrests (SCA) and sudden cardiac deaths (SCD) among young athletes changed at all during the pandemic (2020–2022) compared with prior years (2017–2019). The researchers drew records from the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research. They also collected medical records and autopsy reports on cases among competitive athletes from the youth, middle school, high school, club, college, or professional levels who experienced sudden cardiac arrest or death at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, there were 387 cases, with no statistically significant difference in the number of cases in the years prior to the pandemic (203) compared with those during the pandemic (184).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This cohort study found no increase in SCA/SCD in young competitive athletes in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that reports asserting otherwise were overestimating the cardiovascular risk of COVID-19 infection, vaccination, and myocarditis," the authors conclude.&lt;/p&gt;

She adds that adults should aim for between 25-30 g of fiber per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, nutritionists recommend 10 delicious, versatile foods that provide the double whammy of fiber &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking for more healthy food ideas?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out the GH Test Kitchen's &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/food-recipes/healthy/g63350024/high-protein-high-fiber-meals/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:favorite high-protein, high-fiber meals;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;favorite high-protein, high-fiber meals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Nuts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Mykola Sosiukin - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crunchy, tasty and delicious mixed into almost anything, &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/g63080822/high-protein-nuts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nuts are one of the best ways to get plant-based protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;nuts are one of the best ways to get plant-based protein&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href="https://peanut-institute.com/about-peanuts/nutritional-breakdown/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:1-oz serving of peanuts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;1-oz serving of peanuts&lt;/a&gt;, for example, has around 7.3 g of protein and 2.4 g of fiber). “My favorite portable snack is trail mix with almonds, freeze- dried strawberries, dried cherries, a whole grain rice cereal and dark chocolate chips,” says Militano. Gaw adds that she loves to sprinkle mixed nuts on top of yogurt, salad or oatmeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Lentils&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you may just think of these tasty pulses as a variety of soup (delicious and filling, by the way!), lentils can also be used as a meat substitute in meatballs or Bolognese sauce, and are a nutritional powerhouse, says Gaw. &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/172421/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Half a cup of cooked lentils;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Half a cup of cooked lentils&lt;/a&gt; have 9 g protein and 8 g fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Beans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you prefer garbanzo beans, black beans or kidney beans, these are the perfect little package of fiber-plus-protein. “I love adding &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/food-recipes/cooking/g60215479/types-of-beans/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:different types of beans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;different types of beans&lt;/a&gt; to soups, salads, stews, pasta sauce, casseroles, dips or rice dishes to boost the protein and fiber content,” says Gaw. &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/175238/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Half a cup of cooked black beans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Half a cup of cooked black beans&lt;/a&gt; contains around 7 g protein and 8 g fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Brown rice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you're craving a base for stir fries, burritos or protein bowls, skip the white stuff and choose &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a41951427/brown-vs-white-rice/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brown rice;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;brown rice&lt;/a&gt; instead, suggests Gaw: It's a whole grain that is higher in both protein and fiber than its refined cousin. &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/169704/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Half a cup of brown rice;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Half a cup of brown rice&lt;/a&gt; has 2.75 g protein and just under 2 g fiber.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Chia seeds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;kajakiki - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decade ago, if you asked the average person about chia, they would probably only know them as &lt;a href="https://www.chia.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the source of hair on a gag gift;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the source of hair on a gag gift&lt;/a&gt;. But now, the &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a63785578/are-chia-seeds-really-healthy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:highly nutritious little seeds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;highly nutritious little seeds&lt;/a&gt; are everywhere — as the base of puddings, mixed into smoothies, sprinkled on salads. And for good reason: Not only are they tasty, but just &lt;a href="https://tools.myfooddata.com/nutrition-facts/100052928/wt1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:1 tablespoon of chia seeds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; 1 tablespoon of chia seeds&lt;/a&gt; has around and &lt;br&gt;1.7 g of protein and 3.4 g fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Quinoa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a nutty, chewy flavor that works equally well in soups, stews, salads and bowls, quinoa is an easy way for vegetarians and vegans to get a good dose of protein. “Quinoa is one of the few complete plant proteins, meaning it contains all of the essential protein building blocks that your body needs,” says Militano. “I love using quinoa as a foundation to a breakfast bowl with cinnamon, berries, peanut butter and a drizzle of maple syrup. &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/168917/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Just half a cup of quinoa;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Just half a cup of quinoa&lt;/a&gt; will give you 4 g of protein and 2.6 g fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Broccoli&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just beans and grains that double up on protein and fiber. With 2.6 g protein and 2.4 g fiber per &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170379/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cup of chopped broccoli;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cup of chopped broccoli&lt;/a&gt;, the ubiquitous green veggie is a great source of the two important nutrients. Militano suggests adding it to an omelette, which gives you an &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/food-recipes/healthy/g61490064/high-fiber-breakfast-recipes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:extra fiber boost with your breakfast;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;extra fiber boost with your breakfast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Edamame&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;thesomegirl - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who doesn't love popping a chewy soybean out of the pod and into your mouth — the protein-packed beans are as addictive as popcorn, and &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/168411/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a half cup of edamame;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a half cup of edamame&lt;/a&gt; has around 9.2 g protein and 4 g fiber. Roasted edamame is a perfect on-the-go snack that comes in a variety of flavors, says Militano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Oats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most comforting breakfast on a cold winter day is also a great choice for protein and fiber. “Oats are so versatile and are a wonderful source of fiber and plant-based protein. One of my favorite breakfasts is a savory oat bowl with eggs, cheese and veggies,” says Militano. &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/172989/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Half a cup of oats contains;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Half a cup of oats contains&lt;/a&gt; 5.5 g protein and 3.8 g fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Sweet potatoes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether baked, roasted or sliced into fries, sweet potatoes are known as one of the best ways to get vitamin A — but they can also help bump up your protein and fiber intake for the day. A &lt;a href="https://www.ces.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/NC-HOTM-Sweet-Potatoes-English.pdf?fwd=no" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:half cup of baked sweet potato;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;half cup of baked sweet potato&lt;/a&gt; has 2 g protein and 3 g fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is everywhere these days—the keto and paleo diet trends are still going strong, and you can fill your shopping cart with all kinds of unusual products, including chips made from chicken and protein-infused beer. And while we know protein is a crucial part of your diet, focusing solely on this macronutrient can put you at risk being low in another important nutrient/ If you are focusing on steak, chicken, and other animal-based proteins, you may be missing out on fiber. “Since animal foods don’t contain fiber, both fiber and protein can only be found in plant foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and legumes,” says Sheri Gaw, RDN, owner of &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/sheridietitian.com/__;!!Ivohdkk!h7Rt5E0BhGEg8hpG6qgAOUN0NSLFKsxPilNWX_ikalbzomkto063PUR_qU2w6dnm-dsEgbu8p9_McXtT93in$" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sheri the Plant Strong Dietitian;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sheri the Plant Strong Dietitian &lt;/a&gt;in the Bay Area.

Getting sufficient fiber also lowers your risk for certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While your fiber and protein needs vary based on your size, physical activity, and age, there are some basic guidelines: &lt;br&gt;“Most active individuals benefit from 20 to 30 grams of protein per meal and 5 to 15 grams per snack,” says Stephanie Militano, RD, a registered sports nutritionist and owner of SM Nutrition in Williamsburg, VA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, nutritionists recommend 10 delicious, versatile foods that give you the double whammy or fiber and protein:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 23:46:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFBuYjd4RkpjWXJLbnR6N1dCSXJzU21aZ0dISVoySFZnM1liRktvR3M2M0U5M29JQjVyU0tTQ1loYi1za2c2bHJVNldQcDB1TTVFOEVfTlNRTkFLWXZkWUdYMDBDQUp5eVJhV1B1c05n</guid></item><item><title>8 Subtle Ways Your Body Warns You Your Mental Health Is Slipping, According To A Well-Being Expert - YourTango</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxPQ0ttbWRMN3RYVjd4MUFqWDRRWkJGaGs0R2c4a0tLREpkR2F2Zk9mbkY2bXIydVE3NjgyWjA4MTNFZU9Ga0YxSUlZRzFGeHlqbC1pLUZuWm9GbDZTaWVnVjZJcnQtV1dLcjlMWWxpcWFRYTgzNWRZclE4Wm5uQjJmZ3RR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's easy to get so caught up in all of our day-to-day responsibilities that we don't realize our mental health is declining until it's reached a concerning point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, well-being expert Dimple Punjab, known online as &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/selfworkco/"&gt;@selfworkco&lt;/a&gt;, shared &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGIqhHeJPJs/"&gt;eight easy-to-miss signs&lt;/a&gt; to watch out for. If these indications sound familiar, it's time to slow down and prioritize your mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here are 8 subtle ways your body warns you that your mental health is slipping:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. You're forgetful.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-02/subtle-ways-body-warns-mental-health-slipping-forgetful.png" alt="Forgetful woman whose mental health is slipping" title="Subtle Ways Your Body Warns You Your Mental Health Is Slipping" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;MAYA LAB | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Punjab said that if "you can't remember what you said [or] did a few moments or days ago," that's a bad sign. Don't worry too much if you misplace your keys once or twice, but if you find yourself constantly forgetting things, it might be cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://livehealthy.muhealth.org/stories/becoming-forgetful-6-underlying-issues-may-be-causing-your-memory-loss" rel="nofollow"&gt;According to the University of Missouri Health Care&lt;/a&gt;, "mental health issues place extra strain on your brain." This can affect your focus, cognition, and memory over time. Stress and depression, specifically, &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/memory/memory-and-mental-health"&gt;increase forgetfulness&lt;/a&gt;, as does lack of sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/health-wellness/want-better-mental-health-time-accept-essential-truths"&gt;If You Want Better Mental Health, It's Time To Accept These 10 Essential Truths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. You stay in bed all day.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/entertainment/sleep-scientist-defends-bed-rotting-self-care"&gt;"bed rotting" has become somewhat of a trend&lt;/a&gt;, spending all day in bed with no motivation to get up is an indicator that you are heading down a not-so-great path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are struggling to get out of bed, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325712" rel="nofollow"&gt;Medical News Today recommends&lt;/a&gt; setting manageable goals such as taking a walk to the park or even just getting up to eat breakfast or use the bathroom. Being accountable to another person, or even a pet, may also help. They further suggest playing music, brightening up your room, and spending time outside. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="player-wrapper-outer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. You're more emotional than usual.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-02/subtle-ways-body-warns-mental-health-slipping-mood-swings.png" alt="Emotional woman whose mental health is slipping" title="Subtle Ways Your Body Warns You Your Mental Health Is Slipping" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Gladskikh Tatiana | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many mental health conditions, including anxiety, depression, and ADHD, can &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/mood-swings" rel="nofollow"&gt;cause mood swings&lt;/a&gt;. If you are over-emotional and struggling to control your thoughts and feelings, that is a sign that your mental health is slipping. Of course, there are many other causes of mood swings as well, such as hormone fluctuations, medications, and sleep deprivation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. You withdrawing from family and friends.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://psychcentral.com/lib/the-importance-of-connection"&gt;Spending time with loved ones&lt;/a&gt; is an important part of our lives — it provides a sense of belonging, reduces stress, boosts our mood, and potentially even leads to a longer lifespan. If you're declining invitations to family gatherings and not replying to text messages from friends, it might be wise to consider why you're isolating yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your family and friends care about you and pulling away will only do you, and your mental health, harm. When you're in a bad spot it may be tempting to stay away from everyone, but connecting with those you love is far more beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/signs-someone-not-taking-care-themself"&gt;10 Small Signs Someone's Not Taking Good Care Of Themselves, Backed By Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. You're losing interest in your hobbies.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobbies reduce stress and help to improve mental health and overall well-being. Some say they are &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/therapist-explains-two-reasons-hobbies-key-happier-life"&gt;the key to a happy life&lt;/a&gt;. If you start losing interest in hobbies you once felt passionate about, your mental health may be declining. Not caring about stuff that you used to is a clear indicator of something being wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. You spend hours scrolling on your phone.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-02/subtle-ways-body-warns-mental-health-slipping-doomscroll.png" alt="Woman whose mental health is slipping scrolling on her phone" title="Subtle Ways Your Body Warns You Your Mental Health Is Slipping" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Olezzo | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost everyone falls into the trap of doomscrolling now and again. &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/signs-self-inflicting-psychological-damage-news-consumption"&gt;In today's political climate&lt;/a&gt;, it's nearly impossible not to. Yet if you're consistently spending hours mindlessly consuming content, this may be an indicator of a larger problem. As tempting as it may be, distracting yourself from your problems doesn't make them go away — it usually makes them worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. You're snapping at loved ones.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're getting mad at your loved ones over minor inconveniences and things that aren't really their fault, chances are you are taking your mental health struggles out on them. Misdirected anger is a sign of poor emotional regulation, which often stems from stress, anxiety, depression, and other mental health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. You feel knots in your stomach.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If "you've lost your appetite or feel 'knots' in your stomach," Punjab said you may be experiencing mental health-related issues. &lt;a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/gastrointestinal-articles/stress-stomach-pain-when-to-see-a-doctor" rel="nofollow"&gt;According to the University of Chicago Medicine,&lt;/a&gt; "stress, worrying and anxiety are common causes of stomach discomfort and other gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms," including so-called "knots."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Research has shown there is a strong connection between our brain and our digestive tract through the central nervous system," they explained. "The part of the central nervous system that serves the GI tract, called the enteric nervous system, makes a direct connection between the brain and GI system. In stressful or anxiety-provoking situations, it can cause normal physiologic processes to be interpreted as painful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/health-wellness/want-better-mental-health-time-accept-essential-truths"&gt;If You Want Better Mental Health, It's Time To Accept These 10 Essential Truths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sahlah Syeda is a writer for YourTango who covers entertainment, news, and human interest topics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="field field--name-field-content-contains-affiliate field--type-boolean field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="rc-widget-c743d1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>YourTango</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 23:21:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxPQ0ttbWRMN3RYVjd4MUFqWDRRWkJGaGs0R2c4a0tLREpkR2F2Zk9mbkY2bXIydVE3NjgyWjA4MTNFZU9Ga0YxSUlZRzFGeHlqbC1pLUZuWm9GbDZTaWVnVjZJcnQtV1dLcjlMWWxpcWFRYTgzNWRZclE4Wm5uQjJmZ3RR</guid></item><item><title>Poor Sleep Alters Immune Cells, Increasing Risk for Inflammatory Diseases - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE13TVNYUm1ZdS1VUEdCaGhkWU15RWp6YVh4TFowamlHTHFkN2NkLWRKbWdiREEyYXVRNmNvWEhHd0dVblZuVnRKRy1UMGRpdXNkOGI4SElCQjRzZGM4TkFSR3AwNUw0LWpDWnpZdGhybTY1cmpE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study reveals that even a single night of sleep deprivation can alter immune cell profiles to resemble those seen in obesity, a condition linked to chronic inflammation. Researchers found that sleep-deprived individuals had increased levels of non-classical monocytes, immune cells associated with inflammatory responses, similar to patterns observed in obese participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that poor sleep quality may rapidly trigger immune system changes, potentially contributing to long-term inflammatory diseases like obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that the immune system is highly sensitive to sleep and may adapt rapidly to changes in sleep pattern. According to the researchers, if these shifts persist, they could contribute to long-term inflammatory states and increase the risk of disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Substantial evidence exists linking sleep disorders and disturbances to an array of chronic conditions and morbidity, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. It’s also known that poor health outcomes can be driven by chronic inflammation but the direct influence of sleep on circulating immune cells, such as monocytes, is not as well understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monocytes are a vital component of the innate immune system – the body’s first line of defense that rapidly detects pathogens and kickstarts the immune response. There are three subsets of monocytes – classical, intermediate and non-classical monocytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-classical monocytes patrol the body, sense and respond to inflammatory cues, and help to maintain and regulate the immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers from the Dasman Diabetes Institute, Kuwait City, Kuwait, analyzed the sleep patterns of 237 healthy adult participants of varying BMI, and took blood samples to profile the levels of different monocytes as well as markers of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that obese individuals had significantly lower sleep quality and higher chronic low-grade inflammation compared to the lean group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-classical monocytes were also increased significantly in obese participants, correlating with reduced sleep quality and elevated pro-inflammatory markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five, healthy lean individuals also took part in a 24-hour sleep deprivation part of the study and had blood samples collected throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that sleep deprivation altered the profile of monocytes like what was seen in obese participants, supporting the role of sleep health in modulating inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Fatema Al-Rashed, who led the study, said: “Our findings underscore a growing public health challenge. Advancements in technology, prolonged screen time, and shifting societal norms are increasingly disruptive to regular sleeping hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This disruption in sleep has profound implications for immune health and overall well-being.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers next want to explore in greater detail the mechanisms linking sleep deprivation to immune changes. They also want to find out if interventions such as structured sleep therapies or technology-use guidelines can reverse these immune alterations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the long term, we aim for this research to drive policies and strategies that recognize the critical role of sleep in public health. We envision workplace reforms and educational campaigns promoting better sleep practices, particularly for populations at risk of sleep disruption due to technological and occupational demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ultimately, this could help mitigate the burden of inflammatory diseases like obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases,” said Dr Al-Rashed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and inflammation research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#79141518143918181057160b1e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Matt Lam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aai.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AAI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Matt Lam – AAI&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jimmun/vkae016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Impact of sleep deprivation on monocyte subclasses and function&lt;/a&gt;” by Fatema Al-Rashed et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Immunology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact of sleep deprivation on monocyte subclasses and function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relationship between sleep deprivation, obesity, and systemic inflammation is a critical area of investigation due to its significant impact on health. While it is established that poor sleep adversely affects obesity and metabolic syndromes, the specific mechanisms, particularly subclinical inflammation independent of obesity, remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study investigates how sleep quality influences monocyte subclass distribution and its association with systemic inflammation across a spectrum of body mass index categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our cohort study, 237 healthy participants were categorized by body mass index. Participants’ dietary intake, physical activity, and sleep patterns were objectively tracked through wearable ActiGraph GT3X accelerometer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data showed that obese individuals had significantly lower sleep quality and higher chronic low-grade inflammation. Nonclassical monocytes increased significantly in obesity, correlating with reduced sleep quality and elevated proinflammatory cytokines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although body mass index emerged as a significant factor in driving inflammation, mediation analyses further defined that sleep disruption independently contributes to inflammation, regardless of obesity status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Controlled sleep deprivation experiments confirmed these findings, demonstrating reversible increases in nonclassical monocytes expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study highlights the importance of sleep quality in regulating immune responses and inflammation in obesity, suggesting that improving sleep quality could reduce inflammation and improve health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 23:18:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE13TVNYUm1ZdS1VUEdCaGhkWU15RWp6YVh4TFowamlHTHFkN2NkLWRKbWdiREEyYXVRNmNvWEhHd0dVblZuVnRKRy1UMGRpdXNkOGI4SElCQjRzZGM4TkFSR3AwNUw0LWpDWnpZdGhybTY1cmpE</guid></item><item><title>AI Model Predicts Brain Aging Speed to Detect Cognitive Decline Early - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTFBfMVd2VURUUUVtSFh5d1pZbld4Wms0SV84bGJlR1EzbGFaS2NhLVRqM2pGaWFJVlBNLVFDY3o3Z2x6WUF3aXlRRS1tSkItMGo1NEFpQ0ZZc0VycWdHNm9aMXpNWEdOX1duSTQwVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new AI model can measure how fast a person’s brain is aging using MRI scans, providing a powerful tool for detecting cognitive decline.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faster brain aging closely correlates with a higher risk of cognitive impairment, said Andrei Irimia, associate professor of gerontology, biomedical engineering, quantitative &amp;amp; computational biology and neuroscience at the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology and visiting associate professor of psychological medicine at King’s College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a novel measurement that could change the way we track brain health both in the research lab and in the clinic,” he said. “Knowing how fast one’s brain is aging can be powerful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Irimia is the senior author of the study that describes the new model and its predictive power; the study was published February 24, 2025 in &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological brain age versus chronological age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biological age is distinct from an individual’s chronological age, Irimia said. Two people who are the same age based on their birthdate can have very different biological ages due to how well their body is functioning and how “old” the body’s tissues appear to be at a cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some common measures of biological age use blood samples to measure epigenetic aging and DNA methylation, which influences the roles of genes in the cell. However, measuring biological age from blood samples is a poor strategy for measuring the brain’s age, Irimia explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The barrier between the brain and the bloodstream prevents blood cells from crossing into the brain, such that a blood sample from one’s arm does not directly reflect methylation and other aging-related processes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, taking a sample directly from a patient’s brain is a much more invasive procedure, making it unfeasible to measure DNA methylation and other aspects of brain aging directly from living human brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research by Irimia and colleagues highlighted the potential of MRI scans to non-invasively measure the biological age of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earlier model used AI analysis to compare a patient’s brain anatomy to data compiled from the MRI scans of thousands of people of various ages and cognitive health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the cross-sectional nature of analyzing one MRI scan to estimate brain age had major limitations, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the previous model could, for instance, tell if a patient’s brain was ten years “older” than their calendar age, it couldn’t provide info on whether that additional aging occurred earlier or later in their life, nor could it indicate whether brain aging was speeding up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A more accurate picture of brain aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A newly developed three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) offers a more precise way to measure how the brain ages over time. Created in collaboration with Paul Bogdan, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering and holder of the Jack Munushian Early Career Chair at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, the model was trained and validated on more than 3,000 MRI scans of cognitively normal adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional cross-sectional approaches, which estimate brain age from one scan at a single time point, this longitudinal method compares baseline and follow-up MRI scans from the same individual. As a result, it more accurately pinpoints neuroanatomic changes tied to accelerated or decelerated aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3D-CNN also generates interpretable “saliency maps,” which indicate the specific brain regions that are most important for determining the pace of aging, Bogdan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When applied to a group of 104 cognitively healthy adults and 140 Alzheimer’s disease patients, the new model’s calculations of brain aging speed closely correlated with changes in cognitive function tests given at both time points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The alignment of these measures with cognitive test results indicates that the framework may serve as an early biomarker of neurocognitive decline,” Bogdan said. “Moreover, it demonstrates its applicability in both cognitively normal individuals and those with cognitive impairment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that the model has the potential to better characterize both healthy aging and disease trajectories, and its predictive power could one day be applied to assessing which treatments would be more effective based on individual characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rates of brain aging are correlated significantly with changes in cognitive function,” Irimia said. “So, if you have a high rate of brain aging, you’re more likely to have a high rate of degradation in cognitive function, including memory, executive speed, executive function, and processing speed. It’s not only an anatomic measure; the changes we see in the anatomy are associated with changes we see in the cognition of these individuals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, Irimia and coauthors also note how the new model was able to distinguish different rates of aging across various regions of the brain. Delving into these differences –including how they vary based on genetics, environment, and lifestyle factors – could provide insight into how different pathologies develop in the brain, Irimia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also demonstrated that the pace of brain aging in certain regions differed between the sexes, which might shed light onto why men and women face different risks for neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Irimia said he is also excited about the potential for the new model to identify people with faster-than-normal brain aging before they show any symptoms of cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While new drugs targeting Alzheimer’s have been introduced, their efficacy has been less than researchers and doctors have hoped for, potentially because patients might not be starting the drug until there is already a great deal of Alzheimer’s pathology present in the brain, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One thing that my lab is very interested in is estimating risk for Alzheimer’s; we’d like to one day be able to say, ‘Right now, it looks like this person has a 30% risk for Alzheimer’s.’ We’re not there yet, but we’re working on it,” Irimia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think this kind of measure will be very helpful to produce variables that are prognostic and can help to forecast Alzheimer’s risk.

BA, however, is a cross-sectional measure that summarizes cumulative neuroanatomic aging since birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, it conveys poorly recent or contemporaneous aging trends, which can be better quantified by the (temporal) pace &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; of brain aging. Many approaches to map &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;, however, rely on quantifying DNA methylation in whole-blood cells, which the blood–brain barrier separates from neural brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We introduce a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) to estimate &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; noninvasively from longitudinal MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our longitudinal model (LM) is trained on MRIs from 2,055 CN adults, validated in 1,304 CN adults, and further applied to an independent cohort of 104 CN adults and 140 patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In its test set, the LM computes &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.16 y (7% mean error).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This significantly outperforms the most accurate cross-sectional model, whose MAE of 1.85 y has 83% error. By synergizing the LM with an interpretable CNN saliency approach, we map anatomic variations in regional brain aging rates that differ according to sex, decade of life, and neurocognitive status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LM estimates of &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; are significantly associated with changes in cognitive functioning across domains. This underscores the LM’s ability to estimate &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; in a way that captures the relationship between neuroanatomic and neurocognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research complements existing strategies for AD risk assessment that estimate individuals’ rates of adverse cognitive change with age.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTFBfMVd2VURUUUVtSFh5d1pZbld4Wms0SV84bGJlR1EzbGFaS2NhLVRqM2pGaWFJVlBNLVFDY3o3Z2x6WUF3aXlRRS1tSkItMGo1NEFpQ0ZZc0VycWdHNm9aMXpNWEdOX1duSTQwVQ</guid></item><item><title>Doctor reveals disgusting risks of eating sushi as Hawaii tourist catches BRAIN WORMS - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors are warning about the potential health risks tied to eating sushi, coming on the heels of a parasitic brain infection diagnosed in a tourist in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/hawaii/index.html" id="mol-db8101c0-f2fc-11ef-9ac4-4583c7517b33"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If not flash-frozen properly, raw fish can be a source of bacteria and parasites that cause food poisoning-like effects – severe nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, the chance of getting sick from eating sushi in US restaurants is low, thanks to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/fda/index.html" id="mol-db79d5d0-f2fc-11ef-9ac4-4583c7517b33"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; regulations that require fish intended to be consumed raw or undercooked to be frozen first to kill parasites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, parasitic infections from consuming raw fish are more common outside the US due to differences in food safety and cultural practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The tourist diagnosed with a parasitic infection caused by the rat lungworm traveled from New England to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/thailand/index.html" id="mol-db82d680-f2fc-11ef-9ac4-4583c7517b33"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/japan/index.html" id="mol-db814fe0-f2fc-11ef-9ac4-4583c7517b33"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, and Hawaii. It’s not clear whether she was sickened after eating raw fish, snails, or produce, all of which can harbor the parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Parasites are not the only concern when it comes to ordering sushi, particularly when outside of the US. Raw or undercooked fish can also harbor listeria, vibrio, or &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-6930609/U-S-health-officials-probe-multi-state-Salmonella-outbreak.html"&gt;salmonella&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Fish naturally carry parasites, but freezing kills them. If sushi-grade fish isn't frozen properly, handled unsafely, or thawed incorrectly, parasites may still be present&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s not clear how many Americans get sick from eating sushi every year. Many don’t seek medical care because the issue generally resolves on its own. But overall, 48 million Americans get food poisoning every year, and of those, 128,000 are hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Brian Labus, an epidemiologist at the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nevada/index.html" id="mol-eade58f0-f2fe-11ef-9ac4-4583c7517b33"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/las-vegas/index.html" id="mol-eadde3c0-f2fe-11ef-9ac4-4583c7517b33"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;, told DailyMail.com: ‘We're really talking about just rare occurrences. But no food preparation is perfectly foolproof. Things can always go wrong.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many fish &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14097627/seattle-restaurant-closed-food-critic-keith-lee-worm-fob-sushi.html"&gt;naturally harbor parasites&lt;/a&gt; that are killed when frozen. However, if sushi-grade fish is not frozen at -4 degrees for 7 days or -31 degrees for 15 hours, if it is prepared in unsanitary conditions, or if it is thawed improperly, parasites can find their way in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rat lungworms are more commonly found in slugs and snails and on the produce they come in contact with than on raw fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anisakis worms are commonly found on fish and can cause anisakiasis. The worms can invade the stomach wall or intestines and cause severe gastrointestinal pain, nausea, and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some people suffer digestive bleeding, bowel obstruction, and inflammation in the inner wall of the abdomen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Japan, where sushi is king, sees about 3,000 cases of anisakiasis annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Labus said: ‘You’re going to find it in places where some of the fish is easier to get. Different kinds of fish have different types; it really depends on which kind of fish you eat and where it comes from. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So, if you're far from the ocean, you probably don't have the same fish options as if you're on an island that has access to fresh seafood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wild salmon from the Pacific Ocean is more likely to carry anisakis or tapeworms compared to farmed salmon, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in landlocked areas such as the Midwest U.S. or Central Europe, fish options are often limited to frozen or shipped seafood. While this might seem less ‘fresh,’ the extra layer of freezing actually reduces the risk of parasites, making it safer for raw consumption in dishes like sushi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sushi fish isn’t just served as-is—it’s deep frozen after being caught, which kills parasites. This process makes sushi safe to eat, and if it weren’t, it wouldn’t be legally sold&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Labus added: ‘The thing to keep in mind with with the raw fish that we use in sushi, is it's not like we do nothing to it. When we catch fish, we super deep freeze it, and that kills parasites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘So even though you're eating uncooked fish, that deep freezing kills the parasites in it, and that's why sushi is safe. If it were an unsafe food item, no place would be allowed to prepare it and sell it.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The woman hospitalized in Hawaii developed a rare type of meningitis - inflammation of the protective layers around the brain and spinal cord - after returning from a three-week trip to Thailand, Japan, and Hawaii. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At first, doctors thought she had a nerve disorder, but her exam ruled it out. Other possible causes, like a reaction to medication, were also dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As her symptoms worsened, tests showed she had a parasitic infection likely caused by eating food contaminated with snail or slug slime. After six days in the hospital, she recovered and was sent home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's not clear how exactly she contracted the worms, but she predominantly dined on street foods and sushi while abroad.  &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Listeriosis caused by listeria can also occur, especially if the fish is processed or stored in unsanitary conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Vibrio bacteria can naturally contaminate seafood, particularly shellfish. While the Vibrio parahaemolyticus bacteria causes gastrointestinal illness, Vibrio vulnificus can cause bloodstream infections, skin infections, swelling, and septic shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While most Vibrio infections are mild, some species (like Vibrio vulnificus) can cause severe, life-threatening infections, especially in people with weakened immune systems, liver disease, or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research suggests that parasitic worms are becoming more common. A 2020 study found that the number of Anisakis worms in raw or undercooked seafood has increased over 280 times in the past 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rise in Anisakis parasites may signal a healthier marine ecosystem, but it also threatens vulnerable species, as marine mammals spread the parasite through their feces. Experts stressed the importance of public health awareness, as freezing or cooking seafood prevents human infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 22:44:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>New Test Detects Early Pancreatic Cancer with 85% Accuracy — and Researchers Say It Costs ‘Less Than a Penny’ - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE16dWpHSko1alJaSlJrRFZWd29MY3dBRlVLYWJVQW0zNHQ4dVJLT2gwWTA0WWhlb1VudHl1VE1RczA1OWhib05uQVA1cV9QTVE5M3NxaG1BaG9wRmxsYWQ4R1A1UHZiQlBKeGNpQndPN2JKalM3VzhtVVhyWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image of blood samples in a lab setting.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have developed an inexpensive blood test that they say can detect &lt;a href="https://people.com/fda-approves-new-treatment-metastatic-pancreatic-cancer-8580431" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pancreatic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pancreatic&lt;/a&gt; cancer — even in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a small blood sample, researchers from Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University say they can detect changes in the enzyme that breaks down protein, protease. “Production of proteases is a hallmark of cancer progression and circulating protease activity may inform diagnosis of certain cancers,” researchers wrote in the journal, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adq3110" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Science Translational Medicine.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test is called PAC-MANN — an abbreviation for  “protease activity-based assay using a magnetic nanosensor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Maps&lt;/p&gt; Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University Knight Cancer Institute’s Cancer Early Detection Advanced Research Center (CEDAR)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://people.com/star-trek-actress-kitty-swink-pancreatic-cancer-survival-exclusive-8630002" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Star Trek Actress Kitty Swink Had a 4% Survival Rate After Pancreatic Cancer — It's Been 20 Years (Exclusive);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek &lt;/em&gt;Actress Kitty Swink Had a 4% Survival Rate After Pancreatic Cancer — It's Been 20 Years (Exclusive)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The problem with &lt;a href="https://people.com/pacreatic-cancer-thought-it-was-anxiety-attack-before-finals-exclusive-11678522" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pancreatic cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt; is that we often catch it too late. Our goal with PAC-MANN is to give clinicians a tool that can detect the disease much earlier, when more treatment options are available and there is a better chance of survival,” Dr. Jared Fischer, a scientist with the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute’s Cancer Early Detection Advanced Research Center (CEDAR) said in a &lt;a href="https://news.ohsu.edu/2025/02/12/new-blood-test-identifies-hard-to-detect-pancreatic-cancer-with-85-accuracy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;release&lt;/a&gt; on the breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pancreatic cancer is one of the most &lt;a href="https://people.com/golden-bachelorette-joan-vassos-pancreatic-cancer-pancan-purple-stride-exclusive-11679304" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:devastating cancers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;devastating cancers&lt;/a&gt; because it usually doesn’t exhibit symptoms until it’s too far advanced for effective treatment.

For all types of pancreatic cancer, including if it has spread, the five-year survival rate is 13%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PAC-MANN test was able to differentiate — 98% of the time — between the blood of someone with pancreatic cancer and the blood of someone who doesn’t have the disease.

(Of course, you should consult with your medical provider before taking any supplements.) Will creatine magically make you a vascular, engorged freakbeast overnight? No. Will it—when coupled with hard training and good recovery—help with your gains? For sure.

The value here is really solid, and if you’re just looking for a big tub of creatine monohydrate—the only kind of creatine you should be buying, by the way—you can’t go wrong with Nutricost. (It also has the standard dose of five grams per scoop, which is key.) I’m partial to the unflavored version, since I don’t really mind the taste, but the brand offers a bunch of different options, ranging from Blue Raspberry to Mandarin Orange. If you’re looking for something to whack into a protein shake or slug down with some water, this is your best bet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="best-pre-workout-with-creatine-gorilla-mind-gorilla-mode-pre-workout" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Best Pre-Workout With Creatine: Gorilla Mind Gorilla Mode Pre-Workout&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to get bogged down in the supplement aisle—I myself am certainly guilty of having a few cabinets in my kitchen that look more like a GNC than I’d care to admit. For those trying to streamline their supplementation regimen, taking a pre-workout that has your daily dose of creatine built into the formula is a great way to get two birds stoned at once. With a grip of decent flavors and both stim and stim-free options, this is a solid choice for gym rats everywhere. (This also happens to be our top pick for &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/best-pre-workout" target="_blank"&gt;the best pre-workout&lt;/a&gt; on the market.) One thing to note, though: Creatine only works if you take it every day, so on rest days, it’s best to use a regular creatine supplement instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="best-creatine-pills-bulksupplements-creatine-monohydrate-capsules" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Best Creatine Pills: BulkSupplements Creatine Monohydrate Capsules&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-hDFFwy jmjUSU product-embed" data-item='{"ctaHref":"https://cna.st/p/5B83M5vYZfeZ6UgzZXVrut9jBLb5WZwmHFNhmgjvEfaNHbeMuUMMzpXBA8iuedJ13rb8nCBVtQHM8PpvLLT3hQyaSo8TLU3xC51px9gABjgEhHkKYwqV17q9kmuJ2WatnZwRsRwyGcLpYi7hyDEkTLtFr62ukvaTrTsp6zUwi8p8xaaniKh31uLFuCzKqnx59WrHupGoUzsFEN7ymWaPagYvAe1oz86JeUJhV142nW4PdxeHchRXP3SgbTU1kZuzJWW7iJ2f3x7SimKYorQp43XxN91v97a9bjekW6PJQ7cj4n1bmQoC6t9ams4KfennpS36K3gr","dangerousDek":"","productBrand":"BulkSupplements","dangerousHed":"Creatine Monohydrate Capsules","embedSize":null,"isFirstProduct":false,"isSponsored":false,"offerRetailer":"Amazon","offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/BULKSUPPLEMENTS-COM-Creatine-Monohydrate-Micronized-Supplements/dp/B0B9HWN8S9/?th=1","contentType":"product","productId":"67bce7365478ec9bfc85f5c6","productOfferVariation":"PriceOutsideCenter","showOfferUrl":false,"showPriceOnButton":true,"showAffiliateDisclaimerOnFirstProduct":false,"dangerousCredit":null,"showLocalisedOffers":true,"isUpcEnabled":true,"showClampedProductDescription":true,"productDescriptionLineLength":3,"hasReadMoreFeature":false,"index":2,"hasAffiliateLinkDisabled":false,"isMobileView":false,"hasMultipleImageSupport":true,"showImageCreditText":true,"showMultipleImageCount":4,"hasProsConsFeature":false,"hasRatingFeature":false,"pros":[],"cons":[],"rating":"","isPrimeExclusive":false,"shouldUseAmazonPrimeDayLiveAPIData":true,"id":"67bce7365478ec9bfc85f5c6","brand":{"name":"BulkSupplements"},"offers":[{"offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/BULKSUPPLEMENTS-COM-Creatine-Monohydrate-Micronized-Supplements/dp/B0B9HWN8S9/?th=1","price":"$19","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/5B83M5vYZfeZ6UgzZXVrut9jBLb5WZwmHFNhmgjvEfaNHbeMuUMMzpXBA8iuedJ13rb8nCBVtQHM8PpvLLT3hQyaSo8TLU3xC51px9gABjgEhHkKYwqV17q9kmuJ2WatnZwRsRwyGcLpYi7hyDEkTLtFr62ukvaTrTsp6zUwi8p8xaaniKh31uLFuCzKqnx59WrHupGoUzsFEN7ymWaPagYvAe1oz86JeUJhV142nW4PdxeHchRXP3SgbTU1kZuzJWW7iJ2f3x7SimKYorQp43XxN91v97a9bjekW6PJQ7cj4n1bmQoC6t9ams4KfennpS36K3gr","reducedPrice":"$18","sellerName":"Amazon","countryCode":"US"}],"component":"unified_product_card","hasMultipleImage":false,"componentType":true,"showProsConsData":false,"showBadge":false}'&gt;&lt;div type="embed" class="UnifiedProductCardWrapper-iFnytN gDPsY"&gt;&lt;p class="UnifiedProductCardObject-fQsetj ixCaho"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-bhBobV hTeQWy"&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardBrandName-kBReJq iUEiRd gpmAoE juENDG upc-brandName"&gt;BulkSupplements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardNameWrapper-fHyUwm iUEiRd hFlUbs yjLhZ"&gt;&lt;h3 id="upc_67bce7365478ec9bfc85f5c6" type="embed" class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardName-jnQGSN iUEiRd klDkXg jTSepA"&gt;Creatine Monohydrate Capsules&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t mess with powders and potions? We feel you. For on-the-go meatheaderry, I like to pack these creatine pills instead of making a mess trying to funnel a bunch of powder into, say, an airport water bottle using a rolled-up magazine. (Though if you're going to go that route, make sure you use &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/v2/offers/gq300" target="_blank"&gt;an issue of &lt;em&gt;GQ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;) A word of warning, though: The serving size for these is &lt;em&gt;seven&lt;/em&gt; pills, which is (obviously) a lot of pills.

This energy source, however, also depletes quickly… so having ample amounts in the system just helps you always keep your ‘gas tank’ full. This can also aid in recovery, as creatine is part of all skeletal muscle tissue, and is constantly being used and replenished during hard training.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jTNfvX"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV etZeIw"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who Should Take Creatine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ kkUQyP idJYjN button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS hAfeaU opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Creatine is used by all ages, abilities, and body types, as physiologically our bodies require it as one of the earliest forms of energy to promote muscle function,” Dewar explains. “That said, I recommend it to anyone who wants to improve strength, power, and lean muscle mass growth. Additionally, there are some newer studies showing that creatine can also improve brain health. All in all, it’s something that has no downsides, in all the literature. I recommend people shoot for at least three grams a day, however five grams is the standard dose. While these aren’t usually standardized for body size, I find that five to eight grams is a solid option for larger individuals who train very hard and are more advanced.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jTNfvX"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV etZeIw"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do I Need to “Load” Creatine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ kkUQyP idJYjN button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS hAfeaU opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, Dewar says. Since creatine can take weeks to produce any noticeable effects, some folks opt to “load” it—a.k.a. take around 20 grams a day for the first week, in an effort to expedite the process. “Just taking [five grams] daily with some carbs is best,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jTNfvX"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV etZeIw"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Is the Best Creatine to Take?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ kkUQyP idJYjN button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS hAfeaU opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatine monohydrate is the gold standard when it comes to supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jTNfvX"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV etZeIw"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How Do I Supplement With Creatine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ kkUQyP idJYjN button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS hAfeaU opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take five grams a day, every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="meet-the-expert" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Meet the Expert&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Dewar is the founder and strength coach at &lt;a data-offer-url="https://j2fit.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://j2fit.com/"}' href="https://j2fit.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;J2FIT&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;I made that declaration on social media a few years ago, right after moving from Los Angeles to New York. I had forgotten about the culture of secrecy and stigma and I wanted to help others not feel alone in the bathroom. OK, that sounds a bit funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I’ve “come out of the bathroom” I’ve been able to support scores of people in our community, that felt safe to reach out, after being diagnosed with IBD or not having luck with various treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say that humor is often a response to trauma. So where does bathroom humor come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A question that can probably be answered by anyone afflicted with Crohn’s or Ulcerative Colitis. Humor can definitely dial down the shame associated with the many awkward situations we find ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that can dial down the shame is meeting with others in the same boat as you – or at least in the next stall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shame only feeds anxiety that attributes to that disruptive flare-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, equipping yourself with the latest information can dial down anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are the ingredients that make up our event this Tuesday evening:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Meet your neighbors that are also struggling in silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Hear about the latest medical treatments from Dr. Hudesman, a global authority on IBD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Hear from Dr. Keefer, a global leader on research and education focusing on the mind-gut connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Hear from our beloved doctor, Dr. Eli Rosen, who understands our community’s health issues more than anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s some seriously valuable information – all sprinkled with a dash of humor, as your evening’s host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is not just for those with IBD. It’s also for friends, parents and family of those with IBD to get a better understanding how to support your loved one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made sure all restrooms are nearby, fully stocked and in working order, so you can avoid another “humorous” story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday, February 25, at 8:30 PM at Lubavitcher Yeshiva, 570 Crown Street.&lt;br&gt;

The decease was suspected in the deaths earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EOCIJFXRJJCQLBJ52D7X7ANTKU"&gt;The virus was suspected in the deaths in Allentown, &lt;a href="https://www.nj.com/monmouth/2025/02/flu-suspected-in-deaths-of-wild-birds-found-on-nj-river-banks.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;as well as several other municipalities in Monmouth County&lt;/a&gt;, where dead geese have appeared over the past weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PYDGID2VDNELDKBP7G4QQADHGY"&gt;The parks will remain closed indefinitely, Roth said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FAUTCQWEDZEGPKXTKS76MNA3UU"&gt;“We’re hoping that when it gets warmer, we’ll be able to (reopen the parks), but at this time, right now, we want to be cautious and keep the parks closed,” Roth said in a brief phone call with NJ Advance Media on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LH67VITA7VFL3OQWAKHLR3LOEM"&gt;The birds were removed Feb. 4 by a contractor. The borough spent about $6,000 on removing the dead waterfowl, the lowest cost from all of the entities borough officials contacted, Mayor Thomas Fritts previously said. About 50 animal control-type businesses were contacted, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XYIFDEVJBFE4XD7U6MOLNNGJZQ"&gt;Since the removal, at least three more dead birds were found and collected, Roth said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UCHLXUHQPZGEDBPR3FNJNNPH2I"&gt;Meanwhile, the borough asked the local Lions Foundation to relocate its popular Easter egg hunt, an annual event scheduled this year for April 12.

                    &lt;p&gt;Many patients with incurable cancer aren’t getting care that could ease their suffering at the end of life, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Close to half of patients with advanced cancer received aggressive cancer treatment within six months of their death, researchers found — treatment that came at the expense of palliative and hospice care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only a quarter of patients received any &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/cancer/a-beginners-guide-to-understanding-cancer-pain-treatments"&gt;palliative&lt;/a&gt; care. When such care did come, it usually was provided in the month they died, results show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Even though clinicians and professional healthcare organizations have recommended early integration of supportive and palliative care for all patients with advanced cancers, it remains underused,” senior researcher &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/research/acs-researchers/robin-yabroff.html"&gt;Robin Yabroff&lt;/a&gt;, scientific vice president of health services research at the American Cancer Society, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“High-quality patient-centered end-of-life care is especially important for maximizing remaining quality of life for this population, yet uptake of advanced care planning and palliative care was low and late hospice enrollment was common,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers compared cancer surveillance data with data from Medicare to build a picture of end-of-life care in the U.S. for cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study included nearly 34,000 Medicare patients 66 or older diagnosed with advanced breast, prostate, pancreatic or lung cancers who died between 2014 and 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, about a quarter of patients received palliative care during that period. The annual percentage steadily rose from 21% in 2014 to 35% in 2019, results show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, 45% of advanced cancer patients received aggressive cancer care, typically driven by visits to intensive care units, researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lung cancer patients were most likely to receive aggressive care (47%), followed by breast and pancreatic cancer patients (41%) and prostate cancer patients (38%), results show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the results also showed more people turning to palliative care and advanced care planning during the final six months of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This research highlights the need for interventions to improve quality of care for patients with advanced cancers, especially those helping to remove barriers to better access palliative care,” Yabroff said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It also suggests the importance of clear, proactive communication between providers and patients and their families regarding advanced care planning to better guide end-of-life care efforts,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cutting-edge targeted therapies and immunotherapies for cancer could be tempting patients and families to opt for aggressive treatment, researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These therapies may inculcate a belief that a metastatic cancer may be curable, leading to potentially aggressive care despite patient preferences for initiating end-of-life care,” researchers wrote in the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed the highest rate of potentially aggressive care among patients with metastatic lung cancer, the disease area experiencing a disproportionate increase in the number of newly available innovative treatments during the study period,” the research team concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new study was published Feb. 21 in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2830176"&gt;JAMA Health Forum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="Body"&gt;Over the past several weeks, Ohio has been one of main outbreak epicenters, with one of the latest events involving a commercial farm in Darke County that has more than 3 million birds, according to APHIS. The virus also struck another layer farm in Ohio&lt;span lang="AR-SA"&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;s Mercer County, a facility that has nearly 85,000 birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;Elsewhere, the virus struck two more commercial farms in Indiana, another hard-hit state. The latest outbreaks occurred at a turkey farm in Washington County and a commercial duck-breeding facility in Elkhart County. The virus was also confirmed in backyard birds in two states, a location in Florida&lt;span lang="AR-SA"&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;s Broward County and a location in New York&lt;span lang="AR-SA"&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;s Delaware County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;Over the last 30 days alone, ongoing H5N1 outbreaks have led to the loss of nearly 19 million birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock"&gt;&lt;span&gt;dairy herd developments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, over the last few days, APHIS confirmed one more detection, which involves another herd from Nevada. The state now has eight affected herds. Since the virus first emerged in dairy cattle about a year ago, detections have been reported in 973 herds across 17 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;CDC updates status of two recent human cases&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;In updates on February 21, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed H5N1 in samples from an Ohio poultry worker whose illness was first reported on February 12. The CDC had initially listed as a probable case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;In its latest FluView &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-07.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the CDC added a few more details about the two recent human cases, including the one from Ohio and a patient from Wyoming. It said the patient from Ohio worked on an outbreak farm and was involved in culling activities. The patient was hospitalized with respiratory and nonrespiratory symptoms and now recovering at home. Meanwhile, a recently reported patient from Wyoming who got sick after exposure to backyard poultry remains hospitalized after experiencing both respiratory and nonrespiratory symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;The CDC has &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html?cove-tab=1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;confirmed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 70 cases, one of them fatal, since early 2024. The agency has also recorded seven probable cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

From mythical fountains to today’s anti-aging creams, the pursuit of staying forever young remains constant. But beneath this superficial search lies a deeper scientific exploration into cellular aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, a team of researchers at &lt;a href="https://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Osaka University&lt;/a&gt; in Japan might have brought us closer to genuinely reversing the aging process at a cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-cellular-aging"&gt;Understanding cellular aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our bodies naturally &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/random-dna-mutations-shape-biological-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;age&lt;/a&gt; as cells gradually become less active, transitioning into a state known as senescence. Senescent cells are not just older; they are distinctly larger and characterized by thicker stress fibers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These stress fibers play a crucial role in how cells move and interact with their surrounding environment. However, why these older cells maintain such an unusually large size has puzzled scientists for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We still don’t understand how these senescent cells can maintain their huge size,” noted study lead author Pirawan Chantachotikul. “One intriguing clue is that stress fibers are much thicker in senescent cells than in young cells, suggesting that proteins within these fibers help support their size.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their quest for answers, researchers pinpointed a specific protein, AP2A1 (Adaptor Protein Complex 2, Alpha 1 Subunit), which seems crucial to this cellular phenomenon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Found predominantly in senescent cells, particularly within the structural stress fibers, AP2A1 could be the key to understanding cellular aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore AP2A1’s function, researchers manipulated its presence in cells, observing significant effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results were very intriguing,” said Shinji Deguchi, senior author of the study. “Suppressing AP2A1 in older cells reversed senescence and promoted cellular rejuvenation, while AP2A1 overexpression in young cells advanced senescence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-complex-collagen-scaffold"&gt;Complex collagen scaffold &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delving further into AP2A1, the researchers identified its close interaction with another vital protein, integrin β1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrin β1 is known for anchoring cells to their external surroundings, specifically to the extracellular matrix – a complex collagen scaffold providing structural support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both AP2A1 and integrin β1 appear to traverse the stress fibers together, a process critical in cell structure and function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrin β1’s role in strengthening adhesion between cells and their external environment could explain the enlarged and raised structure typical of senescent cells. This interaction likely helps older cells maintain their oversized physical characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-potential-marker-for-cellular-aging"&gt;Potential marker for cellular aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given its strong correlation with senescent cells, AP2A1 presents itself as an exciting potential &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/muscles-defy-aging-with-remarkable-resilience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;biomarker&lt;/a&gt; for aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying such markers is crucial in understanding aging at a molecular level and might eventually allow scientists to quantify aging more precisely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, AP2A1 is not just a passive marker. Its active involvement in aging processes positions it as a promising target for medical interventions aimed at combating age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beyond-cosmetic-applications"&gt;Beyond cosmetic applications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is important beyond just improving how we look as we &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/beyond-genetics-the-biggest-factors-that-influence-health-and-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;age&lt;/a&gt;. It targets the root cause of aging at the cellular level. Diseases linked to aging, such as heart disease, osteoporosis, and some cancers, may improve with therapies targeting proteins like AP2A1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If scientists can reverse or slow cellular aging, people might live healthier, longer lives. Instead of treating symptoms after diseases appear, this approach prevents or delays their onset. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, understanding AP2A1 could lead to significant advances in medicine, benefiting overall human health, increasing lifespan, and enhancing quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-looking-forward"&gt;Looking forward&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The identification of a cellular process linked directly to aging offers exciting possibilities for future treatments. Current anti-aging methods usually mask aging symptoms rather than addressing their causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this new cellular discovery targets aging at its &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/aging-hotspot-found-in-the-brain-may-hold-the-key-to-longevity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;roots&lt;/a&gt;, potentially reversing the process entirely. While the research is still evolving and requires further studies, its potential impact is significant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By understanding and controlling cellular mechanisms like the AP2A1 protein, medicine could effectively reverse aging, not just hide it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such advances promise genuine rejuvenation, significantly improving human health and extending lifespan. As science moves forward, these findings could lead to treatments combating various age-related diseases, from osteoporosis to heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though practical applications are not yet available, the groundwork is promising. The ultimate goal is to help people maintain youthfulness at the cellular level, enhancing overall health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0898656825000294?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cellular Signalling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 20:51:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxNTzZUa085VjVSUjViUFpWZE9oUHgzS3dzWHJqLXpfeDc5MDFxdzNhZkt2bENDUWllNlZEb3VXUGw2U2w2ZmlWa3pYUkYwXzV2a1RzRXdyX0VPOFl0UmRPRWFFRnhsbWtlRVdHdHRXM1RJVFViazBEbF80dmwzVWhpd0lDc1BxSUFnWHBya1pQYw</guid></item><item><title>BROWARD HEALTH AMONG THE FIRST IN BROWARD COUNTY TO OFFER GROUNDBREAKING A-FIB TREATMENT - South Florida Hospital News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixAFBVV95cUxQQTlBZkwyd0I5WFJWSTZTVFh4bVhIWEpFOVpNSDJaRm5Yc2NxWUNzMmJMLVZuUUM3anVDOEFybU9PUTNwUHd3NGdVQXBSYlVfX2pRQzNySE5hVGhudGVrb1hxZzRzcC1LTEpRLVgyaUk1aXJCYUtuVlh4ZnQ5S1RKTTdLWVpvVEt1OVhpWlNUemQ0S20xWHRVYXh2UUlUMzQ2dE1Oa29hdDByczVPanFILVpFckh4TEdUZmp1Tzd5ekVpOTdG?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;You are being redirected...&lt;/title&gt;

These vitamins play an important role in many bodily functions, from producing energy to forming cells and supporting healthy immune, brain and nerve function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There are eight B vitamins total, and each one has its own special role. Together, they are referred to as "B complex."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Our body can't make B vitamins on its own, so we have to get them from foods. Although most people can meet their vitamin B needs by eating a balanced diet, B complex supplements are very popular. They're often marketed for energy, metabolism and skin health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Who actually needs to take vitamin B supplements? When taking B vitamins, what is the best time to do so?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;What are B vitamins? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“B vitamins are a family of vitamins which have varied and unique jobs in the body,” Vanessa King, registered dietitian-nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, tells TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“B vitamins do a range of things but are best known for their role in energy production, developing blood cells, strengthening the immune system, and supporting the nervous system," says King. However, each vitamin has a slightly different role, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-heading"&gt;Types of vitamin B&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;These are the eight types of vitamin B and their main functions, according to the National Institute of Health's Office of Dietary Supplements:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Thiamin-Consumer/" target="_blank"&gt;Vitamin B1&lt;/a&gt; (thiamin): Important for converting carbohydrates into energy, cell growth and development, and nerve function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Riboflavin-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;Vitamin B2 &lt;/a&gt;(riboflavin): Plays a role in energy production and red blood cell formation, and acts as an antioxidant to fight free radicals (unstable molecules that can damage other cells in the body).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Niacin-Consumer/" target="_blank"&gt;Vitamin B3&lt;/a&gt; (niacin): Helps enzymes in the body such as NAD function and supports healthy nerves, brain and skin. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/PantothenicAcid%20-HealthProfessional%20/" target="_blank"&gt;Vitamin B5&lt;/a&gt; (pantothenic acid): Aids in metabolism by helping the body break down fats, proteins and carbohydrates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB6-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;Vitamin B6 &lt;/a&gt;(pyridoxine): Plays a key role in over 100 enzyme reactions involved in metabolism, supports immune system cells and aids with healthy brain development.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Biotin-Consumer/" target="_blank"&gt;Vitamin B7&lt;/a&gt; (biotin): Helps the body metabolize nutrients and supports a healthy metabolism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Folate-Consumer/" target="_blank"&gt;Vitamin B9&lt;/a&gt; (folate or folic acid): Crucial for red blood cell formation, DNA synthesis, cell growth and healthy brain development during pregnancy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-Consumer/" target="_blank"&gt;Vitamin B12&lt;/a&gt; (cobalamin): Important for energy production and keeps blood and nerve cells healthy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;B vitamins are naturally present in many foods, added to food products and available as dietary supplements. They are water-soluble, meaning they dissolve in water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Water-soluble vitamins are not stored in the body, and any excess B vitamins are excreted in the urine, Katherine Zeratsky, a registered dietitian at the Mayo Clinic, tells TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I think most people take them in the hopes that they’re going to feel more energetic, which is a bit of a misconception, because vitamins don’t necessarily give us energy,” says Zeratsky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Energy comes from the nutrients in the food we eat, she adds. “What B vitamins do is take that food and help convert to energy, they run all these processes and and help the body build and rejuvenate itself,” says Zeratsky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Who should take vitamin B complex?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Most people are able to get enough vitamin B from their diet and do not need to take a B complex supplement, the experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, some people may benefit from a vitamin B complex. These include people who do not get enough B vitamins from their diet and people who are older, pregnant, or have certain medical conditions or take medications that may lower vitamin B levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-heading"&gt;Vegans&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;B vitamins are found in many foods. "If you have a varied diet (and) you're getting your fruits and vegetables, dairy products, meat, fish and whole grains, you should be meeting your needs for your B vitamins," says Zeratsky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, certain B vitamins such as B12 are found almost exclusively in animal products. People may benefit from a supplement if they have a strict plant-based, vegetarian or vegan diet that does not provide enough B vitamins, says Zeratsky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-heading"&gt;Older adults&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Adults ages 65 and older may be at a higher risk of a vitamin B deficiency, the experts say. "Sometimes older people have a harder time metabolizing food, so they might benefit from a supplement," says King.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"But I wouldn't just offer (vitamin b) to every older adult, it's something you want to discuss with your doctor," says King. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-heading"&gt;Pregnant or breastfeeding&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;People who are pregnant or breastfeeding need extra nutrients, including B vitamins. "We always recommend that during pregnancy and lactation, women are taking a folate supplement as part of their prenatal vitamins," says King.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-heading"&gt;Underlying conditions and medications&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Certain health conditions and medications can also make it harder for the body to absorb B vitamins, especially B12, says King. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22831-vitamin-b12-deficiency" target="_blank"&gt;Per the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, such health conditions include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crohn's disease &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Celiac disease&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alcohol use disorder&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Undergoing gastric bypass surgery&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Such medications include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diabetes drugs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Antacids&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Antibiotics&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors can test the levels of B vitamins in your body, the experts note, and this may be recommended if you fall into any of these categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It’s more likely for a person to have a deficiency in one or two B vitamins than all of them, the experts say. “The most common one I see is B12,” King adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Always consult with your doctor if you have concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Unless you have a deficiency, taking excess vitamin B in the form of supplements may not provide any added benefits, the experts note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Vitamin B dosage per day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The recommended daily intake for B vitamins will vary based on the vitamin and a person's age and gender. “We only need them in very small amounts across the board,” says King.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Healthy adults need the following amount of each B vitamin per day:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Thiamin-Consumer/" target="_blank"&gt;Vitamin B1&lt;/a&gt;: 1.1–1.2 micrograms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Riboflavin-Consumer/" target="_blank"&gt;Vitamin B2&lt;/a&gt;: 1.1–1.3 micrograms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Niacin-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;Vitamin B3&lt;/a&gt;: 14–16 milligrams&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/PantothenicAcid-Consumer/" target="_blank"&gt;Vitamin B5&lt;/a&gt;: 5 milligrams&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB6-Consumer/" target="_blank"&gt;Vitamin B6&lt;/a&gt;: 1.3–1.5 milligrams&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Biotin-Consumer/" target="_blank"&gt;Vitamin B7&lt;/a&gt;: 30 micrograms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Folate-Consumer/" target="_blank"&gt;Vitamin B9&lt;/a&gt;: 400 micrograms &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-Consumer/" target="_blank"&gt;Vitamin B12&lt;/a&gt;: 2.4 micrograms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;People who are pregnant or breastfeeding need higher amounts of certain B vitamins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;When is the best time to take vitamin B?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;B vitamins are water-soluble, so they can be taken during any time of the day with or without food, the experts note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"When it comes to B vitamins, it's not necessarily that you &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to take them at a certain time or in the morning or at night," says King. It's more important to pick a time when you'll remember to take them because having a consistent routine is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Many people prefer to take B vitamins in the morning because of their potential energy-producing and metabolic effects, the experts note. However, it depends on the person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Always talk to your doctor if you have questions or take other medications. “Talk to your doctor to make sure that there’s not going to be an interaction happening,” says Zeratsky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-heading"&gt;Should you take B vitamins with food?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;You can take B vitamins with food or on an empty stomach. “It’s more about how you best tolerate it,” says Zeratsky. If B complex upsets your stomach, try taking it with a meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The experts recommend taking B vitamins with a full glass of water. Always follow instructions on the label and store supplements properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Vitamin B supplement risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It's generally safe to consume vitamin B supplements in the right dosage, the experts note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Since B vitamins are water-soluble, they don't build up in the body, says King. Any excess B vitamins will be urinated out — which often turns urine a bright yellow color. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"However, that doesn’t mean you can’t get too much of them," King adds. High doses of B vitamins may cause side effects, the experts note. These include nausea, diarrhea, headaches or skin flushing, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/23803-vitamin-b-complex-tablets-or-capsules" target="_blank"&gt;per the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"We don't advise anyone to take large doses. ... If somebody’s taking a supplement, look for one that has 100% of the daily recommended intake,” says Zeratsky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, many supplements contain mega-doses and they're often under-regulated because they aren’t approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the experts note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"There is always a question of quality and there's no guarantee that what you’re buying is what you’re getting. There could be fillers, or contaminants, that might not be good for us... so buyer, beware," says Zeratsky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Always buy supplements from reputable manufacturers that have gone through third-party testing, says King. (Look for "USP" or "NSF" on the label).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Food sources of B vitamins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Many foods are naturally rich in B vitamins, and some food products are are fortified or enriched with these nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Food sources of B vitamins include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meat: beef, poultry, fish, shellfish&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eggs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dairy: milk, yogurt, cheese&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole grains: brown rice, oatmeal, barley, quinoa&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vegetables: mushrooms, dark leafy greens, asparagus, potatoes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Citrus fruits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Legumes: beans, lentils, peas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nuts and seeds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fortified cereals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It’s recommended to get all eight B vitamins from food when possible, the experts emphasize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“When you’re eating these B vitamins, they’re coming with other nutrients,” says King. These include protein, fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 20:26:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxQbkJUSjZwR1cxcXpsX3FrSEhxa0JLcFhyVC04bnBBUTFBR080SWNZcV9fU0YzWEViMjNqRWJ3RjdDbU5fME9COFN2R09EV2E5NWZBWFdTV3dwdTh4SkhDdnIwalFSZnRIWnRPSXkwV1JGMmxfNURvQTRIMmtBZEZoanVWMlBKdUXSAVRBVV95cUxPLVZ3cjJyZEVUN2dsa3RKU0Nzc2tXRTd5bkV0SWdjbWs1S2taemlfaHcybnVUX3NzdGs3dV9EaHJIMXB5YVJ3S3owczVtbThzdk85Qm0</guid></item><item><title>Brewing tea reduces toxic heavy metals in drinking water, study finds - Phys.org</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE9mc1J6TGdxdXhmaVBjT2xjMXprcTRqdmtHa3c3S0tsekYzYk1UOGY4LW13QVJlVFZHeXREd1RXMGpLOFdjbkc0b2F4VkZuQ0o1VjRPZTlPYTI5YUJ4U1prc0theF9kYnJUZHNfdEJ5R1ZVOG_SAXJBVV95cUxNUEF1WWpXZnBfdFJpUTAyMjVkdFN2OU45amNLVGhUc0dhUEtyT01mSld2RXlfWE9vRm01UUp0TGFKVjlLT19oelpwZ3FndkZ5cXFtSXdDRGJ6X2dEMTY5YjU0cGE5ZU5GdlE0S2dJNFdrWXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good news for tea lovers: That daily brew might be purifying the water, too.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;In a new study, Northwestern University researchers demonstrated that brewing tea naturally adsorbs heavy metals like lead and cadmium, effectively filtering dangerous contaminants out of drinks. Heavy metal ions stick to, or adsorb to, the surface of the tea leaves, where they stay trapped until the used tea bag is disposed of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the journal &lt;i&gt;ACS Food Science &amp;amp; Technology.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're not suggesting that everyone starts using tea leaves as a water filter," said Northwestern's Vinayak Dravid, the study's senior author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For this study, our goal was to measure tea's ability to adsorb heavy metals. By quantifying this effect, our work highlights the unrecognized potential for tea consumption to passively contribute to reduced heavy metal exposure in populations worldwide."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm not sure that there's anything uniquely remarkable about tea leaves as a material," said Benjamin Shindel, the study's first author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They have a high active surface area, which is a useful property for an adsorbent material and what makes tea leaves good at releasing flavor chemicals rapidly into your water. But what is special is that tea happens to be the most consumed beverage in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You could crush up all kinds of materials to get a similar metal-remediating effect, but that wouldn't necessarily be practical. With tea, people don't need to do anything extra. Just put the leaves in your water and steep them, and they naturally remove metals."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An expert on sorbent materials and sponge entrepreneur, Dravid is Abraham Harris Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering. At the time of the research, Shindel was a Ph.D. student in Dravid's laboratory; now he works with the U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;Exploring different variables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conduct the study, the Northwestern team explored how different types of tea, &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/tea+bags/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;tea bags&lt;/a&gt; and brewing methods affect heavy metal adsorption. The various varieties tested included "true" teas such as black, green, oolong and white, as well as chamomile and rooibos teas. They also examined the differences between loose-leaf and commercially bagged tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers created water solutions with known amounts of lead and other metals (chromium, copper, zinc and cadmium), and then heated the solutions to just below boiling temperature. Next, they added the tea leaves, which steeped for various time intervals—from mere seconds to 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After steeping, the team measured how much of the metal content remained in the water. By comparing metal levels before and after adding the tea leaves, they were able to calculate how much was effectively removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cellulose bags work best—and don't release microplastics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After multiple experiments, Dravid, Shindel and their team identified several trends. Perhaps somewhat unsurprising: The bag matters. After testing different types of bags without tea inside, the researchers found cotton and nylon bags only adsorbed trivial amounts of the contaminants. The cellulose bags, however, worked incredibly well.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to a successful sorbent material is &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/high+surface+area/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;high surface area&lt;/a&gt;. Similar to how a magnet attaches to a refrigerator door, metal ions cling to the surface of a material. So, the more area for the particles to stick to, the better. Shindel posits that cellulose, which is a biodegradable natural material made from wood pulp, has higher surface area—and therefore more binding sites—than sleeker synthetic materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The cotton and nylon bags remove practically no heavy metals from water," Shindel said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Nylon tea bags are already problematic because they release microplastics, but the majority of tea bags used today are made from natural materials, such as cellulose. These may release micro-particles of cellulose, but that's just fiber which our body can handle."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;Longer steeping time, fewer metals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When comparing different varieties of tea, the researchers discovered tea type and grind played minor roles in adsorbing contaminants. Finely ground tea leaves, particularly black tea leaves, adsorbed slightly more metal ions than whole leaves. Again, the researchers attributed this to surface area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When tea leaves are processed into black tea, they wrinkle and their pores open," Shindel explained. "Those wrinkles and pores add more surface area. Grinding up the leaves also increases surface area, providing even more capacity for binding."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of all the experiments, one factor stood out most. Steeping time played the most significant role in tea leaves' ability to adsorb metal ions. The longer the steeping time, the more contaminants were adsorbed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Any tea that steeps for longer or has higher surface area will effectively remediate more heavy metals," Shindel said. "Some people brew their tea for a matter of seconds, and they are not going to get a lot of remediation. But brewing tea for longer periods or even overnight—like iced tea—will recover most of the metal or maybe even close to all of the metal in the water."&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Future opportunities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although results depend on several factors—steeping time and water-to-tea ratio, for example—tea preparation removes an amount of lead from water that should be significant from a public health perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From their experiments, the researchers estimate that tea preparation can remediate about 15% of lead from drinking water, even up to lead concentrations as high as 10 parts per million. That estimate applies only to a "typical" cup of tea, which includes one mug of water and one bag of tea, brewed for three to five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Changing the parameters remediates different levels of lead. Steeping for longer than five minutes, for example, adsorbs more lead compared to the average steeping time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ten parts lead per million is obviously incredibly toxic," Shindel said. "But with lower concentrations of lead, tea leaves should remove a similar fraction of the metal content in the water. The primary limiting factor is how long you brew your tea for."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high-resource areas of the world, it's unlikely that concentrations will reach such high levels. And if there is a water crisis, brewing tea will not solve the problem. But Shindel said the study's results provide useful new information that could be applied to public health research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Across a population, if people drink an extra cup of tea per day, maybe over time we'd see declines in illnesses that are closely correlated with exposure to &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/heavy+metals/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;heavy metals&lt;/a&gt;," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Or it could help explain why populations that drink more tea may have lower incidence rates of heart disease and stroke than populations that have lower &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/tea+consumption/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;tea consumption&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest study administered the vaccine to all nine participants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each patient received a total of seven doses of the vaccine during the study (5 doses during the priming phase and 2 during the booster phase).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Four patients received just the vaccine, and five others received small doses of the immunotherapy drug ipilimumab to evaluate how well the vaccine worked on its own, without the added influence of immunotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adding small doses of ipilimumab helped researchers evaluate whether a low dose of this immunotherapy drug could enhance the vaccine's effectiveness &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seven patients had stage three disease, and two had stage four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All nine patients had an immune response to the vaccine, meaning it activated the body’s defenses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The immune system was able to recognize and respond to up to 65 percent of cancer-causing mutations in patients’ tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vaccine uses small protein fragments that are designed to resemble cancer-specific proteins, known as neoantigens, which help the immune system recognize and target the cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The study's lead investigator, Dr. David Braun from Yale Cancer Center, explained that the trial aimed to guide the immune system to focus on a target specific to the tumor.

Then, those peptides were pooled together to make the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients who received the immune treatment and those who did not saw the same positive results, and no one experienced severe side effects other than flu-like symptoms after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Braun said: ‘This strong and durable activation in T cells was encouraging and indicates that we're able to generate a long-lasting, anti-cancer immune response with the vaccine.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their findings were published in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08507-5#Fig6"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Trials with more patients will be needed to properly gauge its efficacy. Phase two trials are underway, in which a similar PCV will be administered in combination with the targeted therapy, Keytruda, also known as pembrolizumab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the early findings are far from decisive, they are invigorating for the world of oncology research, which has so far struggled to develop a cancer vaccine that can target a broader range of cancers and do so in the way that keeps cancer cells from sidestepping the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Renal cell carcinoma is among the 10 most common cancers worldwide, with more than 400,000 new cases diagnosed annually worldwide and about 80,000 new cases in the US. The highest rates of occurrence appear in the Western world and more often in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Older people, people who smoke, people with obesity, high blood pressure, and genetic conditions, and people with a family history of kidney cancer are more likely to get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kidney cancer diagnoses have been rising steadily, from 6.82 new cases per 100,000 in 1975 to 15.75 in 2022, likely due to better detection, greater awareness, and lifestyle changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Credit: Bridget Ahern for UC Berkeley&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As avian flu continues to kill birds worldwide, &lt;a href="https://calfalcons.berkeley.edu/"&gt;Cal Falcons&lt;/a&gt; is reporting that UC Berkeley’s resident female falcon, Annie, and her latest mate, Archie, haven’t been seen on campus in nearly two months and that the highly contagious disease is the most likely reason why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-aside"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This story was produced by UC Berkeley and &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2025/02/24/uc-berkeley-falcons-annie-and-archie-are-missing-is-avian-flu-the-cause/"&gt;first published on Berkeley News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;February typically is when Annie engages in pair bonding with her mate and readies the gravel nest box on the campus’s 307-foot-tall Campanile. She’s produced a new clutch of eggs for eight years straight, a rarity for a female peregrine, and raised 22 offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But around the start of 2025, she and Archie disappeared from the skies over campus and also from the bell tower’s three 24/7 webcams, one of them focused on the nest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can’t avoid their absence any longer, it’s just too glaring,” said Mary Malec, a Cal Falcons raptor expert. “We have to say what the possibilities are, and what’s most likely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Archie2024-1500.jpg?w=780&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Archie became Annie’s mate in early January 2024, after Annie’s previous mate, Lou, disappeared. Avian flu is now suspected in the disappearances of all three falcons. Credit: Bridget Ahern for UC Berkeley&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cal Falcons, a group of scientists and volunteers, has posted those likelihoods on its &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/Cal_Falcons"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/CalFalconCam"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/calfalcons.bsky.social"&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt; channels, which have followers in 44 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“First of all, we have the elephant in the room: highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI),” the post states. “This virulent and deadly disease is incredibly dangerous to many groups of birds, including shorebirds and raptors. In some species, and for some strains of the disease, mortality is over 90% for infected individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“… It is hitting peregrines very hard right now, probably due, in part, to their habit of taking shorebirds and waterfowl, the latter of which tend to be carriers of HPAI.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post adds that in some parts of the peregrine’s range, nearly 50% of historic territories are unoccupied due to avian flu, and that case positivity rates are pushing 80%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last fall, an &lt;a href="https://www.audubon.org/magazine/why-are-peregrine-falcon-numbers-falling-united-states-again"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audubon Magazine&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; reported a decline in peregrine falcon numbers “not seen since the DDT era” in the 1960s and ‘70s, when the raptors were near extinction due to widespread use of the pesticide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Berkeley, Cal Falcons members have looked in vain for evidence of a sick or dying falcon on the bell tower and at Annie and Archie’s other favorite local roosts. They’ve also been searching eBird reports and Instagram photos. Neither Annie nor Archie wears an ID band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/moon_rabbit_rising/?hl=en"&gt;Bridget Ahern&lt;/a&gt;, a wildlife photographer who for years has chronicled the campus’s falcon family, said she last photographed Annie on Jan. 4, and that her most recent photo of Archie is from late December. She saw the pair mating around that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On campus recently, Ahern left her camera behind to focus on searching for the birds. “I was walking with my binoculars,” she said, “and saying, ‘Come on, Annie!’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-floaters-are-absent-too"&gt;Floaters are absent, too&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Bay Area, Cal Falcons reports that 40% of peregrine territories currently are unoccupied, and that aside from a few very brief sightings of a couple other falcons on campus, “it has been exceptionally quiet this winter.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s bad news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aside from the fact that it looks like we’ve lost Annie and Archie, the most alarming thing is that we don’t have replacement falcons,” said Malec. “We’ve always had floaters around, and floaters are absolutely necessary when birds age out or get sick or injured. Without them, there is no one to breed with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Floaters have no fixed territory and fly within a region in search of a nesting area or mate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Floaters are a sign of a healthy population and ecosystem,” the Cal Falcons post says. “The decrease in the number of floaters is also an indication that HPAI is affecting not just breeding pairs, but birds looking for their own territories, as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 10 Bay Area peregrine falcon sites that Malec recently monitored, there were falcons at only three. Two sites had a pair of falcons, she said, the third had a single bird. The other seven sites were empty, but “it is still early in the season,” she added, “and there is time for pairs to form and nesting to occur.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for whether Annie and Archie might have moved to another territory, Malec said that raptors “show such strong fealty for their territories” that it’s rare for them to leave a home they’ve established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, there were regular sightings of floaters looking to take over the territory of the Berkeley falcons, who often had to aggressively protect it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 2022, for example, when &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2022/02/28/wheres-annie-berkeleys-beloved-peregrine-falcon-is-missing/"&gt;Annie vanished&lt;/a&gt; for more than a week during nesting season, several unattached female falcons circled the tower, eyeing her home and longtime mate, Grinnell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The floaters left after &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2022/03/01/annie-the-falcon-presumed-long-gone-returns-to-berkeleys-campanile/#:~:text=community%2C%20Campus%20news-,Annie%20the%20falcon%2C%20presumed%20long%20gone%2C%20returns%20to%20Berkeley's%20Campanile,'"&gt;Annie’s unexpected return&lt;/a&gt; to the Campanile on March 1, but a female intruder threatened the nest several times after that, and Grinnell defended his home from a female early on March 31. Later that day, he was &lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyside.org/2022/03/31/beloved-falcon-grinnell-found-dead"&gt;found dead&lt;/a&gt; in downtown Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, Malec added, “Grinnell was replaced by &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2022/04/18/its-alden-record-number-of-voters-chose-new-berkeley-falcons-name/"&gt;Alden&lt;/a&gt; in just seven hours — seven.” She was referring to the falcon who speedily took Grinnell’s spot at the bell tower and helped Annie incubate the eggs in the nest. He disappeared in late 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="were-all-clinging-to-hope"&gt;‘We’re all clinging to hope’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peterson said there is a slim possibility that Annie and Archie are on an extended hunting trip, as there are “huge swaths of unoccupied hunting grounds out there due to HPAI.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or it could be that predators, like great horned owls or eagles, harmed the pair, he added, or that some other dynamic is occurring “that we don’t understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If avian flu is the culprit, it’s not the first time the disease may have struck Berkeley’s falcon family. In winter 2024, Annie’s then-mate, &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/01/30/nesting-season-is-here-with-a-new-mate-for-uc-berkeley-s-peregrine-falcon-annie/"&gt;Lou, disappeared&lt;/a&gt;, and Cal Falcons suspected HPAI. &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/02/19/it-s-archie-contest-ends-to-name-uc-berkeley-s-new-male-peregrine-falcon/"&gt;Archie&lt;/a&gt; took Lou’s place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it’s strongly assumed that one of Annie and Grinnell’s offspring, Sequoia, died of HPAI, since &lt;a href="https://baynature.org/2023/04/13/avian-flu-claims-at-least-6-california-condors-and-a-beloved-bay-area-peregrine-falcon/"&gt;it was confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that his mate, Shasta, contracted it in late March 2023. The two lived on San Jose City Hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Annie and Archie don’t return, said Malec, there’s always hope that the nest box atop the tower will be inhabited by falcons again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a really good place for peregrines,” she said, “They will know it’s been a successful nest site by the whitewash (excrement) on the tower.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Peterson said it could take some time for younger falcons to fill open territories after the HPAI outbreak wanes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless new raptors claim the tower, Cal Falcons is not giving up hope that the pair will return there, where they could successfully nest as late as May and raise chicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Studying biology, you learn over and over again that totally unexpected things can happen,” said Peterson. “There’s so much random change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annie, the fierce matriarch and a campus mainstay since late 2016, “could still show up, she still could,” he continued. “I don’t think it’s likely, but &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2022/02/28/wheres-annie-berkeleys-beloved-peregrine-falcon-is-missing/"&gt;we’ve written her obit before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re all clinging to hope, even if it’s a meager amount.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, photographer Ahern has decided how to answer people who approach her on campus, wondering where the falcons are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If people ask me,” she said, “I say I haven’t seen them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group is-style-border"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-newspack-blocks-homepage-articles  wpnbha is-grid columns-3 colgap-3 show-image image-aligntop ts-1 is-3 is-landscape  has-text-align-left"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to age like a fine wine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/19/health/5-easy-exercises-to-do-at-home-to-test-how-well-youre-aging/"&gt;Everyone loses muscle mass&lt;/a&gt; as they get older. &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/20/health/sign-in-your-jaw-could-mean-60-higher-chance-of-dementia/"&gt;Sarcopenia is a significant loss&lt;/a&gt; of muscle mass and strength, which increases the risk of falls, hospitalization, less independence and premature death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Rutgers and other universities &lt;a href="https://wne.edu/news/2025/02/new-research-shows-grapes-improve-muscle-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;may have found a simple and tasty approach&lt;/a&gt; to maintaining muscle along with exercise and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/28/health/dietitian-reveals-best-time-to-eat-protein-to-reach-health-goals/"&gt;high-protein diets&lt;/a&gt; — grapes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This study provides compelling evidence that grapes have the potential to enhance muscle health at the genetic level,” said John Pezzuto, senior investigator of the new study and dean of pharmacy and health sciences at Western New England University.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Given their safety profile and widespread availability, it will be exciting to explore how quickly these changes can be observed in human trials,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.freshproduce.com/siteassets/files/reports/retail/23-commodityreport-grapes.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The US consumes billions&lt;/a&gt; of pounds of grapes annually. &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/08/16/eating-grapes-can-extend-your-life-and-reduce-dementia-risk-study/"&gt;The sweet fruit&lt;/a&gt; is a good source of fiber, vitamins, minerals and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/17/health/6-antioxidant-rich-superfoods-can-help-you-live-longer-dietitian/"&gt;phytochemicals&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/30/health/doctor-says-frozen-grapes-will-stop-you-from-stress-eating/"&gt;potential health benefits&lt;/a&gt; for the heart, kidneys, eyes, skin and gastrointestinal system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors of the new study found that consuming the equivalent of two servings of grapes a day altered over 20,000 genes in elderly mice, significantly influencing how their muscles generate energy to function.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research led by the Wuhan Institute of Virology has identified a distinct bat virus lineage capable of infecting human cells using the ACE2 receptor. The newly discovered merbecovirus, designated HKU5-CoV-2, was isolated from Pipistrellus bats collected in Guangdong Province, China.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In lab testing, the virus demonstrates broad host affinities across various mammalian species, though no evidence of human transmission has ever been reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pipistrelle bats are found worldwide, from the American West to southern Europe and Asia, and are the most common bat throughout the UK. Small enough to fit inside a child's shoe, these small nocturnal mammals primarily feed on flying insects like mosquitoes and moths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merbecoviruses, a subgenus of betacoronaviruses, include MERS-CoV and several bat-derived coronaviruses. Historically, these viruses primarily use the DPP4 receptor for cell entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis revealed HKU5-CoV-2's utilization of human ACE2, a receptor typically engaged by SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and HCoV-NL63. Previous research on HKU5-CoV lineage 1 showed limited ability to use human ACE2. HKU5-CoV-2's use of this receptor raises concerns over potential animal and human transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Bat-infecting merbecovirus HKU5-CoV lineage 2 can use human ACE2 as a cell entry receptor," &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867425001448" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Cell&lt;/i&gt;, the team details the virus's identification, structural analysis, and infection mechanisms. Researchers screened Pipistrelle anal swab samples using pan-coronavirus PCR and sequenced six HKU5-CoV strains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phylogenetic analysis classified these viruses into a distinct lineage (lineage 2). Representative strain BtHKU5-CoV-2-441 shared 78.8%–78.9% genomic similarity with the HKU5 prototype strain. Structural differences in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) distinguished HKU5-CoV-2 from lineage 1 viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Cryo-electron microscopy revealed that HKU5-CoV-2 binds human ACE2 through a unique interaction pattern. Mutagenesis analysis showed that single-point mutations in the RBD minimally affected binding, indicating that the virus's RBD can tolerate mutations without significantly affecting ACE2 binding. Functional assays confirmed HKU5-CoV-2's ability to infect human ACE2-expressing cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authentic virus isolate BtHKU5-CoV-2-023 infected human respiratory and enteric organoids, with viral titers increasing by up to 2 log units. Infection was absent in ACE2 knockout cells and restored upon ACE2 reintroduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protease dependency assays indicated that both TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L facilitate viral entry. The spike protein's S1/S2 and S2 cleavage sites were crucial for membrane fusion, though their cleavage efficiency was lower than that of MERS-CoV. Trypsin treatment enhanced viral entry and S protein cleavage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential therapeutic interventions were evaluated. Monoclonal antibodies targeting the S2 subunit and the fusion inhibitor EK1C4 inhibited viral entry. Small molecules nirmatrelvir, remdesivir, and GC376 suppressed viral replication in cell culture. Unlike broad S2-targeting antibodies, SARS-CoV-2-targeting antibodies did not effectively neutralize HKU5-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with HKU5-CoV-2's ACE2 affinity and broad potential host range, its lower binding affinity and suboptimal S protein cleavage reduce the immediate risk of human spillover. While not an immediate threat, the virus's mutational potential for cross-species transmission and adaptation ability warrants continued surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No in vivo animal studies were conducted to test pathogenicity and transmissibility in a live host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Vitamin K2 is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays many different roles in the body. Vitamin K2 is found in animal foods and fermented food and can also be made by bacteria in the gut,” says &lt;a href="https://amydavisrd.com/recipes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amy Davis, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist. She adds that vitamin K2 is involved in various reactions in the body, supporting everything from bone and cardiovascular health to blood clotting.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Vitamin K2 helps regulate calcium in the body, directing it to bones and teeth while preventing buildup in arteries and soft tissues. This is essential for bone strength and cardiovascular health,” adds &lt;a href="https://www.thesportsnutritionplaybook.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amy Goodson, M.S., RD, CSSD, LD&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A vitamin K deficiency is very rare among most healthy adults. However, it can occur in individuals with malabsorption disorders or those taking medications that interfere with vitamin K absorption, such as antibiotics. People with gastrointestinal conditions like celiac disease or ulcerative colitis may have difficulty absorbing vitamin K. Individuals who have undergone bariatric surgery may also be at risk for being low in vitamin K.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since there isn’t enough data to establish a precise daily requirement for vitamin K, an Adequate Intake level has been set to ensure nutritional adequacy. For adults 19 and older, the AI is 120 micrograms per day for males and 90 mcg per day for females, including during pregnancy.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Supports Bone Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although you can’t see them, you can’t forget about &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-bone-health-8737183" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;your bones and their health&lt;/a&gt;. Vitamin K2 is important for strengthening them by activating a protein that helps bind calcium to the bone.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Studies suggest that adequate K2 intake can help improve bone mineral density, particularly in older adults and postmenopausal women, who are at higher risk of osteoporosis,” explains Goodson. She adds that the body utilizes calcium to strengthen bones, reducing the risk of fractures and lowering the likelihood of breaks.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Promotes Heart Health  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin K2 also plays a role in keeping your heart healthy. “Vitamin K2 helps prevent calcium buildup in the arteries, reducing arterial stiffness and lowering the risk of heart disease,” says Davis. When arteries become less flexible, it makes it harder for blood to flow easily, thus increasing the risk of heart-related issues, such as high blood pressure, heart disease and even heart failure. “Studies suggest that adequate K2 intake is linked to better cardiovascular outcomes over time,” says Davis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Enhance Brain Function  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As we age, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8044818/what-happens-to-your-brain-as-you-age/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;our brain function naturally declines&lt;/a&gt;, making tasks like recalling information or solving problems more challenging. “Emerging research suggests a potential role in cognitive health and reducing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases,” says Goodson. She says vitamin K2 does this by reducing oxidative stress and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and producing sphingolipids, a type of fat essential for brain function and communication. Therefore, a higher intake of vitamin K2 may keep your brain firing quickly from all cylinders and potentially lower the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, such as dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Supports Dental Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin K2 supports your smile. “Vitamin K2 contributes to oral health by supporting dentin production and activating osteocalcin, which helps maintain strong teeth,” says Davis. Dentin is the tissue inside your teeth. And osteocalcin activates a protein that helps strengthen teeth.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;She adds that some research suggests that vitamin K2 may also work hand-in-hand with other fat-soluble vitamins, like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8034163/benefits-vitamin-d/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D3&lt;/a&gt;, to improve tooth remineralization. This means it can help reduce tooth loss and decay.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you are a fan of Popeye, you’re likely loading up on leafy greens like spinach and collards, which are an &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-rich-in-vitamin-k-8635254" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;excellent source of vitamin K&lt;/a&gt;. But if you are looking for vitamin K2, you’ll want to focus on different foods.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Here are some of the best food sources of vitamin K2:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animal proteins like ground beef, chicken breast, chicken liver, ham&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dairy foods including Cheddar cheese, mozzarella and dairy milk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/281916/must-eat-fermented-foods-for-a-healthy-gut/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Fermented foods&lt;/a&gt; like natto (fermented soybeans) and sauerkraut&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eggs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Keep in mind that vitamin K2 is a fat-soluble vitamin, meaning it’s best absorbed when paired with fat. So, don’t skip out on including a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7993588/ways-to-add-healthy-fat-to-your-meals/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy source of fat&lt;/a&gt; at these mealtimes for better absorption.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There is no established upper limit for vitamin K due to its low potential for toxicity. Vitamin K2 is generally safe, but high doses may interfere with blood-thinning medications like warfarin. Goodson says mild side effects may include stomach discomfort but are also rare.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Individuals who are vegetarians or vegans may benefit from taking a vitamin K2 supplement, as vitamin K2 is mostly found in animal products like chicken, beef, eggs and dairy products. Goodson explains that vitamin K1, commonly found in plant-based foods (like spinach), is poorly absorbed compared to vitamin K2, which is more bioavailable. People looking to support their bone health and keep their hearts strong may also benefit from vitamin K2 supplementation. It’s important to always consult your primary health care provider before starting any supplement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;However, certain groups should avoid supplementation:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Anyone on blood thinners, such as warfarin (Coumadin) and similar anticoagulants, can have serious and potentially dangerous interactions. People on these medications are advised to keep a steady intake of vitamin K from food and/or supplements and avoid drastic changes in intake. Consider working with a dietitian for guidance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone taking antibiotics, as antibiotics can disrupt bacteria in the gut and decrease vitamin K status.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People taking weight-loss medications like Orlistat may experience reduced vitamin K absorption, as this medication reduces the body’s ability to absorb dietary fat.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-look-for-in-a-vitamin-k2-supplement"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What to Look For in a Vitamin K2 Supplement &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Vitamin K is often found in multivitamins or multimineral supplements. However, if you are looking for a single vitamin, Davis recommends choosing one in the MK-7 form of vitamin K2 for better absorption and longer-lasting effects. She also recommends a soft-gel, oil-based formula, as pairing the supplement with fat ensures maximal absorption. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Secondly, look for a supplement that has undergone independent verification to ensure its high quality and safety. Look for seals from trusted organizations like ConsumerLab, NSF international or USP on the label. Next, look for one that is free from unnecessary ingredients and doesn’t list proprietary blends, formulas or complexes under ingredients. These steps ensure you do not ingest heavy metals or other contaminants.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Vitamin K2 plays a role in maintaining bone and heart health and supporting blood clotting. It also plays a role in cognitive functioning and dental health. Vitamin K2 is found in animal products and fermented foods. For enhanced absorption, pair a vitamin K2 supplement with a source of fat or look for a supplement that is in an oil-based formula and soft-gel form. Remember, eating a well-balanced diet is one way to ensure you consume enough vitamins and minerals, including vitamin K2. Before beginning any new supplementation, check with your doctor to ensure it’s safe for you.&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Aidan Giles, his 33-year-old grandson, said: “We were shocked and devastated when we found out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was in his urethra and it was stuck in there and went to the edge of his bladder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My grandfather was bed-bound and his world was slowly going because of this stuck catheter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The family has grave concerns about patient care at Northampton General Hospital (NGH). There are numerous issues, but the most glaring is that doctors failed to remove the catheter fragment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were told they didn’t believe the scan. Instead, my grandfather was repeatedly given antibiotics to fight off a UTI when, in reality, the retained catheter was causing scarring, persistent infections, and at least one episode of sepsis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Giles, who had a grandson and two great-grandchildren, was admitted to NGH in November 2021 after having problems urinating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His family said he became virtually immune to the effects of antibiotics and pushed for a full-body scan after being left puzzled by the repeated infections and weakened state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But hospital staff allegedly refused the scan and instead opted to place him on end of life care, his family claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a two-year battle, a CT scan was finally carried out and the broken piece of catheter was found and removed in April last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;‘It brought him closer to death’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aidan added: “He was such a trooper but he must have been in a lot of pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe this could have been mitigated if they had taken this catheter out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He was struggling, he was struggling with pain and breathing. It wasn’t nice for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have no doubts that having it inside him brought him closer to death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cause of death listed on Mr Giles’ death certificate is old age and frailty, along with dementia, cardiac failure and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An inquest into his death will take place in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie Hogg, chief nurse at University Hospitals of Northamptonshire NHS Trust, said: “I met with Mr Giles recently to offer my apologies for the care that his grandfather received and our poor communication with his family subsequently, we should have done better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We provide care for hundreds of thousands of patients each year and, while many experience good care, we know that unfortunately we don’t always get it right for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are absolutely committed to listening to our patients and making things better.”&lt;/p&gt;

He joined the U.S. Marine Corps when he was 17 and served in World War II and the Korean War. The veteran is a survivor of the &lt;a href="https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/topics/battle-iwo-jima" target="_blank"&gt;Battle of Iwo Jima&lt;/a&gt;, fought 80 years ago, and watched the &lt;a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/article/joe-rosenthal-and-flag-raising-iwo-jima" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. flag-raisin&lt;/a&gt;g on the island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Caminiti later worked for decades making bearings for a division of General Motors in Connecticut.

He had a paper route as a kid and used to go to a Boys Club when he was 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Today, he goes to the gym every morning from Monday to Friday. He walks on a treadmill for 30-40 minutes, then uses weight machines to strengthen the muscles in his legs, arms and other areas of his body. He finishes by lying on a hydro massage bed to relax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Some people get a trainer to show them what they want to do, but at my age, I don’t need a trainer. I’ve been going to the gym since I was a kid,” Caminiti says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Nothing needs to motivate me.

Whenever they put (it) in front of me, I ate it,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“He ate healthy, but he also ate pretty much whatever he wanted,” his son adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The centenarian has recently lost weight because of an esophagus problem, which makes it hard for food to go down — a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7102894/" target="_blank"&gt;common issue as people age&lt;/a&gt; — so he now has to take his time to eat and choose foods carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But he still loves dessert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Oh, yes. I have ice cream almost every night.

She still cooks their meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“It’s a regular apartment house,” Caminiti emphasizes. “Assisted living — I don’t need that yet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 17:56:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNTk1seVJWYmcyWi1xaTc1UFktZGN0V0FRanJ5eV9DNWtHYUV6cG5rc3pHbTVMUlE5eS01NWNZTzctMnZYZi01eEhnYTdNU016dlBfamhCOVAtYzAxS2tndE9ULWhDWG04OTltNHN6WDRTSFBXQU4xRnJMSGktdkFXQ0s3SU13c1FwcmNV0gFUQVVfeXFMUFB5TnJJMlBDREoyWlpmSVhfZzlzWW9IQkwxZ1dIZ2k5RjNmYWs5elZJWG1ydkxITElyekhtLTJnV0t5VHFzZExZY1l3ZmV0clNMWUxK</guid></item><item><title>Pancreatic cancer RNA vaccine shows durable T cell immunity - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNa0JEZTNqTm9GLTE4RHAxRFpYUU5XM0xzYV9aUTB4dW1zekRVZWNLMW1zT0dBZXhLX3gzbFp6dnJ3cmNXNkg1Um5vU0h1a2puUDNsbXgxNGNGNi1sbi1pVk96UEk5UUQ4Q3FHZHhqOXpxdjBWbFJTeG5yUFhpSU9pSjNQZHpUbndZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-byline text-low"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center researchers have found RNA neoantigen vaccines that generate long-lived, functional CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), potentially delaying disease recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;PDAC is a lethal cancer with limited treatment options and a low mutational burden. T cells defend the body by destroying harmful outside pathogens and mutated body cells, such as cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutations in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/tumor+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;tumor cells&lt;/a&gt; can create neoantigens, novel proteins not present in normal cells. Finding these (via MHC molecules) alerts T cells that the tumor cell is no longer part of the body's normal self. The low mutational burden of PDAC produces few neoantigens, making tumors difficult for T cells to distinguish from self cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional cancer vaccines have struggled to produce durable tumor-specific T cell responses. This study aimed to determine if an RNA neoantigen vaccine could induce long-term functional T cells that correlate with delayed PDAC recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Phase I trial, "RNA neoantigen vaccines prime long-lived CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/pancreatic+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt;," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08508-4" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;, the team evaluated the effects of autogene cevumeran, an individualized mRNA–lipoplex vaccine encoding up to 20 neoantigens, combined with surgery, atezolizumab, and chemotherapy (mFOLFIRINOX).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixteen patients with resectable PDAC received autogene cevumeran following surgery and a single dose of atezolizumab, succeeded by 12 cycles of modified FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy and a vaccine boost. Investigators assessed vaccine-induced T cell responses using ex vivo IFNγ ELISpot assays, T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, and longitudinal blood and tissue analyses over a median follow-up of 3.2 years.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Eight of the sixteen vaccinated patients developed strong neoantigen-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell responses following vaccination. These patients, referred to as responders, experienced fewer cancer recurrences during the study period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A median time to recurrence for the responders could not be determined since the majority had not relapsed by the study's end. Highly favorable survival outcomes of the responders were compared to a median of 13.4 months in non-responders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CloneTrack, a sequencing-based tool, identified 79 vaccine-induced CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell clones in responders. Clones induced during priming doses reached peak expansion after six or fewer doses, with an average 100-fold expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccine-induced CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell clones demonstrated long-term persistence, with a projected average lifespan of 7.7 years post-boost. 86% of clones persisted at substantial frequencies for ~3 years post-vaccination. Approximately 20% of these clones could persist for decades, potentially outliving the host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccine-induced T cells transitioned from proliferative to effector states and stabilized as tissue-resident memory-like (TRM-like) cells, retaining cytotoxic functions for years. Persistent CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells maintained neoantigen-specific effector function upon in vitro rechallenge, even up to 3.6 years post-vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumors from &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/patients/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;patients&lt;/a&gt; who recurred showed a selective loss of vaccine-targeted cancer clones, indicating the need to address tumor heterogeneity and clonal escape mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential of adjuvant mRNA–lipoplex neoantigen vaccines to induce durable, functional immunity (after surgery) in one of the most treatment-resistant cancers is clearly established (for a Phase I trial) with potential applications to cancers beyond PDAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larger trials are needed to confirm efficacy and further research on increasing responder rates and reducing clonal escape.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Many Viking-era Scandinavians likely showed off their badass scars from raiding and pillaging, but they were probably kvetching more about an ear infection or gum disease. That’s according to new research, in which high-tech imaging revealed that many Vikings may have suffered from persistent, painful maladies in their heads.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2005, archaeologists excavated the remains of over 300 Vikings in the town of Varnhem. The remains dated back to between the 10th and 12th centuries, making the site one of Sweden’s earliest Christian settlements (while &lt;em&gt;The Northman&lt;/em&gt; may have you believe Vikings were pagans, almost all had &lt;a href="https://sonsofvikings.com/blogs/history/the-vikings-and-christianity?srsltid=AfmBOor7XXydylK2V9VSYlRhOR-yXhAbFJWfbLXgNBHz5tVGruAqGWb_"&gt;converted to Christianity&lt;/a&gt; by the mid-eleventh century).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To try to learn more about the conditions in which these people lived, archaeologists selected 15 skulls from individuals who died between the ages of 20 and 60. They then performed CT scans, using multiple X-rays to capture detailed images of the inner structures. A team of two radiologists and a dentist then examined the images.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There was much to look at. We found many signs of disease in these individuals,” said Carolina Bertilsson, a dentist and assistant researcher at the University of Gothenburg, who led the study, in a &lt;a href="https://www.gu.se/en/news/viking-skulls-reveal-severe-morbidity"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Exactly why we don’t know. While we can’t study the damage in the soft tissue because it’s no longer there, we can see the traces left in the skeletal structures.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;What they found sounds perfectly hellish. As the scientists &lt;a href="https://www.gu.se/en/news/viking-skulls-reveal-severe-morbidity"&gt;detailed&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;BDJ Open&lt;/em&gt;, of the 15 skulls, 12 showed signs of periapical lesions—a type of bacterial infection at the root of a tooth. Ten had some form of periodontal disease, including bone defects, bone loss, or furcation involvement, an infection so severe that it causes a loss of mass in the jaw bone where the roots meet. Other issues found in multiple skulls included poorly healed or malformed jaw bones and one Viking skull showed signs of hardened tissue near the temporal bone, which may indicate an ear infection that spread.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, given that toothpaste wasn’t invented until hundreds of years later, only six of the Vikings studied were missing teeth before they died.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The study offers a small glimpse into what everyday life may have been like for Vikings 1,000 years ago, a time with no modern pain relief medications, antibiotics, or dental care. Infections “could stick around for a long time,” said Bertilsson.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bertilsson said she hopes that other scientists use the CT scan technique, which doesn’t harm or degrade the human remains, in their own research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Very many of today’s archaeological methods are invasive, with the need to remove bone or other tissue for analysis,” she said. “This way, we can keep the remains completely intact yet still extract a great deal of information.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Prior research showed that some Vikings did pay attention to their teeth, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/fierce-fashionable-vikings-filed-their-teeth-and-irone-5819286"&gt;filing them to points&lt;/a&gt; and filling them with pigment. Cool? Yes, definitely. Something an oral hygienist would recommend? No, probably not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

At least 16 people have been admitted to the hospital. Nine cases of measles have also been reported in the neighboring state of New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;According to officials at the Texas Department of State Health Services, the outbreak has been concentrated in the northwest of the state. At least 77 of these cases are in children, with 26 being 4 years old or younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that can be deadly. Early symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, and conjunctivitis. It is usually distinguished by white spots on the inside of the mouth as well as a generalized rash all over the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-hnJNtl gxMaIG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;According to the &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.paho.org/es/temas/sarampion#:~:text=El%20primer%20signo%20del%20sarampi%C3%B3n,cara%20interna%20de%20las%20mejillas." class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.paho.org/es/temas/sarampion#:~:text=El%20primer%20signo%20del%20sarampi%C3%B3n,cara%20interna%20de%20las%20mejillas."}' href="https://www.paho.org/es/temas/sarampion#:~:text=El%20primer%20signo%20del%20sarampi%C3%B3n,cara%20interna%20de%20las%20mejillas." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pan American Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, measles once killed 2.6 million people a year worldwide, with 12,000 of these victims being in the Americas. The first measles vaccine arrived in 1963, and following its rollout in the US, cases across the country &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.idsociety.org/public-health/measles/know-the-facts/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.idsociety.org/public-health/measles/know-the-facts/"}' href="https://www.idsociety.org/public-health/measles/know-the-facts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fell by 97 percent&lt;/a&gt; between 1965 and 1968. Massive &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/vaccines/"&gt;worldwide vaccination campaigns&lt;/a&gt; then spread these gains across the globe. Between 1980 and 2015, worldwide cases fell by 95 percent thanks to the combined vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), which is given in two doses starting at 1 year of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;However, skepticism about the effects of vaccines, including MMR, has spread throughout the world. For example, the current outbreak in Texas has centered around Gaines County, which has one of the highest vaccine exemption rates in the state (&lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/conscientious-exemptions" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/conscientious-exemptions"}' href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/conscientious-exemptions" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;18 percent&lt;/a&gt;). Many of the patients are children whose parents chose not to immunize them against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;While most states in the US require students to have the MMR vaccine to attend school, some states allow families to request an exemption from vaccination for their children, even for nonmedical reasons. Texas is one such state. In the current outbreak, 85 of the 90 measles cases are in unvaccinated people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“We respect everyone’s right to get vaccinated or not,” Albert Pilkington, CEO of the Seminole Hospital District in Gaines Country, told the Texas Standard. “That’s what being an American is all about, isn’t it?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In 2024, 285 measles cases were reported in the United States, the highest number since 2019. Forty-two percent were children under the age of 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The outlook for preventing this disease is not bright. The measles outbreak in Texas comes just a week after &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/robert-f-kennedy-jr/"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; was confirmed as head of the US Department of Health and Human Services. RFK Jr. rose to prominence first as an environmental advocate and then as a &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/rfk-jr-senate-testimony-is-haunted-by-his-track-record-robert-f-kennedy/"&gt;notorious anti-vaccine activist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Kennedy has repeatedly spread vaccine misinformation—for example, that autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are caused by, among other factors, harmful agents in vaccines. In 2021 he was named by the Center for Countering Digital Hate as one of the &lt;a data-offer-url="https://counterhate.com/research/the-disinformation-dozen/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://counterhate.com/research/the-disinformation-dozen/"}' href="https://counterhate.com/research/the-disinformation-dozen/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“Disinformation Dozen”&lt;/a&gt;—one of 12 leading online anti-vaxxers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Neither Robert F.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;]Eating an orange a day may lower a person's depression risk by 20%, according to a &lt;a href="https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-024-01961-3" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;i&gt;Microbiome&lt;/i&gt;. That might be because citrus stimulates the growth of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii), a type of bacteria found in the human gut, to influence production of the neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine—two biological molecules known to elevate mood.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The study was led by Raaj Mehta, an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School and a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital. In this edited conversation with the Gazette, Mehta discusses key takeaways from the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What inspired this study?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was working with a fantastic postdoc named Chatpol Samuthpongtorn, who was reading through the literature on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/depression/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, looking for an interesting project to take on. And he came across this &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522045932" target="_blank"&gt;one paper&lt;/a&gt; from 2016 that pointed to the possibility that citrus lowers the risk of depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That piqued our interest because we had access to a rich data set that we could use to follow up on this finding. It's called the &lt;a href="https://nurseshealthstudy.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Nurses' Health Study II (NHS2)&lt;/a&gt;, and it began in 1989 with the goal of finding risk factors for major chronic diseases in women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It involves more than 100,000 women, and roughly every two years they provide researchers with detailed information about their lifestyle, diet, medication use, and health. So we decided to leverage these data to look for evidence that nurses who ate a lot of citrus had lower rates of future depression than those who did not. And that's what we found!&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;How big an effect is this? Does it compare to traditional antidepressants?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that eating one medium orange a day may lower the risk of developing depression by about 20%. And the effect seems to be specific to citrus. When we look at people's total fruit or vegetable consumption, or at other individual fruits such as apples or bananas, we don't see any relationship between intake and risk of depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to compare the effectiveness of citrus to traditional antidepressants, such as &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/ssris/art-20044825" target="_blank"&gt;selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors&lt;/a&gt;, because we're talking about preventing depression, and those drugs are usually used to treat depression once a person is already experiencing it. In the future, eating citrus could perhaps be part of a strategy for managing depression that also involves these more traditional pharmaceuticals. But more research is needed before we can conclude that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So walk me through the logic. How exactly do you think eating oranges lowers the risk of depression?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One unique part of the study is that a subset of participants in the NHS2 gave researchers several samples of their stool over the course of a year. Using DNA sequencing results from these stool samples, we looked for links between citrus intake and particular species of bacteria in the gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One species of bacteria stood out—F. prausnitzii was more abundant in people who were not depressed than people who were, and consuming a lot of citrus was also associated with high levels of F. prausnitzii. So we think this bacterium may link citrus consumption with good mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the NHS2 only includes women, we wanted to confirm the findings in a study involving men. So we turned to a similar study, called the Men's Lifestyle Validation Study, where we also saw increasing levels of F. prausnitzii were inversely correlated with depression risk scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then the question became, how is F. prausnitzii making people feel better? One answer, we think, might be that these bacteria use a metabolic pathway known as the S-adenosyl-L-methionine cycle I pathway to influence levels of two neurotransmitters—serotonin and &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22581-dopamine" target="_blank"&gt;dopamine&lt;/a&gt;—produced by human cells in the gut. These neurotransmitters regulate how food passes through the digestive tract, but they can also travel to the brain, where they elevate mood.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Were you surprised by the findings?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes and no. There's so much evidence now suggesting a strong link between the gut and the brain that I was not surprised to find more. At the same time, I had not associated citrus with the brain before we got these results. You often hear that fish is "brain food," but nobody says that oranges are brain food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, F. prausnitzii has been linked to good health in lots of ways, like by lowering the risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease. But I wasn't aware of a link between F. prausnitzii and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next for this research?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to see a clinical trial done to definitively show that eating citrus can lower the risk of depression, or maybe even alleviate the condition in some cases. There's such a huge unmet need for depression treatments, and eating citrus doesn't really have any major side effects, so it would be great to see how much this simple treatment can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More broadly, I hope our results inspire other researchers to look into the link between diet and mental health. I think people know intuitively that the foods we eat impact our mood. We even have a term for this: comfort foods, which make us feel better in the short term. But researchers are just starting to understand the specifics.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The National Health Service (NHS) paid a six-figure compensation to an unnamed woman after she developed a crippling &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; addiction after the side effects of a prescription drug impaired her impulse control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medicine (intended to treat restless leg syndrome and Parkinson’s) is in a class of drugs known as dopamine agonists. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter responsible for feelings of reward, and the artificial increase caused by these drugs can make someone seek out more of it — and that’s something mobile games excel at providing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small rewards, like opening a &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/hoyoverse-facing-20m-fine-over-loot-box-mechanics/"&gt;loot box&lt;/a&gt;, receiving a new item, or just finishing a level, all generate a boost of dopamine in the brain. Within weeks of her prescription, the woman began to “obsessively” play &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; before progressing to virtual slot machine games.&lt;/p&gt;

She has since been granted £170,000 (roughly $215,000) in compensation from the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_3166962" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3166962" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-dt-lazy-src="https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Candy-Crush-Saga.webp?fit=720%2C432&amp;amp;p=1" decoding="async" class=" size-large wp-image-3166962 h-lightbox is-zoomable dt-lazy-load dt-lazy-pending" alt="Candy Crush Saga being played on a web browser or tablet."&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-3166962" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;King&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time a situation like this has arisen. Another man was prescribed the same medication, and then went on to lose more than £100,000 in online gambling. The NHS covered those costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No update has been given on how either of the two patients are doing. Suggested treatment to correct the loss of impulse control is a gradual reduction of the dosage before switching to a different type of medication, as well as other medications and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; isn’t to blame for the situation, but it does reveal the risks of games designed to hook the player in with rapid rewards — especially on individuals who are more susceptible to gaming addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/who-gaming-disorder/"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; has considered video game addiction a mental health disorder since 2013. Though numerous studies have been conducted, the results remain unclear as conclusions vary across different groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another Indiana county is reporting its first case of chronic wasting disease (CWD), less than a year after the state's first detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2.5-year-old white-tailed buck in &lt;a href="https://events.in.gov/event/second-positive-case-of-chronic-wasting-disease-confirmed-in-indiana?utm_campaign=widget&amp;amp;utm_medium=widget&amp;amp;utm_source=State+of+Indiana"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Posey County&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tested positive after being harvested by a hunter, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR) said in a news release late last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The county is in the southwestern part of Indiana, on the border with CWD-positive Illinois and CWD-positive Kentucky, the far opposite of &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/chronic-wasting-disease/indiana-confirms-its-first-chronic-wasting-disease-detection"&gt;&lt;span&gt;LaGrange County&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where the state's first case was discovered in April 2024. LaGrange County abuts CWD-positive Michigan. The other state that borders Indiana, Ohio, has also reported cases of the fatal neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 2025-2026 deer hunting season, DNR will enhance its surveillance efforts in Posey County and the surrounding counties to determine the extent of disease in this area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"During the 2025-2026 deer hunting season, DNR will enhance its surveillance efforts in Posey County and the surrounding counties to determine the extent of disease in this area," the DNR said. "This will allow biologists to develop a targeted response based on the prevalence of CWD in this part of Indiana. CWD testing will be voluntary for hunters in this area."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cooking doesn't neutralize prions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CWD, a disease of cervids such as deer, moose, and elk, is caused by infectious misfolded proteins called prions, which spread through direct contact and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease isn't known to infect people, but some experts fear it could cause illness similar to another prion disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("mad cow" disease). The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns against eating meat from infected animals, as cooking temperatures cannot deactivate prions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It's much easier to vape continuously because you can do it in places where smoking might be less acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"What we have found is the dangers for someone who keeps vaping are no different from smokers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;It's a groundbreaking study (Getty Stock Photo)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;For the study, the team tracked volunteers with the average age of 27 who had similar fitness levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The study suggested people who smoked and vape had damaged artery walls that could no longer dilate properly - which could lead to cardiovascular problems further down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;They also found smokers and vapers' blood flow was impaired, putting them at risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Dr Boidin added: "When you put this mixture of metals and chemicals into your body you can't expect nothing to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"The only benefit of vaping is to help people quit smoking, but if they keep vaping the result is going to be the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"I think doctors should be able to prescribe vapes for a certain time, so they could be used as a transition tool, but only for a short time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Because the use of vaping is relatively new, experts remain unsure of the long-term impacts of vaping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>UNILAD</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 16:41:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxQUzhFNndZUE1qQkxMa0lGSWFPbDB2ZzZHeWY3UGdNb3YzTXE4Mzk0VkhHTmRIVkJ5d1daS0VhMUJad3hFTkpwdlZLVndMR3pfQ0ZQa0JMclM2d3liQ1h5UzJaUlNXcTJxcHh4cUZkSlZOTC0taWM3b1RFcUpMUEdQcTFLam9QVV9WVklkX3hyWQ</guid></item><item><title>U.S. joins WHO-led flu vaccine meeting, despite planned withdrawal from agency - STAT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTFB4RVh4YmRFckMydVZPOVFTUUFwZWJQRjB2N1lqNDM3S3N6Mlk4WE1kYzFIWXNSb3VlSkx2MXZ1RDU3aXVZV2FMbllUZ3JFVVJuQ3VUMUxpMnRSZ1RxWVlmMThhVG1rSlRYYXdOdWR5M1c0cW9lbkV1ZnRB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two U.S. government agencies that are key players in the World Health Organization-led process to select the flu viruses for next winter’s influenza vaccines are participating in a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/13/who-flu-vaccine-strain-selection/"&gt;meeting to discuss the issue&lt;/a&gt;, despite the Trump administration’s plans to withdraw from the global health agency, sources told STAT.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not announce its plans to participate in advance but confirmed its role Monday in an email response to STAT.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“CDC will be actively participating virtually at the WHO vaccine consultation meeting for the recommendation of viruses for 2025-26 Northern Hemisphere vaccine this week,” CDC spokesperson Benjamin Haynes said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The weeklong meeting began Monday, with experts from both the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration in virtual attendance. With the exception of Haynes, all sources who spoke with STAT for this article requested they not be identified by name because they hadn’t been authorized to speak. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To attend the meeting, even virtually, the two agencies would have had to receive an exemption from the Trump administration due to its &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/27/cdc-ordered-stop-working-with-world-health-organization/"&gt;ban on all interactions with the WHO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;President Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/20/trump-order-us-withdrawal-world-health-organization-historic-policy-shift/"&gt;announcing that the United States will withdraw from the WHO&lt;/a&gt;. And since the earliest days of the new administration, government agencies have been ordered to cease all dealings with the Geneva-based global health agency, and to halt the dispersal of all funding to it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The flu strain selection meeting, though, would have created a quandary for the administration. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Twice a year, experts from around the world gather to determine which strains of flu should be in the next version of flu vaccines. The vaccines take months to make, bottle, and distribute, so these meetings typically take place toward the end of one flu season to prepare for the next.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This week’s meeting, for the 2025-2026 Northern Hemisphere flu vaccines, is being held at the Francis Crick Institute in London. The meeting for the Southern Hemisphere 2026 flu vaccine will be held in September.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to making recommendations on the viruses seasonal flu vaccines should target, the group also reviews what is happening with flu viruses like H5N1 bird flu and other flu viruses that pose a pandemic risk. The goal of these discussions is to determine if existing candidate vaccine viruses — effectively seed strains with which to make vaccines to target these novel viruses — are still effective or should be updated. Some countries, notably the United States, make and stockpile supplies of vaccines to use in the event that some of these flu viruses circulating in birds or animals begin to transmit among humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The decisions are made by experts from seven WHO collaborating centers on influenza and four essential regulatory laboratories, located in Australia, China, Japan, Russian, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The CDC is one of the collaborating centers and the FDA one of the essential regulatory labs, giving U.S. government scientists two of the 11 votes — though decisions are made by consensus rather than straight votes. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The CDC stopped contributing influenza data to two WHO-managed databases, FluNet and FluID, on Jan. 24, Maria Van Kerkhove, acting director of the WHO’s department of epidemic and pandemic threat management, said recently. Data from earlier in the flu season had already been shared, but in a process designed to predict what’s going to happen months from now, the viruses that are circulating now are more relevant than reports on what circulated months ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ban on interacting with the WHO left in doubt whether the CDC and FDA scientists would be allowed to attend the strain selection meeting, which in turn raised questions about how the FDA would instruct suppliers of flu vaccines for the U.S. market what it believes next winter’s shots should target. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The FDA typically holds a meeting of its expert panel, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, in March to go over the discussions that arose at the WHO strain selection meeting and finalize choices for the vaccines to be used in this country. It is currently unclear whether VRBPAC will meet next month. Many meetings of advisory committees have been canceled or postponed without rescheduling, since the new administration took office, including one of the CDC’s advisory committee, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/acip-cdc-vaccine-meeting-postponed/"&gt;which was meant to meet this week&lt;/a&gt;. There are &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;no upcoming VRBPAC meetings&lt;/a&gt; listed on the FDA’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

An individual from Gaines County who tested positive for the virus visited the university’s main campus, Ripley’s Believe It or Not, Mr. Crabby’s Seafood and Bar and other tourist locations, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The department said that anyone at those locations in the hours between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. CST and at the restaurant between 6 and 8 p.m. should monitor for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Measles is a highly contagious virus that can lead to serious complications, especially in young children and individuals with weakened immune systems. If you think you may have been exposed or are showing symptoms, please contact your healthcare provider immediately,” Metro Health Deputy Director Dr. Anita Kurian said in a &lt;a href="https://www.sa.gov/Directory/News/News-Releases/Possible-Measles-Exposures-in-San-Antonio" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:statement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So far, 99 people have been sickened in the outbreak across Texas and New Mexico, leading to a coordinated response from health authorities who are concerned about how many cases have yet to be detected across the region. Many of the cases have come among unvaccinated people as health officials stress the importance of the vaccine to prevent against the disease that has been eradicated in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major measles outbreak has infected nearly 100 people across Texas and New Mexico this year. Health officials believe that more cases will be confirmed (AP)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In San Marcos, less than an hour away from San Antonio, a Gaines County resident visited Texas State University and the Twin Peaks Restaurant on February 14. People near the university from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. and at the restaurant from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. may be at risk of developing measles, health officials warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People in those areas during those times or up to two hours later should monitor for symptoms. The Hays County Health Department said that those who may have been exposed will be notified by their local health authority. State agencies are working together to investigate potential contacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Measles is a highly contagious airborne disease spread by contact with an infected person through coughing and sneezing. Texas is currently experiencing the largest outbreak of measles in decades,” &lt;a href="https://www.hayscountytx.gov/possible-measles-exposure-in-san-marcos" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:noted;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; Hays County Local Health Authority Dr. John Turner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As of last Friday - the state’s latest &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-21-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:update;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; - there were 90 cases reported since January. Sixteen people have been hospitalized and five of the cases were among the vaccinated. Additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area, the Department of State Health Services warned. Of those 90, 57 were in Gaines County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can survive in the air for up to two hours. People in San Antonio and San Marco who were exposed to a positive case are being asked to monitor themselves for symptoms, such as a fever and a rash (AP)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But, the outbreak is no longer just impacting Texas residents. There are now &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nine cases;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;nine cases&lt;/a&gt; reported in neighboring New Mexico’s Lea County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The majority of cases in both states are in younger people, between the ages of five and 17 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles, which can survive in the air for up to two hours, can cause serious illness and death. Infections can lead to brain swelling and blindness. And, up to nine out of 10 of those susceptible will get the virus if they have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The best way to prevent infection is two doses of a vaccine against measles. Clinics have been set up in response to the threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Individuals who have not been vaccinated are at greater risk of infection. To minimize the risk of infection and serious illness, individuals should make sure they are vaccinated,” Turner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 16:10:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxPV2R3MFYwM3dZWnZMZG04eDFjOS1pVzJIQkNKQ1Bic3c0SDI4eHJhTWZtN0QzUEdSaUZYQi1weG84b1YzSUhNa0d0RmhvdHd1cDI1SzhrYnFqcDZua0pQaVNjT1FZZDk1VGFMUWVpQXpZQTRpODRHOGQ3SUNaQWM0VmVCMA</guid></item><item><title>Subtle change to your breathing that could be a sign of Alzheimer's disease - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxON1Q4eEVRd2EyUHJuNnl5RVpsMVJvaGhwbDU3Rk5WdTA5S0J3VHRKR0JFamtQOFE5SGg4YlZENWlKZFJFd091UnlGbjgxLVhZOWFCNkNBZWRJdmtmYXB6ZXAzM1oyU0dqSGZWTmFwOG81NUJBaEZBQ2F5NC1wcUxJbkRhLWJsS09LN0JvVHpCZlRHU0HSAZgBQVVfeXFMTkRkQ3ZXanc1V1V6b2JDUlB4emVrVUdHWkYyR3RNczBucW5scWVQVlo0ellxbG1CZy16eEJHekZpdVFiOXJVYkpvOXBPSU0wMU9VanZfZXlMWHRFUE9FOEVlRy1LbHZ3QnFkSnJscVFDbTBxX2htOU5mUnJMZjFPN1dlYWNsWE94U09lLTJLWDZTWGlmOXl3SGs?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most recent findings from the Lancaster University study have been published in the journal Brain Communications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study previously suggested that Alzheimer's could be stopped or even reversed by putting patients in oxygen chambers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Israeli researchers studied six older people with mild cognitive impairment, an early stage of memory loss that is a pre-cursor to the most common form of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their symptoms improved after having five 90-minute oxygen treatments a week for three months, scientists found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The treatment - called hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) - involves patients inhaling oxygen through a mask in a pressurized chamber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is used by athletes to help them recover quicker and celebrities who claim it beats stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It significantly increases the amount of oxygen in bodily tissues, which advocates say encourages healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And when the treatment was administered to mice, it removed amyloid plaques from the brain, which are a tell-tale sign of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts believe the therapy works by changing the structure of vessels in the brain and increases blood flow. Reduced blood flow to the brain has already been linked with the onset of dementia.&lt;span&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;There will be 3.2m new cases and 1.1m deaths a year worldwide by 2050 if current trends continue, the study found. In the UK, cases are expected to rise from 58,756 cases a year in 2022 to 71,006 cases a year in 2050. Deaths will jump from 12,122 a year in 2022 to 17,261 in 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The findings were &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03502-3" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in the journal Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Every minute, four women are diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide and one woman dies from the disease, and these statistics are worsening,” said the IARC scientist Dr Joanne Kim, one of the authors of the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Countries can mitigate or reverse these trends by adopting primary prevention policies … and by investing in early detection and treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The projected increase in cases worldwide is probably due to a mix of factors, including a growing and ageing global population, improvements in detection and diagnosis, and a higher prevalence of known risk factors for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Factors that increase the risk of breast cancer include getting older, inherited faulty genes and a family history of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Globally, most breast cancer cases and deaths occur in women aged 50 and above, who account for 71% of new cases and 79% of deaths, the IARC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;About a quarter of breast cancer cases can be prevented, the study’s authors said, for example by reducing alcohol intake, maintaining a healthy weight and becoming more active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women worldwide but its burden is not evenly distributed. The IARC said diagnosis rates were highest in Australia and New Zealand, followed by North America and northern Europe, and lowest in Asia and Africa. However, death rates were highest in Melanesia and Polynesia, and in west Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Over the last decade, incidence rates grew by 1% to 5% a year in 27 of 50 countries studied, the IARC said. Importantly, breast cancer mortality rates decreased in 29 of 46 countries analysed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Dr Isabelle Soerjomataram, the deputy head of the IARC’s cancer surveillance branch, said: “Continued progress in early diagnosis and improved access to treatment are essential to address the global gap in breast cancer and ensure that the goal of reducing suffering and death from breast cancer is achieved by all countries worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 16:08:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPLVRuWElWVG9zU1k2aG9kVnAtNE9JcVNxXzFCd2NlZlY1eHMwSXRKOGdDMWxwalRTcUhKcXd5YWxYZng1ZDhOTlVRZVFXbDVpZVZSTGhpOTdXR01xMzZuZGhlY0Q4ajZJZVZseG5zeHNEQzhHallQLXNYcWlveFZBYkgwdldsUGJydW00bE9iN3lHZlhiRHRQM3cyMmt3Yjg</guid></item><item><title>Three more Indiana farms quarantined due to Avian Flu - WBIW.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxOYnpxMnlxOTVzcmdyVFhpLTdrNy1tbU9wbXJJb0V0NXpkMjJCclpRUlNmdlU2bzk1cVl2R0EzUEpyTVdFSFFjWXRhMVlZZVZ6SzZFZGVFcmFyMTZDT2gxWTZ5aFNMd2xFUy1jcTNGc0hPZVR6QkpUMVdKY182M2VjZWVOZ3BsaDcyQlRaTEM2cw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body class="post-template-default single single-post postid-327389 single-format-standard custom-background wp-custom-logo elegantwp-animated elegantwp-fadein nws-alerts-bar-enabled unselectable elegantwp-group-blog" id="readabilityBody" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebPage"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Findings also showed the volume of bone erosion increased by 7% per year, and was 3.5 times higher for women who had gone through menopause. However, the presence of bone erosions or the volume of lost bone was not associated with disease activity, damage scores, or functional disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The findings of this study demonstrate a high prevalence of joint erosions in patients with [Sjögren’s disease], challenging the traditional view of [Sjögren’s] as a non-erosive disease,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0049017225000150"&gt;Associations of local bone involvement with disease activity, damage and functional disability in Sjögren’s disease: A cross-sectional study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Seminars in Arthritis and Rheumatism&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/causes-of-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;Sjögren’s disease is caused &lt;/a&gt;when the immune system mistakenly launches an inflammatory attack against the glands that produce tears and saliva, although other tissues and organs may also be affected. This leads to the hallmark &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/symptoms-of-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;Sjögren’s symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, which include of eye and mouth dryness and joint inflammation that may cause bone erosion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Observational study is 1st of its kind&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Brazil conducted an observational study to assess the relationship between bone erosions and clinical parameters of Sjögren’s using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). “This is the first study to assess joint and bone involvement in a large cohort of patients with [Sjögren’s disease] using a highly sensitive bone assessment technology,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Although joint erosions are common, they do not appear to be clinically relevant,” the researchers wrote. “Nevertheless, patients with [Sjögren’s disease] do develop these erosions, and there is likely to be an inflammatory joint component that may be associated with other factors such as age, comorbidities, or poorer disease control.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A total of 106 women with a mean age of 49.6 who had been living with Sjögren’s for a median of seven years were involved in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 100 patients who underwent high-resolution musculoskeletal ultrasound in the hands and wrists, 58% showed signs of inflammation in the joint membrane, while 20% had inflammation in the tissues that protect tendons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than half (56.7%) of the patients assessed for joint involvement had bone erosions in the joints of the fingers, with a mean volume of lost bone of 5.71 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. For reference, in a group of 60 healthy women, who had been matched for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI; a measure of body fat based on height and weight), the mean volume of lost bone was of 0.38 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some 7.2% of the patients had osteophytes, or bone spurs, in finger joints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, patients with bone erosions were significantly older and had higher levels of vitamin D than those without bone loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no differences between the two groups regarding BMI, disease duration and activity, menopause, other clinical parameters, medications used, and systemic bone involvement, including bone mineral density, structure, and strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among patients with erosions, the volume of lost bone was correlated with age, BMI, time since diagnosis, disease disability and damage scores, blood sugar levels, and the levels of a marker of bone loss called CTX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The median volume of lost bone was higher in women who had gone through menopause (8.8 mm&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;vs. 1.5 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), in those with higher damage (6.1mm&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;vs. 2.1 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), and in those with osteophytes (28mm&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;vs. 2.9 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This study shows a higher prevalence of bone erosions in [Sjögren’s disease] than previously described, particularly in older, postmenopausal women,” the researchers wrote, adding that the findings “highlight the potential of HR-pQCT as a sensitive tool to detect joint damage in [Sjögren’s disease].”&lt;/p&gt;

In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr. Tanu Gupta, physician and diabetologist, founder PeachX Health said, “In today’s fast-paced world, refined sugar is omnipresent; from breakfast cereals and bakery goods to beverages, flooding our diets in amounts far beyond our bodies’ capacity to metabolise it. This excessive sugar intake disrupts the gut microbiome, overwhelms metabolic pathways, and sets off a cascade of hormonal imbalances.” &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="manualbacklink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/anxiety-to-infertility-nutritionist-shares-8-hidden-ways-sugar-may-be-ruining-womens-health-101740050243924.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anxiety to infertility: Nutritionist shares 8 hidden ways sugar may be ruining women's health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=""&gt; &lt;span class=""&gt; &lt;picture&gt; &lt;source media="(max-width:767px)" srcset="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/02/24/550x309/sugar_1740408636321_1740408636841.jpg" alt='"Excessive sugar intake disrupts the gut microbiome, overwhelms metabolic pathways, and sets off a cascade of hormonal imbalances," said Dr Tanu Gupta.(Pexels)' title='"Excessive sugar intake disrupts the gut microbiome, overwhelms metabolic pathways, and sets off a cascade of hormonal imbalances," said Dr Tanu Gupta.(Pexels)'&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/02/24/550x309/sugar_1740408636321_1740408636841.jpg" alt='"Excessive sugar intake disrupts the gut microbiome, overwhelms metabolic pathways, and sets off a cascade of hormonal imbalances," said Dr Tanu Gupta.(Pexels)' title='"Excessive sugar intake disrupts the gut microbiome, overwhelms metabolic pathways, and sets off a cascade of hormonal imbalances," said Dr Tanu Gupta.(Pexels)'&gt; &lt;/picture&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;"Excessive sugar intake disrupts the gut microbiome, overwhelms metabolic pathways, and sets off a cascade of hormonal imbalances," said Dr Tanu Gupta.(Pexels)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p id="readMoreFTUser"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How sugar intake can affect gut health:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explaining sugar impact on our gut, Dr. Tanu Gupta said, “When we consume too much sugar, our digestive system experiences dysbiosis—a reduction in beneficial bacteria like Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus while harmful bacteria flourish. This imbalance not only impairs digestion but also weakens the gut barrier, allowing toxins and bacteria to leak into the bloodstream and trigger systemic inflammation. Chronic inflammation is a known precursor to metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.” Also read | &lt;a class="manualbacklink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/attack-on-sugar-unfair-fitness-experts-reveal-why-sugar-is-absolutely-safe-for-human-health-101717253756056.html"&gt;Attack on sugar unfair?

Elevated blood sugar forces the pancreas to produce excess insulin, which in turn disrupts the balance of sex hormones. In young women and even children, this can lead to conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), marked by irregular menstrual cycles, increased androgen levels, and early reproductive issues.” &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="manualbacklink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/diabetes-too-much-sugar-is-damaging-our-heart-liver-and-brain-a-nutritionist-explains-how-101674282493828.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diabetes: Too much sugar is damaging our heart, liver and brain; a nutritionist explains how&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Can we consume fruits in empty stomach?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although fruits are nutrient-rich, they contain natural sugars—primarily fructose—that are rapidly absorbed when eaten alone. In individuals with an already overloaded liver due to high dietary sugar, this sudden fructose influx can contribute to liver congestion. This condition, characterized by an overburdened liver struggling to detoxify and metabolize excess sugars, further compounds metabolic stress and inflammation,” the diabetologist explained.

Slow-wave sleep (SWS), the deepest stage of non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, is particularly important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;During SWS, the brain clears metabolic waste through the glymphatic system, flushing out toxins like Aβ. When SWS is disrupted, this clearance process weakens, leading to an accumulation of harmful proteins. Studies indicate that reductions in SWS are linked to increased &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/bacteria-in-your-mouth-linked-to-memory-and-dementia-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dementia risk&lt;/a&gt; over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;REM sleep, known as the dream stage, is equally important but less understood in relation to Alzheimer’s. REM sleep is involved in processing emotions and storing long-term memories. Emerging evidence suggests that people who experience less REM sleep, or take longer to reach it, may be at a higher risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="delayed_rem_sleep_and_alzheimer_s_risk"&gt;Delayed REM Sleep and Alzheimer’s Risk&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study conducted at the China-Japan Friendship Hospital in Beijing followed 128 participants with an average age of 70, including individuals with Alzheimer’s, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal cognition. The researchers monitored the participants’ sleep overnight, tracking brain activity, heart rate, breathing, and eye movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that those who took longer to reach REM sleep were more likely to have Alzheimer’s and had higher levels of amyloid and tau proteins. On average, individuals in the delayed REM group took over 193 minutes to reach REM sleep, while those with earlier REM sleep transitions took less than 98 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The delayed REM group showed 16% more amyloid, 29% more tau, and 39% less brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein essential for brain health. BDNF levels typically drop in Alzheimer’s, making this finding particularly significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Delays in REM sleep disrupt the brain’s ability to consolidate memories by interfering with processes that contribute to learning and memory,” said Yue Leng, PhD, an associate professor in the &lt;a href="https://psych.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at UCSF&lt;/a&gt;. “If REM sleep is insufficient or delayed, it may increase the stress hormone cortisol, impairing the hippocampus, a structure critical for memory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Scatter matrix plots of AD/ADRD biomarkers and sleep architectures.

Some medications, such as melatonin, can enhance REM sleep and have been shown in animal studies to reduce tau and amyloid buildup. Other drugs that treat insomnia by blocking chemicals that suppress REM sleep have demonstrated similar effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Future research should study the effects of certain medications that influence sleep patterns, as these may modify disease progression,” Leng said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People concerned about Alzheimer’s risk should consider improving sleep habits to enhance the transition from light sleep to REM sleep.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from McMaster University and collaborating institutions found that commonly performed interventional procedures for chronic non-cancer spine pain may provide little to no pain relief when compared with sham procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Chronic spine pain, defined as persistent pain along or referred from the spine lasting three months or longer, presents a global health challenge with significant socioeconomic implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While interventional procedures such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/epidural+steroid+injections/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;epidural steroid injections&lt;/a&gt;, nerve blocks, and radiofrequency nerve ablation are frequently used, clinical guidelines have offered conflicting recommendations regarding their effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Common interventional procedures for chronic non-cancer spine pain: a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/systematic+review/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;systematic review&lt;/a&gt; and network meta-analysis of randomized trials," &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bmj-2024-079971" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;The BMJ&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted a comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and Web of Science, for spine pain procedural outcome efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighty-one &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/trials/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt; with 7,977 patients were included in meta-analyses out of 132 eligible studies. Patients with chronic axial or radicular spine pain were randomized to receive common interventional procedures or comparators, including sham procedures and usual care. Frequentist network &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/meta-analyses/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;meta-analyses&lt;/a&gt; were performed, and the GRADE approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;For chronic axial spine pain, moderate certainty evidence showed that epidural injection of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/local+anesthetic/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;local anesthetic&lt;/a&gt;, epidural injection of local anesthetic and steroids, and joint-targeted steroid injection, result in little to no difference in pain relief compared with sham procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low certainty evidence suggests minimal pain relief differences for intramuscular and joint-targeted injections of local anesthetic, with or without steroids. Intramuscular injection of local anesthetic with steroids signaled that it may actually increase pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For chronic radicular &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/spine/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;spine&lt;/a&gt; pain, moderate certainty evidence indicates that epidural injection of local anesthetic and steroids and radiofrequency of the dorsal root ganglion are unlikely to result in pain relief. Low certainty evidence suggests epidural injections of local anesthetic or steroids may also yield minimal pain relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In physical functioning, moderate certainty evidence shows joint-targeted injections and epidural injections with local anesthetic or steroids probably provide little to no improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low certainty evidence suggests certain procedures may slightly increase the risk of non-serious adverse events, including joint radiofrequency ablation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking at the substantial cost, inconvenience, and false hope of these common procedures compared to data that suggests they are ineffective, it is unclear why they have persisted. If the study results are valid, another issue suggested is a major communication disconnect regarding procedures and patient outcomes in health care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined immune responses against more than 23,000 human proteins, and the MLC1 protein emerged as one of the top hit proteins targeted by immune B-cells derived from MS patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/NXI.0000000000200374"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Modulator of VRAC Current 1 Is a Potential Target Antigen in Multiple Sclerosis,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” was published in &lt;em&gt;Neurology Neuroimmunology and Neuroinflammation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/risk-factors-for-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;MS is caused&lt;/a&gt; by inflammation that damages nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. While the mechanisms that drive that inflammation in MS aren’t fully understood, B-cells appear to play a major role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B-cells are a type of immune cell that produce antibodies, that is, proteins that attack specific molecular targets, known as antigens. While antibodies are essential for fighting infections and other threats, in MS, it’s believed that certain antibodies mistakenly attack antigens from healthy brain cells, triggering an erroneous immune response against those cells and causing nerve damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some proteins have been &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2023/10/18/ectrims-2023-new-research-may-explain-link-ebv-ms-development/"&gt;identified as possible antigens&lt;/a&gt; in MS, including the brain protein GlialCAM, there doesn’t seem to be one single target antigen for all cases of MS. Pinning down other antigens that may be targeted in MS might lead to more effective therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The target antigen of MS has long been a mystery and there seems to be no defined single target antigen,” Stefanie Kürten, PhD, co-author of the study at University Hospital Bonn in Germany, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.uni-bonn.de/en/news/031-2025"&gt;university news story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;A role for MLC1 in MS?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, researchers collected B-cells from 20 MS patients and nine people without the disease, then exposed the cells to more than 23,000 different human proteins. B-cells from MS patients had heightened antibody responses to a variety of proteins, results showed, but the protein MLC1 caught the researchers’ eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MLC1 (short for modulator of VRAC current 1) is found in nerve cells and astrocytes, or star-shaped cells that support nerve function. It’s known to physically interact with GlialCAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[MLC1] is a very interesting candidate because the protein is expressed on astrocytes and neurons. MLC1 is also a binding partner of GlialCAM,” said Alicia Weier, a doctoral student at the University of Bonn and co-first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyses of samples from separate subsets of people with or without MS confirmed the original findings, suggesting B-cells from MS patients are more reactive to MLC1 than B-cells from people without the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MS patients had higher levels of anti-MLC1 antibodies in their blood and in the fluid around their brains. Antibodies against MLC1 also were elevated in samples from people with other inflammatory neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a final set of tests, the researchers injected anti-MLC1 antibodies into mice with MS-like disease. The antibodies were found to bind strongly to cerebral cortical neurons, nerve cells in the brain’s outermost part. Also, four of the seven mice given anti-MLC1 antibodies died less than a day after being injected, whereas all the mice that weren’t given the antibodies survived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data suggest “anti-MLC1 antibodies played a role in aggravating disease severity,” wrote the researchers, who emphasized that more studies are needed to further explore the potential role of anti-MLC1 antibodies in MS. “Further experiments with a larger sample size will have to be performed to verify the findings regarding the [disease-causing ability] of MLC1-specific antibodies.”&lt;/p&gt;

So really, to have that extended healthspan," Andersen told Business Insider, using the term for how long a person is healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Living to an extreme age, like 105 and over, is likely about 70% down to a person's genetics, Andersen said, but &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-lifestyle-changes-live-longer-healthy-habits-genes-study-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;healthy habits&lt;/a&gt; appear to be the most important factor for living to our late 80s and early 90s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no one recipe for longevity, Andersen said, but following "the good, healthy behaviors that we know about and that are well tested" is the best approach to healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She shared the habits she's implemented into her life based on her research and meeting hundreds of centenarians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="c4356f32-1655-493a-ab94-8068b1b41377" data-toc-id="c4356f32-1655-493a-ab94-8068b1b41377"&gt;1) Eat five different colors a day&lt;/h2&gt;

                          &lt;p&gt;Andersen tries to eat five different colors of fruits and vegetables every day to ensure she gets a range of nutrients. "You're getting a wider variety, and it just feels good to check that box each day," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
                          
                          
                          
                                 
                          &lt;p&gt;Prioritizing fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and lean meats is crucial for healthy aging, she said and pointed to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/mediterranean-diet" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;Mediterranean-style diet&lt;/a&gt; as an example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the eating patterns of people in countries like Italy, Greece, and Turkey, the Mediterranean Diet has been ranked&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mediterranean-diet-best-healthy-eating-longevity-rankings-2025-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt; the healthiest way to eat&lt;/a&gt; for eight years running by US News &amp;amp; World Report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large 2023 study found that people who ate a whole-food-rich diet, similar to the Mediterranean Diet, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/foods-live-10-years-longer-longevity-diet-study-2023-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;lived up to a decade longer&lt;/a&gt; than those who ate a typical Western diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="af27d73a-0543-4c9e-ad67-2e19822f7390" data-toc-id="af27d73a-0543-4c9e-ad67-2e19822f7390"&gt;2) Exercise daily and mix it up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anderson aims to get some movement in every day. She mixes up her workouts, sometimes going on long hikes with her dog, and other times running on a treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typical centenarian is active, Andersen said. Many live on their own into their 90s, they often drive for an average of 10 years longer than their peers, and work for five years longer, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common workout the centenarians she has studied do is walking or stretching, but they also do a lot of informal exercise, such as housekeeping, gardening, and yard work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between longevity and an active lifestyle is well-established. A 2023 study by researchers at the University of Cambridge found a link between exercising for &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/short-walk-a-day-could-reduce-risk-early-death-study-2023-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;11 minutes a day&lt;/a&gt; and a lower risk of dying from chronic illnesses such as heart disease and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="6d928ae2-2729-44d2-85ae-e4ef4bf8c5bc" data-toc-id="6d928ae2-2729-44d2-85ae-e4ef4bf8c5bc"&gt;3) Get good-quality sleep&lt;/h2&gt;

It helps remove the proteins that are thought to to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="af7ed46a-a796-43f5-aed1-23285a62abb7" data-toc-id="af7ed46a-a796-43f5-aed1-23285a62abb7"&gt;4) Challenge yourself to learn a new skill&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andersen has taken up sailing, which she said challenges her both cognitively and physically. "I tell everyone, 'Whatever you've always wanted to do that's new, go and do that!'" she said. Several centenarians she has met took up painting in their later years, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing something that engages your brain and attention strengthens neural pathways and builds new ones, and is the number one thing we can do for brain health, she said. "Just doing crossword puzzles where you're retrieving information is probably not going to be that beneficial," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0153485" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal PLOS One by researchers at the University of Edinburgh, found that after just one week of intensive language learning, a group of 33 participants, aged between 18 and 78, had improved their ability to focus and switch between tasks. A control group of 34 participants who did an intensive course that didn't involve language learning also experienced cognitive benefits, but they weren't quite as significant, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;

Think of it like a stopwatch that measures how your body is aging internally, not just counting the years.” &lt;br&gt;— Austin Argentieri, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Nature" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03164-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;previous publication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, we built a proteomic aging clock by taking proteins in the blood and using machine learning to estimate (a) participant’s biological age. We showed that this proteomic aging clock is a powerful predictor of mortality and disease multimorbidity — it is a single measure associated with future risk of 18 major chronic diseases,” Argentieri explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We used the proteomic aging clock in this current paper because we wanted to identify exposures that are important for aging, and so we decided that we would only select exposures that were associated with both mortality and the proteomic age clock in consistent directions,” he continued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If an exposure was associated with mortality and the proteomic clock in different directions … then we would have excluded that exposure because it is implausible that an exposure could both increase risk of mortality but slow down aging (or vice versa). So in essence we used the proteomic aging clock to get a better sense of biological plausibility for each of the mortality-associated exposures,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the study’s conclusion, Argentieri and his team identified 25 lifestyle and environmental factors — 23 that they reported are modifiable — that were associated with mortality and proteomic aging, as well as aging biomarkers and major disease risk factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/299147" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Cheese consumption&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ease of &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-to-tan-safely" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;skin tanning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Education years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Employment status&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ethnicity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frequency of feeling tired&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gym use&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;History of financial difficulties&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Household income&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Physical activity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/sleep-calculator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Sleeping hours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smoking status&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Type of housing (i.e. house, apartment, mobile home, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using an open fire for heating&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weight and height at 10 years old&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers found that smoking, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and living conditions were the factors that had the most influence on mortality and biological aging. Smoking alone was associated with 21 diseases, and socioeconomic factors and tiredness frequency with 19 diseases.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This means that a few fundamental aspects of our environments and lives could possibly have a profound influence on whether we live a long healthy life. In a time when there is lots of attention paid to fancy new trends in wellness, it reminds us that getting back to basics will still possibly have the largest and most strategic impact on improving population health,” Argentieri explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, researchers attributed 17% of the variation in risk of death to environmental factors, compared to less than 2% explained by genetic predisposition for 22 major diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists also found that environmental exposures had a greater effect on lung, heart, and liver diseases, while genetic risk still dominated for &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/142214" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;dementias&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/37136" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This [d]emonstrates that our environments and lifestyle are almost 10 times more important in explaining mortality risk than our genetic predisposition for major diseases causes of death. It means that we have the power to have a major impact on preventing early mortality if we focus on improving our environmental and economic conditions.”&lt;br&gt;— Austin Argentieri, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research should give us all hope that aging is not fully predetermined in our genes, but it is something that is shaped in our environments. This means that we have the power to take our own health in our hands preventatively through not just changes to lifestyle but also through policy and intervention efforts aimed at reducing our exposures to harmful environments,” Argentieri said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; had the chance to speak with &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a board certified interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA, about this study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This population-based study found that environmental factors — such as physical inactivity and socioeconomic factors — play a much bigger role than genetic factors in the development of disease and early death. These findings reinforce what we understand about the significant health implications of many harmful environmental exposures such as smoking.” &lt;br&gt;— Cheng-Han Chen, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As most of the identified lifestyle and environmental factors are considered to (be) modifiable, there is a tremendous opportunity to reduce the global burden of disease by addressing and ameliorating these risk factors,” Chen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The environmental factors in this study explained only about 17% of the variation in the risk of death. There are clearly many more as-yet-unidentified risks to be addressed. Future research could utilize these study’s techniques to investigate other possible environmental risk factors (such as chemical exposures) for their contribution to disease,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also talked to &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/wael-harb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Wael Harb, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a board certified hematologist and medical oncologist at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, about this research. He said quantifying the extent to which modifiable factors impact biological aging and premature mortality underscores the importance of preventive strategies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study provides compelling evidence supporting the long-held understanding that lifestyle and environmental factors play a crucial role in determining health outcomes, often outweighing genetic predispositions. The finding that environmental exposures account for 17% of mortality risk compared to less than 2% from genetics is particularly striking and highlights the significant potential for public health interventions.” &lt;br&gt;— Wael Harb, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The next logical step would be to dive deeper into the specific mechanisms by which key environmental factors accelerate aging and contribute to disease. Longitudinal studies focusing on intervention strategies — such as &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/smoking-cessation-aids" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;smoking cessation&lt;/a&gt; programs, physical activity promotion, and improvements in socioeconomic conditions — would help validate whether modifying these exposures can indeed slow biological aging and reduce premature mortality,” Harb said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, integrating multi-omics data — genomics, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8473418/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;proteomics&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/metabolomics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;metabolomics&lt;/a&gt; — could offer a more comprehensive view of how environmental and genetic factors interplay, leading to more personalized approaches to preventive care,” he added. “It would also be valuable to replicate these findings in diverse populations to ensure the conclusions are broadly applicable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 14:38:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixAFBVV95cUxNalJfUnlYVDYtQTFja0UxNF9rX2s5S0dhWGdlOU9GSmJ6aXhvcEdGRG1DMHFMX0VzYnhpMFk5b01DQmxkNTJDVXpGUm5KVWVtZnBaX3RIWXBZNkdSbkJVZG1nV2RnY0l1eFlJOUd6dFRsNVV6Ujhnd25RYzNBNTJmNi13NGZBT284bTA3V3gxRFd6SjAtdDZvS0p4SllMVGNrenpOUEhQN0NLeGYwb2dmeHd5dUJMZFJYY1dUREl5M1NCaTNu</guid></item><item><title>Heart disease remains the top cause of death in the U.S. - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxNWDdCWHhsZkdrLWlscE5KLVRvVDlydC1rVTh5Q3VnRmxzRjdLY0ZVN3RRc0hNam00Tmhmd1pMUnA1VTVKSGNrVWZOMGlEeVdkRGNSRUxzaXRHNHRwT3Y1RVV1OXJtRXZLeVRYaVRfM1B5SDFabkhZdXlQYXFmY3N4VXotNVJwQlFxRGtyTW9GN1AwdTlaYVVB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3CLG25UBSJGZ3AZPWBLK3NMNKE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Cardiovascular disease remains&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the leading cause of death in the United States and accounted for 941,652 deaths in 2022, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/-/media/PHD-Files-2/Science-News/2/2025-Heart-and-Stroke-Stat-Update/2025-Statistics-At-A-Glance.pdf?sc_lang=en" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; published by the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NQNDS55LIZFYZI5YR4DG27QHZA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the United States in 2022, heart disease and stroke killed more people than all forms of cancer and accidental deaths.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you were at Osaka’s major international airport earlier this month, you’ll want to keep an eye on your physical condition for the next few weeks&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-692068"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On February 14, a resident of Aichi Prefecture began to feel hot. Unfortunately, this was not the result of romantic feelings swelling inside the woman because it was Valentine’s Day, but the onset of measles symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to a fever, the woman eventually developed a rash, cough, and intestinal inflammation, leading to a medical examination in which her &lt;strong&gt;measles infection was confirmed and announced by the Osaka Prefectural government on February 21&lt;/strong&gt;. The woman, who is in her 20s and had received measles vaccinations twice at some point in her life, is now hospitalized and undergoing recovery treatment, but what makes the situation still concerning is that &lt;strong&gt;prior to her diagnosis she appears to have traveled overseas via Kansai Airport, one of Japan’s largest international air hubs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&lt;strong&gt;n February 14, the woman took an airline-operated highway bus from Nagoya Staton in Aichi to Kansai Airport&lt;/strong&gt;, departing at around noon and arriving at approximately 3:30 p.m. She then spent the next two and a half hours inside the airport’s&lt;strong&gt; Terminal 1&lt;/strong&gt;, which is used for both domestic and international flights. The infection announcement states that the woman “had traveled to Vietnam” prior to her diagnosis, which would account for why &lt;strong&gt;she was back in Kansai Airport’s Terminal 1 a week later on February 21&lt;/strong&gt;, from about 4 to 6 in the evening. She then traveled to the &lt;strong&gt;Hatago Inn Kansai Airport&lt;/strong&gt;, a hotel in Izumisano City just across the water from the island which makes up the airport, where she stayed at the hotel from about 10:30 p.m. until noon the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;Osaka Prefecture’s second confirmed case of measles infection this year&lt;/strong&gt;, with the other, seemingly by coincidence, also announced on February 21. In an apparently unrelated case, a girl (whose age has been given as “under 10 years old”) was diagnosed with measles after developing a fever, cough, and rash. The child has no history of measles vaccination, and contact tracing efforts determined she was at the Lalaport Kadoma/Mitsui Outler Park Osaka Kadoma shopping center in Kadoma City on the evening of February 15 for roughly 40 minutes from about 5 p.m., and at the Hanaten branch of drugstore Matsumoto Kiyoshi in Osaka City on February 17 from approximately 6:10 to 6:50 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After infection, it can take as much as three weeks for measles symptoms to show&lt;/strong&gt;, so health officials are urging anyone who happened be travelling through Kansai Airport or staying or shopping at the other above-mentioned locations on the specified dates to pay close attention to their physical condition over the next few weeks and consult a doctor if they begin to feel feverish or develop a cough or rash.&lt;/p&gt;

Developed by Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.bps.org.uk/psychologist/rorschach-test-100" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;in 1921&lt;/a&gt;, the test involves showing a number of inkblots to subjects, then asking them to say what they see. The images are deliberately inscrutable and open to interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;For decades they were popular among psychologists as a way of understanding a person's psyche from the creatures, objects or scenes they perceive in the shapes. It relies upon a phenomenon known as pareidolia, which is a tendency to find meaningful interpretations in things where there is none. It is the same reason why people see faces or animals in cloud formations or on the surface of the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;You might see a butterfly in the image while someone else might see a skull. According to proponents of the test, both interpretations shed light on how you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"When a person interprets a Rorschach image, they unconsciously project elements of their psyche such as fears, desires, and cognitive biases," says Barbara Santini, a London-based psychologist, who uses the Rorschach test with her clients.

"Looking closely, I'd say it most resembles a single entity with wings outstretched – perhaps a bat or a moth, with its wings open symmetrically," the chatbot wrote. "The central area could be interpreted as the body, and the details on the sides evoke the texture or shape of wings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"I think that's just rehearsing what it knows of the specific test," says Coen Dekker, a Dutch software developer &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://coendekker.nl/media/pdf/Performing-the-Rorschach-test-with-a-neural-network-v3.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;who a decade ago asked&lt;/a&gt; a neural network, an early version of the technology underpinning AI chatbots today, to complete a Rorschach test.

It's similar to the way a musician who has never experienced heartbreak can still write a song that pulls at your heartstrings, simply by analysing how other similar songs like it are structured. Or as Santini, the psychologist puts it, "If an AI's response resembles a human's, it's not because it sees the same thing but it's because its training data mirrors our collective visual culture."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;What we get is a facsimile of reality – and of thought. "ChatGPT can accurately describe emotions without actually experiencing them," Ghosh says. That doesn't make AI useless when it comes to matters of the mind, however. "ChatGPT can understand emotions, describe them, and help others make sense of their feelings," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Ghosh believes that ChatGPT is simply regurgitating random information from its dataset for the benefit of users – which gives the impression of "thinking", but never actually is. Part of the reason why we perceive it possibly as thinking is the way that the tech companies behind these AI chatbots present their products. ChatGPT and tools like it are always helpful, always conscientious, and always conversational. The anthropomorphising of these tools has helped their adoption – but it can muddy the waters around how they – and their outputs – are perceived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp" alt='Estudio Santa Rita The images that an AI "sees" in an inkblot is merely a reflection of the data it has been trained upon (Credit: Estudio Santa Rita)' class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 fxQYxK"&gt;Estudio Santa Rita&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw"&gt;The images that an AI "sees" in an inkblot is merely a reflection of the data it has been trained upon (Credit: Estudio Santa Rita)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;One way of uncovering that unreality is by simply pressing the refresh button, says Ghosh.

They trained an AI algorithm called "&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/norman/overview/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;Norman&lt;/a&gt;" – named after Alfred Hitchcock's character Norman Bates – on images from a Reddit group that shares images of people dying in gruesome circumstances. When they showed Norman a set of Rorschach inkblots, the images it described seeing reflected the darkness it had been trained upon. While an algorithm trained on a more normal set of image data would see a group of birds on a tree branch, Norman &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44040008" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;described seeing a man being electrocuted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;It is a stark illustration of just how important the data used to train an AI can be.

"It has a general understanding of colour theory and what emotional responses these could give when analysed," says Dekker. "I have a feeling it has a general understanding of the images and what people associate it with. This got me thinking: Wouldn't it be cool if we had – or created – a new set of Rorschach-like images which the model does not know about at all, and let it analyse those?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;While this isn't something Dekker is actively pursuing, we know that AI algorithms do have a tendency to "hallucinate" and invent information that isn't true. But it is also possible force them to hallucinate too. In one experiment by computer scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, US, they were able to 3D print a turtle with a particular colour and texture that fooled &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/athalye18b.html" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;a machine vision system into thinking it was a rifle&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, a &lt;a target="_self" href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170410-how-to-fool-artificial-intelligence" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;few stickers on a stop sign&lt;/a&gt; can render it invisible to the algorithm – a potential risk for a self-driving car.

There was no subjectivity in what the AI system was saying when presented with the inkblots, Kubiliute says.

The show captures the exhaustion and desperation many cancer patients feel, and the seductive allure of ditching traditional medicine for the promise of a “natural” cure. It also exposes the dark underbelly of the alternative health industry — a world where quacks and influencers prey on the vulnerable. They speak with unwavering confidence, yet their claims are backed by zero peer-reviewed evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know this all too well ... because I almost fell for it myself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer in December 2022. I immediately began scheduling consultations with surgeons, but most appointments were pushed to mid- or late January because of the holidays. With weeks to wait, I decided to use the time proactively — or so I thought — and met with Dr. T, an integrative medical doctor, to explore if supplements could support my health while I waited for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Dr. T fully backed my decision to pursue surgery, she mentioned another holistic practitioner, Dr. D, who specialized in &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/breast-cancer/thermography" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="thermography" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b764e2e4b050f805a184b9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.healthline.com/health/breast-cancer/thermography" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;thermography&lt;/a&gt;. She explained that thermography — a thermal imaging technique that maps blood flow on the breast’s surface — potentially can identify areas of abnormal heat linked to inflammation or tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;What caught my attention, though, was her offhand remark that Dr. D had allegedly “healed” a breast cancer patient without surgery, radiation or chemotherapy. As a science writer curious about holistic medicine, I was intrigued. Could thermography detect my cancer? I decided to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author shortly before breast-conserving surgery at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I arrived at Dr. D’s office, I noticed that it felt more like a spa than a medical clinic — a welcome change from the windowless rooms with fluorescent lighting where I’d gotten my breast screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thermogram process involved nine thermal images taken with a special camera, followed by a “cold challenge” where I submerged my hands in icy water to test how my body responded. I was told that healthy tissue cools in sync with the brain’s signals, while cancerous or inflamed areas resist the change and show up as hot spots on the thermogram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was fascinated, but I couldn’t ignore the red flags: thermograms &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-issues-warning-letter-clinic-illegally-marketing-unapproved-thermography-device-warns-consumers" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="aren’t FDA approved " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b764e2e4b050f805a184b9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-issues-warning-letter-clinic-illegally-marketing-unapproved-thermography-device-warns-consumers" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;aren’t FDA approved &lt;/a&gt;as standalone tests for detecting breast cancer, and the technician operating the machine turned out to be the doctor’s wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;After waiting for 30 minutes for my results — an eternity that left me uneasy — Dr. D finally called me into his office. And then, things took a bizarre turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, he showed me the rainbow-colored thermogram report and acknowledged that it hadn’t detected my cancer — in fact, he seemed visibly flustered by the imaging fail. Instead, it had only revealed “extra heat” in the area, putting me in the “high-risk” category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, he revealed his theory: My cancer was caused by “too many COVID vaccines,” and I shouldn’t get another. I was too stunned to respond. Not only is there zero evidence linking COVID vaccines to breast cancer or other “&lt;a href="https://www.contagionlive.com/view/mrna-covid-19-vaccines-and-turbo-cancer-the-latest-myth-that-won-t-disappear" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="turbo cancers" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b764e2e4b050f805a184b9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.contagionlive.com/view/mrna-covid-19-vaccines-and-turbo-cancer-the-latest-myth-that-won-t-disappear" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;turbo cancers&lt;/a&gt;,” the claim flew in the face of my personal history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What about the fact that my mom had the same type of cancer, in the same breast, at the same age?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He dismissed this outright. “No, it’s definitely the vaccines,” he insisted, before pivoting to his next pitch: Super Mineral Water, a product he sold in his clinic, which he claimed could “detox” my body and possibly help cure me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;By then, I was equally horrified and embarrassed — not just by his quackery, but by my naiveté for walking into this mess. I grabbed my things and left as quickly as I could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author ringing a bell after finishing a month of radiation treatment at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;After my experience, I turned to the internet and stumbled on some comment boards about thermograms. One post led me to the story of &lt;a href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/wellness/story/breast-cancer-survivor-shares-cautionary-tale-relying-solely-60728490" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Morganne Delian" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b764e2e4b050f805a184b9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/wellness/story/breast-cancer-survivor-shares-cautionary-tale-relying-solely-60728490" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Morganne Delian&lt;/a&gt;, a believer in homeopathic medicine who opted for a thermogram instead of a mammogram to detect cancer when she felt a lump in her breast. The thermogram practitioner reportedly told Delian that he couldn’t see a lump but warned she had “mild to moderate risk of developing aggressive breast tissue.” Months later, after finally undergoing a mammogram and a biopsy, she was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stories like Delian’s are chilling reminders of the potential dangers posed by unproven screening tools and alternative therapies.

Part of it, I think, is the allure of control in a moment when you feel paralyzed with terror. A cancer diagnosis strips you of your agency — your body feels like a traitor and your treatment plan is dictated by a team of experts that you’ve just met. Alternative medicine offers the illusion of empowerment and personalized care. Quacks don’t bog you down with statistics, side effects or limitations — they offer hope and simplicity. In a world where cancer treatments are scary or difficult to understand, that simplicity and hope can become irresistible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;After my diagnosis, one of the best things I did was learn to trust my cancer team and the science that guided them. I abandoned my wishful thinking — the fantasy of the “lovely healing experience,” like Milla’s tropical Hirsch retreat in “Apple Cider Vinegar.” Instead, I embraced the stark reality of white hospital walls and a windowless operating room, where my surgeon skillfully removed my tumor and left me cancer free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author and her husband at the D.C.

The show captures the exhaustion and desperation many cancer patients feel, and the seductive allure of ditching traditional medicine for the promise of a “natural” cure. It also exposes the dark underbelly of the alternative health industry — a world where quacks and influencers prey on the vulnerable. They speak with unwavering confidence, yet their claims are backed by zero peer-reviewed evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know this all too well ... because I almost fell for it myself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer in December 2022. I immediately began scheduling consultations with surgeons, but most appointments were pushed to mid- or late January because of the holidays. With weeks to wait, I decided to use the time proactively — or so I thought — and met with Dr. T, an integrative medical doctor, to explore if supplements could support my health while I waited for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Dr. T fully backed my decision to pursue surgery, she mentioned another holistic practitioner, Dr. D, who specialized in &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/breast-cancer/thermography" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="thermography" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b764e2e4b050f805a184b9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.healthline.com/health/breast-cancer/thermography" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;thermography&lt;/a&gt;. She explained that thermography — a thermal imaging technique that maps blood flow on the breast’s surface — potentially can identify areas of abnormal heat linked to inflammation or tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;What caught my attention, though, was her offhand remark that Dr. D had allegedly “healed” a breast cancer patient without surgery, radiation or chemotherapy. As a science writer curious about holistic medicine, I was intrigued. Could thermography detect my cancer? I decided to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author shortly before breast-conserving surgery at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I arrived at Dr. D’s office, I noticed that it felt more like a spa than a medical clinic — a welcome change from the windowless rooms with fluorescent lighting where I’d gotten my breast screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thermogram process involved nine thermal images taken with a special camera, followed by a “cold challenge” where I submerged my hands in icy water to test how my body responded. I was told that healthy tissue cools in sync with the brain’s signals, while cancerous or inflamed areas resist the change and show up as hot spots on the thermogram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was fascinated, but I couldn’t ignore the red flags: thermograms &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-issues-warning-letter-clinic-illegally-marketing-unapproved-thermography-device-warns-consumers" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="aren’t FDA approved " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b764e2e4b050f805a184b9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-issues-warning-letter-clinic-illegally-marketing-unapproved-thermography-device-warns-consumers" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;aren’t FDA approved &lt;/a&gt;as standalone tests for detecting breast cancer, and the technician operating the machine turned out to be the doctor’s wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;After waiting for 30 minutes for my results — an eternity that left me uneasy — Dr. D finally called me into his office. And then, things took a bizarre turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, he showed me the rainbow-colored thermogram report and acknowledged that it hadn’t detected my cancer — in fact, he seemed visibly flustered by the imaging fail. Instead, it had only revealed “extra heat” in the area, putting me in the “high-risk” category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, he revealed his theory: My cancer was caused by “too many COVID vaccines,” and I shouldn’t get another. I was too stunned to respond. Not only is there zero evidence linking COVID vaccines to breast cancer or other “&lt;a href="https://www.contagionlive.com/view/mrna-covid-19-vaccines-and-turbo-cancer-the-latest-myth-that-won-t-disappear" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="turbo cancers" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b764e2e4b050f805a184b9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.contagionlive.com/view/mrna-covid-19-vaccines-and-turbo-cancer-the-latest-myth-that-won-t-disappear" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;turbo cancers&lt;/a&gt;,” the claim flew in the face of my personal history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What about the fact that my mom had the same type of cancer, in the same breast, at the same age?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He dismissed this outright. “No, it’s definitely the vaccines,” he insisted, before pivoting to his next pitch: Super Mineral Water, a product he sold in his clinic, which he claimed could “detox” my body and possibly help cure me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;By then, I was equally horrified and embarrassed — not just by his quackery, but by my naiveté for walking into this mess. I grabbed my things and left as quickly as I could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author ringing a bell after finishing a month of radiation treatment at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;After my experience, I turned to the internet and stumbled on some comment boards about thermograms. One post led me to the story of &lt;a href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/wellness/story/breast-cancer-survivor-shares-cautionary-tale-relying-solely-60728490" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Morganne Delian" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b764e2e4b050f805a184b9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/wellness/story/breast-cancer-survivor-shares-cautionary-tale-relying-solely-60728490" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Morganne Delian&lt;/a&gt;, a believer in homeopathic medicine who opted for a thermogram instead of a mammogram to detect cancer when she felt a lump in her breast. The thermogram practitioner reportedly told Delian that he couldn’t see a lump but warned she had “mild to moderate risk of developing aggressive breast tissue.” Months later, after finally undergoing a mammogram and a biopsy, she was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stories like Delian’s are chilling reminders of the potential dangers posed by unproven screening tools and alternative therapies.

Part of it, I think, is the allure of control in a moment when you feel paralyzed with terror. A cancer diagnosis strips you of your agency — your body feels like a traitor and your treatment plan is dictated by a team of experts that you’ve just met. Alternative medicine offers the illusion of empowerment and personalized care. Quacks don’t bog you down with statistics, side effects or limitations — they offer hope and simplicity. In a world where cancer treatments are scary or difficult to understand, that simplicity and hope can become irresistible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;After my diagnosis, one of the best things I did was learn to trust my cancer team and the science that guided them. I abandoned my wishful thinking — the fantasy of the “lovely healing experience,” like Milla’s tropical Hirsch retreat in “Apple Cider Vinegar.” Instead, I embraced the stark reality of white hospital walls and a windowless operating room, where my surgeon skillfully removed my tumor and left me cancer free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author and her husband at the D.C.

            &lt;p&gt;February is American Heart Month, the perfect time to take a closer look at your heart health. Let’s start with the bad news: Yes, your risk of developing heart disease increases with age. After 50, your blood vessels start stiffening, your heart wall gets thicker and inflammation sets in, setting you up for a possible cardiovascular event. ﻿&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            
&lt;p&gt;But we’re not telling you this to send you into a spiral of despair. Heart disease is serious and scary — but not unavoidable. There have been some &lt;a href="/benefits-discounts/members-only-access/info-2024/heart-health-technology-breakthroughs.html" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/moa-content/2025/02/heart-health-secrets.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP.

A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="exercises to live longer"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;. But if you really want to outsmart heart disease, you’ve got to be one step ahead of it. That means getting insider tips from a person whose entire job is to ensure our hearts keep working as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Martha Gulati, MD, the Director of Preventive Cardiology at Cedars‑Sinai's Smidt Heart Institute, and the author of &lt;i&gt;Saving Women’s Hearts&lt;/i&gt; shares 1﻿4 steps everyone over 50 can take for a stronger, healthier, more resilient heart.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don’t treat your cardiologist like a traffic cop&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



            
        
            
&lt;p&gt;Patients think they know what we doctors want to hear. If I ask them about the negative things, like how much alcohol they drink or &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/info-2024/smoking-and-high-blood-pressure.html" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/moa-content/2025/02/heart-health-secrets.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="lower blood pressure"&gt;whether they smoke&lt;/a&gt;, they always underestimate it. And they overestimate how much exercise they’re doing. But cardiologists and patients need to work together like partners, not adversaries. You shouldn’t talk to us like you’re trying to talk your way out of a speeding ticket. We’re on your side. We’re your partner in this journey. And we can only help if we really know what’s going on. You should think of your doctor’s office as a safe space. And if for any reason you don't feel that way, then find a new doctor.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep track of any chest discomfort or shortness of breath&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;I see both men and women downplaying their symptoms as if they almost don’t want to bother their doctor with them. They’ll say, “I get this chest discomfort, but it’s probably nothing.” And they minimize it. But actually, we really need to hear about those symptoms honestly. We want to hear exactly what you’re feeling. We need to know the real facts of when and how those symptoms appear. Then, we’ll go through it with you and determine whether it’s related to your heart. In addition to chest discomfort, you should always talk with your provider if you experience shortness of breath while doing an activity you formerly could do without any problem.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Find a reason to laugh every day&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;A few studies of older adults have demonstrated how laughter can be an effective way to keep your heart healthy. Specifically, these studies looked at the artery function and found a benefit from a coronary artery standpoint. We’re not sure exactly what’s happening, but we know that endorphins get released when you laugh, which can actually latch onto receptors in the blood vessels, which may be one of the reasons why we see benefits in the artery function. Once they attach, the arteries themselves may be better able to release nitric oxide, which relaxes the arteries and improves blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Have more (worry-free) sex!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;There’s that old Hollywood cliche where an older man sleeps with a younger woman and has a heart attack. Somehow that’s evolved into anxiety that all older adults having sex could end up with heart failure. Sex does increase our heart rate and blood pressure, but don’t overestimate it as a physical activity. You probably exert more energy with a brisk walk. (Of course, ﻿if you’re doing something &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;athletic and interesting, that might be a different story﻿!﻿) But regular intercourse is fine. If you start having chest pain during sex, or you’re feeling a shortness of breath, that’s something you should talk to your doctor about. But otherwise, sex has been found to reduce the risk of heart disease, not encourage it.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;You don’t need to drink alcohol to reduce stress — you need a dog&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;For years now, we’ve been telling people that &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/info-2025/age-and-alcohol.html" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/moa-content/2025/02/heart-health-secrets.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="age and alcohol"&gt;there’s no real amount of alcohol&lt;/a&gt; that we recommend, from a heart health perspective. If you don’t drink, don’t start. If you do drink, then drink moderately. The recommendation for men is two or fewer drinks per day. For women, it’s one glass of wine or the equivalent daily.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            
&lt;p&gt;But an even better recommendation is not to drink at all, and find a healthier way to deal with your stress. &lt;a href="/benefits-discounts/members-only-access/info-2024/smart-guide-pet-adoption.html" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/moa-content/2025/02/heart-health-secrets.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="guide to pet adoption"&gt;So consider getting a dog&lt;/a&gt;. There’s some evidence that owning a dog can reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke by over 30 percent. Dogs can reduce stress, anxiety and depression. And nobody has ever gotten a hangover from living with a dog.&lt;/p&gt;
            
        &lt;/div&gt;

If that remained true, the virus would not change much to become more dangerous soon, and any vaccine could provide &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/30/science/coronavirus-mutations.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:years of durable protection;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;years of durable protection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What actually happened was that SARS-CoV-2 began mutating quickly, first to be &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/12/virus-mutation-catastrophe/617531/?utm_source=yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:more transmissible;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;more transmissible&lt;/a&gt; and then to evade our immunity, causing breakthrough infections and reinfections. Five years and &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/04/covid-variant-naming-omicron-ba2/629558/?utm_source=yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:an alphanumeric soup of variants;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;an alphanumeric soup of variants&lt;/a&gt; later, most of us have gotten COVID at least once. The vaccine is still being updated to match new circulating variants. And the virus itself is still changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In truth, scientists were both right and wrong about the speed at which SARS-CoV-2 mutates. The rate of mutations as this virus jumps from person to person is indeed unimpressive. But scientists were not aware of a second, accelerated evolutionary track: When SARS-CoV-2 infects a single immunocompromised patient, it can persist for months, accumulating countless mutations in that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And if we are unlucky, that highly mutated virus might spread to others. This is the likely origin of Omicron, which appeared in fall 2021 with more than &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/01/coronavirus-variant-after-omicro/621404/?utm_source=yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:50 mutations;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;50 mutations&lt;/a&gt;—an astounding evolutionary leap. Omicron looked like it had achieved four or five years’ worth of expected evolution in just months, Jesse Bloom, who studies viral evolution at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/12/omicron-spread-infection-severity/620948/?utm_source=yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:told me at the time;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;told me at the time&lt;/a&gt;. These mutations enabled Omicron to cause a massive wave of infections even among the vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Scientists now believe that chronic infections in immunocompromised patients are a key driver of variants in Omicron and beyond. Even as COVID surveillance has faded in urgency, researchers are watching chronic infections for signs of what’s to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="my-4"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In retrospect, clues were there from the beginning. At the start of the pandemic, researchers in New York, including Harm van Bakel, a geneticist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, began sequencing viruses from &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2031670" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cancer patients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;cancer patients&lt;/a&gt; who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in March and April 2020—and then kept testing positive for up to two months. The patients couldn’t clear the virus because their immune systems had been weakened by disease and by cancer treatments they received. The study, published in December 2020, concluded that immunocompromised patients with COVID might need long isolation periods, lest they unwittingly spread the virus. (These chronic infections in people who are immunocompromised are distinct from long COVID, which doesn’t necessarily involve continual shedding of virus.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That same month, a &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.05.20241927v3.full.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:preprint;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt; from a group led by Ravindra Gupta in the U.K. connected more of the dots. Gupta and his colleagues had found an immunocompromised patient with a lingering infection who was treated with &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/03/plasma-blood-covid-19-survivors/609007/?utm_source=yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:antibodies from COVID survivors;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;antibodies from COVID survivors&lt;/a&gt;, only for the virus to acquire curious new mutations. Two mutations in particular gave the virus a slight edge in infectivity and antibody evasion. An immunocompromised host, the authors suggested, could provide the ideal viral training ground: A weakened immune system cannot wipe out the virus but can put up just enough defense for the virus to learn its tricks. In this case, the infused antibodies from COVID survivors likely contributed to whatever defenses the patient himself had, but even together they were not enough to completely clear the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The virus from that particular patient probably didn’t spread far, if at all; most do not. But countless chronic infections all around the world subjecting the virus to similar immune defenses could ultimately lead to the same battle-tested mutations showing up over and over again. Indeed, mutations similar to the two in the U.K. patient soon showed up in variants such as Alpha and Omicron that did sweep around the world, Gupta told me recently. And in 2021, multiple alarming variants were found to have a different mutation that researchers in New York first observed in immunocompromised patients way back at the beginning of the pandemic. (Researchers at Mount Sinai, led by van Bakel and Viviana Simon, did match a minor variant from an immunocompromised patient &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10239218/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:to other infections in the New York City area;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;to other infections in the New York City area&lt;/a&gt;, though it didn’t seem to spread much beyond that.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;None of the more notorious COVID variants has been directly traced to a single immunocompromised patient. But indirect evidence has accumulated over time that many variants do develop this way. Chronic infections, scientists have now observed over and over, create a distinct pattern of mutations: an overabundance of changes in the spike protein (which helps penetrate human cells) but not in the rest of the virus. This pattern is clearly found in both &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/04/ba2-omicron-variant-covid-surge/629474/?utm_source=yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:BA.1 and BA.2 versions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;BA.1 and BA.2 versions&lt;/a&gt; of Omicron, as well as the variant that gave rise to JN.1, which drove last winter’s COVID surge. Bloom now says he has “very high confidence” that these variants came from chronic infections. The evidence is not as clear with other variants, he told me, but they could very well have evolved in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Long before COVID, Bloom had tracked the &lt;a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/26875.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:evolution of influenza;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;evolution of influenza&lt;/a&gt; during chronic infections in four immunocompromised patients; some mutations in these patients eventually showed up in the seasonal flu. I &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/06/evolution-of-the-flu/531693/?utm_source=yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:wrote about;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;wrote about&lt;/a&gt; the study when it was published in 2017, intrigued by the possibility that chronic infections could predict changes in flu from year to year. At the time, this was quite a novel idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Flu and COVID evolution do differ in important ways, but chronic COVID infections, too, are now being examined as harbingers of the future. “Those will actually teach us a lot about the future tricks SARS-CoV-2 will come up with,” says Simon, a microbiologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. To discover what those might be, she and van Bakel are now leading a &lt;a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/bwoQvHcXK0S4oZ3fGE8iWQ/project-details/10889260#description" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research project;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;research project&lt;/a&gt; to create better tools for sequencing chronic infections and to better understand which immunocompromised patients are most at risk for carrying them. What they find could be a preview for the future of COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/02/covid-virus-evolution/681798/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Article originally published at The Atlantic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Article originally published at &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxONVJLdWt4aEEwUXdUdVVrdTVxVFBkalk5TVlsdnNUc2dGeUJUZV8zdURaVWRSVGpoSk96SmExNTc4aDU2b2YwdUx0X0Iwd3YyZmNiRmRheXJHMGYyYzEtUHpZZFdSM3RPT2otTm92Nk0wQzVQZkRBOWxBMnhyRkZwdA</guid></item></channel></rss>
