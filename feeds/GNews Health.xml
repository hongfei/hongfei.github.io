                Injectable GLP-1 drugs have been a game-changer for many people with obesity. But as researchers discover why the medicines fail for others, they are gaining insights about the complexity of the condition.

    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Obesity shaped Anna Olson's earliest notions of herself, when she saw a photo and thought, "Oh, I look different than the other kids."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Olson's obesity began in toddlerhood, ran in her family, and left her with a chronic hunger hard to satiate. Dozens of diet, drug and exercise regimens didn't work, and advice from doctors was always the same: Eat less. "And I'm kind of like, 'Well, it's what I'm doing now. What else can I do?'" she says, and the response, again, was: "Well, you just got to eat less."&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In fact, science now shows obesity is far more complex — with numerous genetic, biological, neurological, lifestyle, metabolic and behavioral factors contributing to it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Root causes vary&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Doctors, patients and drug companies have learned a lot more in recent years about obesity and what works — or doesn't — since the new class of obesity treatments known as GLP-1 drugs have come to market. Although obesity manifests one way — excess weight — doctors say there are perhaps dozens of different forms of it. For treatment to work, therefore, root causes must be identified, then addressed, for each person. Obesity doctors and researchers say within several years, they expect treatment will be more customized to meet the needs of each patient.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For Olson, genetic testing indicated she likely has several genetic and hormonal factors setting her hunger and satiety sensors out of whack. One of the GLP-1 drugs — Ozempic — worked briefly, but it turned out another, Zepbound, better recalibrated Olson's hormone imbalance. It was only when she started tackling her specific obesity drivers&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that Olson began losing lots of weight — 65 pounds to date, as she remains on the medicine. "I've been able to keep it off," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Popular drugs a precursor to precision medicine?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Use of GLP-1 drugs is already huge and is set to become even more common, as the medicines become cheaper, with more variations, including the recently launched&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;easier-to-use Wegovy pill from Novo Nordisk.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Ozempic and Wegovy are the brand names for a drug called semaglutide. Zepbound and Mounjaro are the brands of a drug called tirzepatide. Both are &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/medical-answers/tirzepatide-semaglutide-how-compare-3576410/" target="_blank"&gt;GLP-1 agonists, and tirzepatide blocks&lt;/a&gt; an additional hormone, known as GIP.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Within a few years, doctors say, there also will be more ways to determine an individual's specific obesity factors, which will enable a more precise targeting of the root causes of their obesity, similar to how chemotherapies can target specific cancer subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The complex makeup of obesity might also explain why GLP-1s don't work for many people. A sizable minority &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/glp-1-diabetes-and-weight-loss-drug-side-effects-ozempic-face-and-more" target="_blank"&gt;experience side effects&lt;/a&gt; like nausea; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11751938/" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown a significant portion of patients lose less than 5% of their body weight on the drug, though they may experience other metabolic improvements.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Obesity subtypes &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There are many types of obesity, and each type of obesity has a unique genetic predisposition," says &lt;a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/acosta-andres-j-m-d-ph-d/bio-20189108" target="_blank"&gt;Andres Acosta&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist and hepatologist at the Mayo Clinic. Acosta says early research indicates genetic markers might be measured to predict, for example, whether a person might not respond well to GLP-1 medicines.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Acosta is also co-founder of Phenomix Sciences, a company selling genetic testing through some doctors' offices; the testing is &lt;a href="https://www.myphenometest.com/faqs" target="_blank"&gt;not covered by insurance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The cheek-swab genetic test groups people into four basic obesity &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Phenotype" target="_blank"&gt;phenotypes&lt;/a&gt; (meaning observable traits): Hungry Gut, Hungry Brain, Emotional Hunger, and Slow Burn. (A person might belong to more than one of these groups.) Each category has different hormonal or lifestyle factors that drive obesity. For example, someone with emotionally driven eating habits might not benefit as much from GLP-1 drugs.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Acosta says also, those with abnormalities in their gut hormones tend to lose more weight on GLP-1 medicines, while some people with "Hungry Brain" genetic markers may have a broken neural pathway that prevents the drug from being as effective for that group. For those people, Acosta says, often earlier generations of weight-loss medicines — or a combination of new and old drugs — work best.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A workable treatment plan&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Anna Olson says this kind of personalization was key. Through genetic testing, she found out her phenotype is "Hungry Brain." She also found out she has &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bardet-biedl-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20586227#:~:text=Overview,%2C%20learning%2C%20thinking%20and%20memory." target="_blank"&gt;Bardet-Biedl syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, a genetic disorder that predisposes her to eat too much. Knowing that, she says, reduced her sense of stigma and helped her find the most fitting combination of medications for her.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now 36, she says her cholesterol and blood sugar levels have improved, and she's closer to her dream of traveling further afield from her native Minneapolis. "When I was more overweight than now, there was absolutely no way that I could do that."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More precise diagnosis of specific forms of obesity is still a few years off, says &lt;a href="https://obesitymedicine.org/resources/speakers-bureau/lydia-alexander-md-foma/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Lydia Alexander&lt;/a&gt;, past president of the &lt;a href="https://obesitymedicine.org/?utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_campaign=TM_BR_SummerDiscountExtension25" target="_blank"&gt;Obesity Medicine Association&lt;/a&gt;. But researchers are getting closer to understanding the variables that make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The chemistry of a person's gut microbiome, their proclivity toward addiction, or the molecular shape of their hormone receptors can all affect the drug's efficacy, she says. "The medication might be degraded faster in one individual than in another," she says, which might also explain the different responses to GLP-1s.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Alexander says that in all instances, adaptations in lifestyle are critical for a full and lasting response. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/392/bmj-2025-085304" target="_blank"&gt;a recent review of 37 studies on weight loss&lt;/a&gt; showed that those who rely on GLP-1 drugs tend to gain back the weight at a faster rate when they stop treatment, as compared to those who rely on behavioral change.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A 50-50 chance of success&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, one of the downsides of &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/poll-1-in-8-adults-say-they-are-currently-taking-a-glp-1-drug-for-weight-loss-diabetes-or-another-condition-even-as-half-say-the-drugs-are-difficult-to-afford/" target="_blank"&gt;popularized GLP-1 drugs&lt;/a&gt; is that they have raised people's expectations for rapid weight loss, says &lt;a href="https://popcenter.harvard.edu/blog/directory/jennifer-manne-goehler/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jennifer Manne-Goehler&lt;/a&gt;, a Harvard metabolic disease specialist. She says &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11404059/#:~:text=3.1.,-2.&amp;amp;text=Similarly%2C%20a%20greater%20proportion%20of,14%2C23%2C24%5D." target="_blank"&gt;roughly half of those who take GLP-1 drugs lose 15%&lt;/a&gt; or more of their weight, and "because the potential of those drugs is so incredible for that half, everyone who takes them thinks they're going to be in the half that have that experience."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Manne-Goehler says what's often forgotten is that obesity is a chronic, lifelong condition. "One tool does not work for each person, and one tool often is not enough over the lifetime of a person to control or to mitigate the health impact of that condition," she says. But over the next few years, she says, at least there will be more tools to better target treatment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Possible risk of autism in children. Dormant cancer cells awakening. Accelerating aging of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal officials in May 2023 &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ashish-jha-on-winding-down-the-covid-19-pandemic-emergency/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;declared an end&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/end-of-phe.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;national COVID pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. But more than two years later, a growing body of research continues to reveal information about the virus and its ability to cause harm long after initial infections resolve, even in some cases when symptoms were mild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discoveries raise fresh concerns about the Trump administration's COVID policies, researchers say. While some studies show COVID vaccines offer protective benefits against longer-term health effects, the Department of Health and Human Services has drastically limited recommendations about who should get the shot. The administration also &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/slashing-of-funding-for-mrna-vaccine-development-raises-concern/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;halted Biden-era contracts&lt;/a&gt; aimed at developing more protective COVID vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal government is curtailing such efforts just as researchers call for more funding and, in some cases, long-term monitoring of people previously infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People forget, but the legacy of COVID is going to be long, and we are going to be learning about the chronic effects of the virus for some time to come," said &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/michael-t-osterholdm-phd-mph" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Michael Osterholm&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist who directs the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration said that the COVID vaccine &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-acip-vaccine-recommendations-covid-chickenpox/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;remains available&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and that individuals are encouraged to talk with their health providers about what is best for them. The COVID vaccine and others on the schedule of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention remain covered by insurance so that individuals don't need to pay out-of-pocket, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Updating CDC guidance and expanding shared clinical decision-making restores informed consent, centers parents and clinicians, and discourages 'one size fits all' policies," said HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although COVID has become less deadly, because of population immunization and mutations making the virus less severe, researchers say the politicization around the infection is obscuring what science is increasingly confirming: COVID's potential to cause unexpected, possibly chronic health issues. That in turn, these scientists say, drives the need for more, rather than less, research, because over the long term, COVID could have significant economic and societal implications, such as higher health care costs and more demands on social programs and caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual average burden of the disease's long-term health effects is estimated at $1 trillion globally and $9,000 per patient in the U.S., according to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12639003/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;report published&lt;/a&gt; in November in the journal NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine. In this country, the annual lost earnings are estimated to be about $170 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One study estimates that the flu resulted in $16 billion in direct health costs and $13 billion in productivity losses in the 2023-2024 season, according to &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.64898/2025.12.23.25342685v1.full" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;a Dec. 30 report in MedRxiv&lt;/a&gt;, an online platform that publishes work not yet certified by peer review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;COVID's growing reach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much has been learned about COVID since the virus emerged in 2019, unleashing a pandemic that the World Health Organization reports has killed more than &lt;a href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/deaths" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;7 million people&lt;/a&gt;. By the spring of 2020, the term "&lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/long-covid-what-scientists-now-know/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;long COVID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" had been coined to describe &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/long-covid-symptoms-nih-study/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;chronic health problems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that can persist post-infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recent studies show that infection by the virus that causes COVID, SARS-CoV-2, can result in heightened health risks months to more than a year later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, researchers following children born to mothers who contracted the virus while pregnant have discovered they may have an &lt;a href="https://secure-web.cisco.com/1NW5qPcwDHtYq61Mh4p5FWNgu1mmUrB2QAYq-vhqRRNn-7MGYPEsQpWsbC0267LhmpL11F1aSkZrWcUmZ05pN4ixHjN9V7uCeRRNTszAPHxW6026yC8Apd5C3NcumnwuMjt8W_6ivt2HY9z_a0pLasE3RVGL3i8kehntfPZEP7n34rKa8JVf9Fo7dKuuL1ROHaJ3fIW-Lbg_3ps-fWTr2Gtetq2155Fy_pRZHQjBpUN9H-CusODm3NUIpY8m9j4SRJ0AO1gOAet9cDKSnF1cTloVo7F-crOKu5jKZQn9FAhwCneHu2Ersf297fC9ogaoiUwLZDd8u-40CyqUNTG_hLA/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cidrap.umn.edu%2Fcovid-19%2Fkids-exposed-covid-utero-may-be-higher-risk-autism-other-brain-problems" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;increased risk for autism&lt;/a&gt;, delayed speech and motor development, or other neurodevelopmental challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38351665/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; found babies exposed to COVID in utero experienced accelerated weight gain in their first year, a possible harbinger of metabolic issues that could later carry an increased risk for cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These studies suggest avoiding severe COVID in pregnancy may reduce risk not just during pregnancy but for future generations. That may be another good reason to get vaccinated when pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are other body symptoms apart from the developing fetal brain that also may be impacted," said Andrea Edlow, an associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology at Harvard Medical School who was involved in both studies. "We definitely need more research."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epidemiologists point to some specific, emerging challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2311330" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;U.K. study&lt;/a&gt; in the New England Journal of Medicine found people who &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/even-fully-recovered-survivors-mild-covid-can-lose-iq-points-study-suggests#:~:text=Mild%20cognitive%20decline%20was%20noted,recovered%20from%20mild%20COVID%2D19." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;fully recovered&lt;/a&gt; from mild COVID infections experienced a cognitive deficit equal to a three-point drop in IQ. Among the more than 100,000 participants, deficits were greater in people who had persistent symptoms and reached the equivalent of a nine-point IQ drop for individuals admitted to intensive care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.va.gov/132887/dr-ziyad-al-aly-recognition-long-covid-research/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Ziyad Al-Aly&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical epidemiologist who has studied longer-term health effects from COVID, did the math. He estimated COVID may have increased the number of adults in the U.S. with an IQ of less than 70 from 4.7 million to 7.5 million — &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/covid-19-leaves-its-mark-on-the-brain-significant-drops-in-iq-scores-are/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;a jump of 2.8 million adults&lt;/a&gt; dealing with "a level of cognitive impairment that requires significant societal support," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People get COVID-19, some people do fine and bounce back, but there are people who start experiencing problems with memory, cognition, and fuzzy brain," he said. "Even people with mild symptoms. They might not even be aware."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diane Yormark, 67, of Boca Raton, Florida, can relate. She got COVID in 2022 and 2023. The second infection left her with brain fog and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I felt like if you had a little bit too much wine the night before and you're out of it," said Yormark, a retired copywriter, who said the worst of her symptoms lasted for about three months after the infection. "Some of the fog has lifted. But do I feel like myself? Not like I was."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from more than a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9978692/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;dozen studies&lt;/a&gt; suggests COVID vaccines can help reduce risk of severe infection as well as longer-lasting health effects, although researchers say more study is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc5" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",5]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But vaccination rates remain low in the U.S., with only about 17% of the adult population reporting that they got the updated 2025-2026 shot as of Jan. 16, based on &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/vaccination-trends.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;CDC data.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump administration officials led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have reduced access to COVID vaccines despite the lack of any new, substantiated evidence of harm. Though the shots were a hallmark achievement of the first Trump administration, which led the effort for their development, Kennedy has said without evidence that they are "&lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/dec/10/robert-f-kennedy-jr/no-covid-19-vaccine-not-deadliest-vaccine-ever-mad/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;the deadliest vaccine ever made&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May he said on X that the CDC would &lt;a href="https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1927368440811008138?s=46" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;stop recommending COVID shots &lt;/a&gt;for &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/27/nx-s1-5413179/covid-vaccine-children-pregnant-rfk-cdc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;healthy children and pregnant women&lt;/a&gt;, citing a &lt;a href="https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/rfk-jr-makes-false-claims-about-covid-deaths-vaccine-safety-senate-hearing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;lack of clinical data&lt;/a&gt;. The Food and Drug Administration has since issued new guidelines limiting the vaccine to people 65 or older and individuals 6 months or older with at least one risk factor, though many states continue to make them more widely available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration also halted &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/blog/mrna-vaccines-cuts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;almost $500 million in funding&lt;/a&gt; for mRNA-based vaccines. Administration officials and a number of Republicans question the safety of the Nobel Prize-winning technology — heralded for the potential to treat many diseases beyond COVID — even though clinical trials with tens of thousands of volunteers were performed before the &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/mrna-vaccines-trump-boast-under-gop-attacks-legislation/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;COVID mRNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt; were made available to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And numerous studies, including new research in 2025, show COVID vaccine benefits include a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2510226" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;reduction in the severity of disease&lt;/a&gt;, although the protective effects wane over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Following the findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers say more and broader support is important because much remains unknown about COVID and its impact on the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growing awareness that, even in mild COVID cases, the possibility exists for longer-term, often undetected &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11834749/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;organ damage&lt;/a&gt; also warrants more examination, researchers say. A &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352396425005560" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;study published this month&lt;/a&gt; in eBioMedicine found people with neurocognitive issues such as changes in smell or headaches after infection had significant levels of a protein linked to Alzheimer's in their blood plasma. EBioMedicine is a peer-reviewed, open-access journal published by &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the brain, the virus leads to an immune response that triggers inflammation, can damage brain cells, and can even shrink brain volume, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04569-5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;research on imaging studies&lt;/a&gt; that was published in March 2022 in the journal Nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666354625002005" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Australian study&lt;/a&gt; of advanced brain images found significant alterations even among people who had already recovered from mild infections — a possible explanation for &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251215/COVID-19-could-leave-a-measurable-imprint-on-the-brain.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;cognitive deficits&lt;/a&gt; that may persist for years. Lead study author Kiran Thapaliya said the research suggests the virus "may leave a silent, lasting effect on brain health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Al-Alay agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't know what will happen to people 10 years down the road," he said. "Inflammation of the brain is not a good thing. It's absolutely not a good thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That inflammatory response has also been linked to blood clots, arrhythmias, and higher risk of cardiovascular issues, even following a mild infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A University of Southern California study published in October 2024 in the journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology found the risk for a &lt;a href="https:/www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/ATVBAHA.124.321001" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;major cardiac event&lt;/a&gt; remains elevated nearly three years after COVID infection. The findings held even for people who were not hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were surprised to see the effects that far out" regardless of individual heart disease history, said James R. Hilser, the study's lead author and a postdoctoral fellow at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID can also &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09332-0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;reactivate cancer cells&lt;/a&gt; and trigger a relapse, according to research published in July in the journal Nature. Researchers found that the chance of dying from cancer among cancer survivors was higher among people who'd had COVID, especially in the year after being infected. There was nearly a twofold increase in cancer mortality in those who tested positive compared with those who tested negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential of the COVID virus to affect future generations is yielding new findings as well. Australian researchers looked at male mice and found that those who had been &lt;a href="https://florey.edu.au/news/2025/10/covid-19-causes-changes-in-sperm-that-lead-to-increased-anxiety-in-offspring/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;infected with and then recovered&lt;/a&gt; from COVID experienced changes to their sperm that altered their offspring's behavior, causing them to exhibit more anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, many people are now living — and struggling — with the virus' after-effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dee Farrand, 57, of Marana, Arizona, could once run five miles and was excelling at her job in sales. She recovered from a COVID infection in May 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months later, her heart began to beat irregularly. Farrand underwent a battery of tests at a hospital. Ultimately, the condition became so severe she had to go on supplemental oxygen for two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her cognitive abilities declined so severely she couldn't read, because she'd forget the first sentence after reading the second. She also had to leave herself reminders that she is allergic to shrimp or that she likes avocados. She said she lost her job and returned to her previous occupation as a social worker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was the person who is like the Energizer bunny and all of a sudden I'd get so tired getting dressed that I had to go back to bed," Farrand said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While she is better, COVID has left a mark. She said she's not yet able to run the five miles she used to do without any problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels.

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 345 to 419 calories while the lunches span 334 to 478 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;What are the health impacts of high blood sugar levels?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If left untreated, continuously elevated blood sugars can cause some serious harm. High blood sugar levels can damage blood vessels, which can reduce kidney function, cause vision loss, cause heart disease and negatively impact nearly every function in the body.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_182-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If improving blood sugars is your goal, research indicates that eating more protein may help. Protein is a nutrient with many health benefits, including supporting healthy blood sugar by slowing down digestion to mitigate blood sugar spikes. Eating a high-protein diet and reducing total carbohydrate can help reduce the risk, but it’s just one piece of this important puzzle. But, there’s no need to completely avoid carbs. Instead, opt to include &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-fiber-carbs-to-eat-according-to-a-dietitian-8364239" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-fiber carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt;, like legumes, fruit and whole grains, while limiting refined grains and added sugars. The fiber in carbohydrates isn’t digested, which means it slows down digestion and, like protein, helps reduce blood sugar spikes. Plus, fiber has many &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt; that you would miss out on if carbs were reduced drastically.

The plan was simple: a warm bath, a few peaceful minutes, and no one needing anything. But Winnie’s mom, who shares their life over at @the.golden.girl.winnie, learned very quickly that this was not going to be a solo activity. When the video starts, we already see this &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; puppy dangling over the tub’s rim. She seems to think “sharing is caring” applies to bathwater, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Golden Retriever puppy jumps into bathtub while owner is in it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The video opens mid-chaos with Winnie deciding to join her mom for her bath time. Her mom films from within the tub as Winnie’s front paws begin to flail against the porcelain. She tries to pull herself in, essentially swimming through the air with her upper body. Eventually, she finds some traction and hauls her hind legs over the side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She looks incredibly proud of this athletic achievement. One viewer joked, “Mum go in bath…. me go in bath,” which seems to be precisely what’s going through her head. If you live with a Golden Retriever, you already know water is rarely considered off-limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Then the video cuts to this very soggy Golden Retriever puppy standing in one corner of the bathtub. She looks down at a red-and-blue toy floating nearby with curiosity. Her front paws rest on the rim, dripping a steady stream of water onto the bath mat below. There’s not a single ounce of remorse on her face as she stands there innocently. So much for mom’s “me time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The comment section is obsessed with her lack of boundaries. One person noted that moms never actually get alone time, only “quality time” with a beautiful puppy. Another fan captured the mood perfectly, imagining Winnie thinking, “I’ll just uh.. scooch on in here.” Closed doors tend to be taken as a personal insult when there’s a dog in the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/204252-golden-retriever-puppy-video-bath-tub-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Video: Golden Retriever Puppy Makes Plans of Her Own When Owner Hits the Tub;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Video: Golden Retriever Puppy Makes Plans of Her Own When Owner Hits the Tub&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 07:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxPY1d3RVZ6dDdQdHp2dVBtMVE3MjdUVFVEaHlhS1A1WjhjTEN2NnFWOEgyTjlZczItcEthejk3U2I4R0x2dlBYbUdKSVBrdko5ZWxsQ0VTaWo1dFhoRjhkRGJ4SHBwb2ZRNGNoaW93YUJ6RkUta3FjTGk5RzZDd0kxR2R4cWpMRGJhQmhqNk82aElQRk9k</guid></item><item><title>疾控中心疫苗咨询委员会主席质疑脊髓灰质炎疫苗建议- ABC新闻</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/Health/chair-cdcs-vaccine-advisory-committee-questions-polio-shot/story?id=129580522</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;The head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine advisory committee questioned whether broad recommendations are necessary for vaccines that protect against polio and other infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Kirk Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist who was appointed chair of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) by Health Secretary Robert F.

"Does it [need] to be mandated for you to go to kindergarten, that these kids have every one of these vaccines that are recommended? That should be individually based. That is what I do as a doctor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Milhoan made the comments while appearing on the podcast "&lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a-conversation-w-dr-kirk-milhoan-chair-of-acip-on/id1788335471?i=1000746190751" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;Why Should I Trust You?&lt;/a&gt;" hosted by ABC News medical contributor and investigative reporter Dr. Mark Abdelmalek, Tom Johnson and Brinda Adhikari.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Vaccines such as the polio and measles vaccines have been hailed by public health officials as immense successes, preventing serious disease and death among millions worldwide.

Every U.S. state requires children to be vaccinated against polio to attend public schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"As you look at polio, we need to not be afraid to consider that we are in a different time now than we were then," Milhoan said. "Our sanitation is different, our risk of disease is different, and so those all play into the evaluation of whether this is worthwhile of taking a risk for a vaccine or not."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He continued, "We have to take into account that, are we enjoying herd immunity right now, that it may look like it's better not to get a vaccine than to get a vaccine, but if we take away all the herd immunity, does that switch?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Milhoan's comments received criticism from large medical organizations, such as the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DT3ptLuEy31/" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;American Medical Association&lt;/a&gt;, and medical professionals, including Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the division of infectious diseases at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Offit described Milhoan's comments as "frightening," adding that the ACIP chair expressed several ideas that are "directly averse to the health of children in this country."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He also said that many of Milhoan's comments are incorrect, including statements about polio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Offit explained that although the incidence of measles and whooping cough partly decreased due to improved sanitation, the opposite was true with polio. In the case of polio, improved sanitation increased the age at which a child was first exposed to polio -- after antibodies passed down from the mother wore off -- which made them more susceptible to paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Offit said it seems to him that Milhoan doesn’t know that improved sanitation increased cases of severe polio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"A lot of people don't know, but what upsets me is that he's in a position …  where he should know it,” Offit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Milhoan also questioned the need for the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which is also &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; by the CDC for children and required by every U.S. state to attend public schools.

"Our ability to have pediatric hospitals, children's hospitals, pediatric ICUs, how we look at the whole gamut of how we can treat measles is different. So that's something that comes into play."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Offit said it's not true that doctors have gotten better at treating measles among children who are hospitalized. No treatments have been developed in the last six decades, after the first measles vaccine became available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We're no better at treating measles than we were 60 years ago," Offit said. "I mean, what do we have? We have oxygen, we have ventilation. We had that in the 1960s. And in terms of dehydration, we had intravenous fluids. Again, no difference."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Offit also said that since the measles vaccine was developed, the death rate hasn't changed.

"We've had three people die, two of whom were children, this past year, among, let's say, 2,100 people who had measles. That's the same mortality rate as we had before there was a measles vaccine. So, what's [Milhoan] talking about?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Co-host Dr. Mark Abdemalek pressed Milhoan during the podcast about the adverse risks of measles infection being worse than risks from the MMR vaccine and brought up the same one in three mortality figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"This is not current data," Milhoan replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Co-host Tom Johnson asked Milhoan about his philosophy on individual autonomy with the example of a parent who chooses not to get their child vaccinated against measles and that child subsequently infects a different immunocompromised child. Johnson asked Milhoan if there is a line to cross where individual autonomy infringes on another child's safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“I would say I agree, there are two different things at play here. We don’t take one over the other,” Milhoan said. “Let’s just flip that the other way around. What if the child gets a measles vaccine to protect your immunocompromised child and gets a negative consequence from that? Wasn’t that your child causing that child to be harmed?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;When asked directly whether vaccines are adequately studied for safety, Milhoan said they are not, arguing that research has focused primarily on efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He dismissed the surveillance and monitoring systems as "very poor," signaling deep skepticism about the current infrastructure used to detect and evaluate vaccine safety signals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Offit said the comment that concerned him the most was when Milhoan was told by one of the hosts that ACIP would probably be receiving reports, files and data on vaccines to review based on established science, to which Milhoan replied, "That's not science."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Science is what I observe," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;The MMR vaccine at the City of Lubbock Health Department in Lubbock, Texas, Feb. 27, 2025.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh YxlyB "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;Annie Rice/Reuters, FILE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In response to perceived attacks from news organizations following the podcast, the Independent Medical Alliance, a group that promoted unproven treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic, defended Milhoan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Dr. Milhoan is an accomplished pediatric cardiologist and former U.S. Air Force physician who believes the Constitution protects citizens from government intrusion into personal medical decisions," the statement read, in part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;"To be clear, Dr. Milhoan is not anti-vaccine. He does not deny the success of the polio or smallpox vaccines. He is not calling for bans, rollbacks, or mass refusals.

He died of congestive heart failure at the age of 89. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born March 12, 1936, in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/local/iowa/decorah" text-decoration="none" class="Box-sc-ucqo0b-0 Link-sc-1u14kdb-0 HtmlContent___StyledLink-sc-ngx07-0 kEMoTa dEdZYg hRYGv"&gt;Decorah, Iowa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Foege was the third of six children raised by William A. Foege, a Lutheran minister, and his wife Anne Erika. His family moved to Chewelah, Washington, during his youth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After earning a B.A. in biology from Pacific Lutheran University in 1957, he studied medicine at the University of Washington, receiving his M.D. in 1961. He later earned a Master of Public Health from Harvard University in 1965. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foege's work in public health began with field experience in the Epidemic Intelligence Service of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In the 1960s, while in Nigeria, he developed a "ring vaccination" or "surveillance-containment" strategy to control smallpox outbreaks by locating cases and vaccinating people in close contact with them. This method was instrumental in eventually eradicating smallpox worldwide. It is the only human disease to have been entirely eradicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He went on to serve as director of the CDC from 1977 to 1983, guiding the agency through a period of expanded global engagement and disease control efforts. Among his challenges as CDC head was the emerging AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s. He worked to coordinate a group of epidemiologists to research the disease and fought for federal funding to support that research. His frustration with the initially slow federal response to the AIDS crisis contributed to his 1983 retirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After leaving CDC leadership, he held key roles at The Carter Center and as a senior adviser to the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. He also joined the faculty of Emory University as a professor of international health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foege was widely recognized for his humanitarian impact on global health. Among his many accolades was the Presidential Medal of Freedom, awarded by President Barack Obama in 2012. He was honored by such universities as Harvard, Yale, and the University of Michigan, and he was given the CDC Foundation Hero Award in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colleagues and followers noted Foege's humility and focus on collaborative achievement. "Nothing is done by an individual," he once said, embodying a spirit of partnership that defined his approach to public health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foege's influence extended far beyond smallpox. He co-founded the Task Force for Global Health, which has worked in over 150 countries to expand immunizations and strengthen health systems. He also championed efforts to combat polio, river blindness, and measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is survived by his wife, Paula (Ristad) Foege; two sons, Robert and Michael; three sisters; four grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. He was predeceased by his son David.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By Legacy News Staff&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Image: James Gathany of the CDC via Wikimedia Commons)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Legacy | Obituary</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 03:32:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxOZnlzNHVWV01jZFhLYkZSbHNrZkZzMk9aRHBHR2Y1RjVudG5rTG5NSFBGSmluOS0tUWdVQjloZ0ZFTmhjN3YwQjJ6a0FudDRXd3VLOWR0Vi04YW0tc2l5YnNaNW1wbnRPY1ZFR1JfUllyQ2lxZzBiVEpWVTVOWEg4ZVVOeXFvSmxpTVRycXVCOG4</guid></item><item><title>美国儿科学会发布与CDC不同的儿童疫苗建议- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/american-academy-of-pediatrics-vaccine-recommendations/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics released its recommendations for childhood vaccines on Monday, breaking significantly with the guidance released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-announces-new-childhood-vaccine-recommendations/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AAP is recommending &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2025/american-academy-of-pediatric-issues-recommended-childhood-and-adolescent-immunization-schedule-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;immunization against 18 diseases&lt;/a&gt;, including RSV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rotavirus, influenza and meningococcal disease. The CDC had reduced its recommendations for childhood vaccines to 11 diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The AAP will continue to provide recommendations for immunizations that are rooted in science and are in the best interest of the health of infants, children and adolescents of this country," AAP President Andrew Racine said in a statement Monday.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Amanda Kravitz, a pediatrician at New York's Weill Cornell Medicine, told "CBS Evening News" anchor Tony Dokoupil the AAP is "still recommending all of the vaccines that we have been recommending for many, many years." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So, there are no changes to the old vaccine schedule based on what the AAP is currently recommending," Kravitz said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    &lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the AAP and CDC recommend vaccinating children against diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, human papillomavirus (HPV) and varicella (chickenpox). (Some vaccines, such as the MMR shot for measles, mumps and rubella, protect against multiple diseases.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC recommended that only children in high-risk categories receive immunizations for RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, dengue, meningococcal ACWY and meningococcal B. The AAP still recommends all of these, except for the dengue vaccine, which it only recommends for some children who are 9 to 16 years old, live in areas where the disease is endemic and have previously been infected. It also noted distribution of the dengue vaccine was discontinued in the U.S. last year due to low demand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC had also said parents of children not in high-risk groups who want to vaccinate against COVID-19, influenza, meningococcal disease, hepatitis A and hepatitis B should base that decision on "shared clinical decision-making" with physicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's important that you partner with your pediatrician," Kravitz said Monday. "We are here to help you. We want to try to rid some of that confusion from families. So, we want you to bring your questions to us. We, as pediatricians, are going to follow the AAP recommendations, but we also want to have open lines of communication with our families."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AAP &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/34104" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;called the CDC's guidance&lt;/a&gt; "dangerous and unnecessary" at the time of its release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The AAP formerly partnered with the CDC to create a unified set of vaccine recommendations, but recent changes to the CDC immunization schedule depart from longstanding medical evidence and no longer offer the optimal way to prevent illnesses in children," the AAP said Monday. "By contrast, the AAP childhood and adolescent immunization schedules continue to recommend immunizations based on the specific disease risks and health care delivery in the United States."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, said in a statement Monday, "The updated CDC childhood schedule continues to protect children against serious diseases while aligning U.S. guidance with international norms," adding it would "work with states and clinicians to ensure families have clear, accurate information to make their own informed decisions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kravitz said insurance will still cover vaccines no longer recommended by the CDC, like the flu and COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The way the CDC recommended them is there is still the option to get those vaccines if you'd like them, so insurance should cover every vaccine as long as parents want them," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes in the CDC childhood vaccine recommendations followed &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-acip-vaccine-panel-hepatitis-b-birth-dose/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;a controversial December recommendation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on when children should receive their first dose of the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hepatitis-b-vaccine-vote-immunization-policy-public-trust/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;hepatitis B vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. For more than 30 years, the CDC advised that the first dose be given within 24 hours of birth. The CDC's vaccine advisory panel, which has been &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/acip-vaccine-panel-ousted-by-rfk-jr-speaks-out/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;hand-picked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by HHS Secretary &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/rfk-hearing-senate-finance-committee-cdc-vaccines/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, a longtime &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-vaccine-safety-aluminum-ingredients/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;vaccine critic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, voted to recommend delaying the shot until a child is 2 months old for those born to mothers who test negative for the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-says-it-may-be-better-if-fewer-children-receive-the-flu-vaccine/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes earlier this month, Kennedy insisted, "We're not taking vaccines away from anybody. If you want to get the vaccine, you can get it. It's gonna be fully covered by insurance, just like it was before."&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Kennedy did concede there is now an added step to getting children the flu vaccine, as it requires consultation with a physician first, rather than it being freely administered at a pharmacy, and he said it might be "a better thing" if fewer people get the flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

These genetic results highlight specific pathways, especially vitamin B1, as testable leads for the next stage of research, including lab experiments and carefully designed clinical studies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Found in foods like whole grains, meat, fish, and legumes, Vitamin B1 is an essential nutrient that plays various roles in the human body that scientists are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-just-confirmed-a-67-year-old-hypothesis-about-vitamin-b1"&gt;still learning about&lt;/a&gt;.

			&lt;p&gt;We know that physical exercise is good for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/10-minute-bursts-of-exercise-can-trigger-anti-cancer-signals-in-the-body"&gt;our health&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-single-one-hour-daily-walk-could-add-six-hours-to-your-lifespan"&gt; longevity&lt;/a&gt;, but new research shows how even the smallest differences in our daily habits can lead to meaningful benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on an analysis of wearable data from more than 130,000 people across several countries, just 5 minutes of extra exercise each day, or reducing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-revealed-how-much-exercise-you-need-to-offset-sitting-all-day"&gt;sitting time&lt;/a&gt; by half an hour, is linked to noticeable improvements in lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, led by a team from the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, focused on two groups: a high-risk group composed of the least active 20 percent of participants, and a broader population group comprising everyone except the most active 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-type-of-activity-is-particularly-effective-at-keeping-your-brain-young"&gt;One Type of Activity Is Particularly Effective at Keeping Your Brain Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Small and realistic increases in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity of 5 min/day might prevent up to 6 percent of all deaths in a high-risk approach and 10 percent of all deaths in a population-based approach," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)02219-6"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Reducing sedentary time by 30 min/day might prevent a smaller, but still meaningful, proportion of deaths in the two risk scenarios."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_189175" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189175" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/DeathsGraph.jpg" alt="Reduced deaths graph" class="wp-image-189175 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/DeathsGraph.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/DeathsGraph-600x382.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-189175" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;An extra 5 minutes of exercise a day made the most difference for those exercising the least. (Ekelund et al., &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;, 2026)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These figures were generated using statistical models rather than tracking participants' activity over time. Instead, each person's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-simple-blood-test-could-reveal-your-chances-of-dying-in-the-next-decade"&gt;risk of death&lt;/a&gt; was estimated and compared with that of their peers, allowing researchers to model how changes in activity levels might impact their risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's notable that the biggest benefits were predicted among people who were typically less active and spent more of the day sitting. In other words, in terms of physical exercise and avoiding a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-the-ideal-number-of-daily-steps-to-offset-sitting-down"&gt;sedentary lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;, those who are currently doing the least stand to gain the most from making relatively small changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the observational nature of the study leaves it short of proving a direct cause-and-effect relationship, the large datasets involved and the significance of the association suggest it's something worth studying further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" class="alignnone wp-image-189354 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We only investigated all-cause mortality; thus, future research should examine other health outcomes," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)02219-6"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Additional research using device-measured physical activity is needed in low-income and middle-income countries where the age structure, physical activity levels, and disease burden differ from those included in the present study."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings offer encouragement for people who struggle to find the time or motivation to exercise regularly. Even just a few minutes of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-walking-style-can-have-surprising-health-benefits-study-says"&gt;brisk walking&lt;/a&gt; or cycling, or half an hour of doing something that isn't sitting, may make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/not-all-sitting-is-equal-one-type-was-just-linked-to-better-brain-health"&gt;Not All Sitting Is Equal. One Type Was Just Linked to Better Brain Health.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's still the case that more exercise is better for you, of course – &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/behealthy/physical-activity"&gt;the World Health Organization recommends&lt;/a&gt; 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity a week – but small steps still make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A clear message we want to get across is that every movement counts and getting inactive people to do some activity is where we see the biggest gains in health," &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-small-achievable-changes-in-physical-activity-linked-to-lower-mortality-risks/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; sedentary behavior scientist Daniel Bailey from Brunel University of London, who wasn't involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So, GPs, policymakers, or campaigners can certainly be looking to support patients and the public with making these relatively small changes to start with, which would give people a starting point to then kick on and increase their activity even more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)02219-6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

This month, the Department of Health and Human Services &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2026-01-05/u-s-changes-childhood-vaccine-schedule-to-require-fewer-immunizations" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:announced drastic changes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced drastic changes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the CDC’s vaccine schedule, slashing the number of diseases that it recommends U.S. children be routinely vaccinated against to 11 from 17. That follows the CDC's decision last year to reverse its recommendation that all kids get the COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On Monday, the AAP released its own &lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP-Immunization-Schedule.pdf?_gl=1*5x36zh*_ga*MjI5NzM0NzQzLjE3NTEyNTc4Mjc.*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*czE3Njk0NTkyNzQkbzQxJGcwJHQxNzY5NDU5Mjc0JGo2MCRsMCRoMA.." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:immunization guidelines;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;immunization guidelines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which now look very different from the federal government’s. The organization, which represents most of the nation’s primary care and specialty doctors for children, recommends that children continue to be routinely vaccinated against 18 diseases, just as the CDC did before Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took over the nation’s health agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Endorsed by a dozen medical groups, the AAP schedule is far and away the preferred version for most healthcare practitioners.

AAP advises that children get two doses of HPV vaccine starting at ages 9 to12, while the CDC recommends one dose at age 11 or 12.

In September, a key CDC advisory panel stocked with hand-picked Kennedy appointees recommended that the MMR and varicella vaccines &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-09-18/acip-rfk-jr-vote-mmr-shots" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:be given as separate shots;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;be given as separate shots&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a move that confounded public health experts for its seeming lack of scientific basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The AAP is one of several medical groups &lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/FiledSuit.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:suing HHS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;suing HHS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

As you slowly introduce them back, one by one, you see how your body responds. The goal is to determine what foods may trigger you specifically so you can limit them for the sake of better and smoother digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="factors" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Replace Missing Digestive Factors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just about what you eat—it’s also about how your comprehensive digestive system breaks down and absorbs the nutrients from what you eat. Our bodies naturally produce &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-digestive-enyzmes" target="_blank"&gt;digestive enzymes&lt;/a&gt;, typically in the salivary glands, pancreas, and small intestines, to help break down food efficiently to allow for maximum nutrient absorption. If your body is struggling to make enough digestive enzymes, it can cause uncomfortable side effects around meal time like cramping, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, and more. “Digestive support like digestive bitters or enzymes are generally supportive and well tolerated by most people,” says Gerber, who notes that those with active gallstones or kidney stones should avoid bitters. &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-electrolyte-drink" target="_blank"&gt;Electrolytes&lt;/a&gt; with foundational minerals like sodium, potassium, and magnesium can be beneficial as a baseline, too. “We need minerals to help make digestive juices like stomach acid and digestive enzymes,” adds Gerber. “Digestive bitters and enzymes naturally help upregulate your own digestive juice secretions,” says Gerber. “It gives a natural nudge to your stomach acid digestive enzymes and bile to help you digest your food better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How you eat your food is crucial too. “Start with chewing well,” says Gerber who suggests 10-12 chews per bite—ideally until liquefied before you swallow. “And slow down, take deep breaths, and sit down for all meals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

Bacteria&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably heard about “good” bacteria versus “bad” bacteria. Bad bacteria can cause illness, inflammation, and digestive issues when they overgrow, invade, and crowd out the beneficial bacteria. Certain medications, like antibiotics, stress as well as diets high in ultra-processed foods, refined sugars, and more are associated with bad gut microbes. “There’s as many bacteria as there are cells in our body and 100 times as much bacterial DNA as regulating everything about our health,” says Hyman. When you’re in gut repair mode, it’s crucial to bring back the good bacteria. “Your good gut bugs love diversity when it comes to allowing them to flourish and survive,” says Gerber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-probiotic-for-women" target="_blank"&gt;Probiotic&lt;/a&gt;-rich foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, pickles, unsweetened yogurt or kefir, miso, and more introduce live, good bacteria directly into your gut. &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-prebiotics" target="_blank"&gt;Prebiotic&lt;/a&gt; fiber, the soluble fibers found in Jerusalem artichoke, garlic, onions, leeks, dandelion greens, jicama, chicory root, asparagus, and more, are essential too. They act as fuel for the probiotics, providing energy to help nourish and grow beneficial bacteria. “Eat an abundance of polyphenol-rich vegetables daily,” says Hyman. Polyphenols act as prebiotics and can help inhibit harmful bacteria, too. Some great examples are spinach, broccoli, carrots, artichokes, red onion, and asparagus. If your diet is lacking these essential nutrients, a high-quality comprehensive probiotic supplement can help restore microbiome balance, as can a multivitamin and prebiotic fiber to support intestinal health and gut barrier function. However, while probiotics can be wonderful tools for supporting gut health for many people, there is some nuance, and your symptoms, history, and tolerance should be taken into consideration. “Not all probiotics are created equally,” says Fazio. “Different strains and profiles can deliver different targeted results so it’s best to find the specific one that will work for you with a trusted practitioner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="repair" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Repair the Gut Lining&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your gut flora will thrive when it’s consistently fueled with a wide variety of plant fibers from vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and seeds. However, there’s only a thin cell layer between your intestines and body—and that determines what should be absorbed into your body. Think of it as a coffee filter: the filter prevents the grounds from getting into your coffee, leaving you with only the clear, rich liquid. But if there’s a hole in your filter, the grounds can leak into your coffee. The same is true for your intestines—if you have increased intestinal permeability (a.k.a., leaky gut) what &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; leak into your body is fungus, not-so-good bacteria, or undigested food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 01:02:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTFBWbnI3Z1QtaXhoSi1tNXRTai1nQllub3FnMkg1d19ZQmxVNGVEdjRUOVFzUkdHekVOWWg5eWFSVXhHX1ZrZ3Z1TUdkblc0RmY0S1k3eGk1YW9hdjg1SFMw</guid></item><item><title>与阿尔茨海默氏症样大脑变化相关的更年期-英国广播公司</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qpp1g5ylvo</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 idLnWK"&gt;Menopause linked to Alzheimer's-like brain changes&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline" class="sc-3adb3607-0 fkltMW"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-contributors" class="sc-3adb3607-12 csUdlZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-contributors-contributor-0" class="sc-3adb3607-5 iMnQuR"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-3adb3607-7 echTHp"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-3adb3607-8 dcphMW"&gt;Michelle Roberts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-contributors-contributor-0-role-location" class="sc-3adb3607-9 dRohlg"&gt;Digital health editor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 eRlINq"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/dc0f/live/2d494aa0-fae8-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/dc0f/live/2d494aa0-fae8-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dc0f/live/2d494aa0-fae8-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/dc0f/live/2d494aa0-fae8-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/dc0f/live/2d494aa0-fae8-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/dc0f/live/2d494aa0-fae8-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/dc0f/live/2d494aa0-fae8-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dc0f/live/2d494aa0-fae8-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images Scientist looking at 3D rendered graphic scans" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The menopause is linked to changes in the brain similar to those seen in Alzheimer's, according to a large UK study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The loss of grey matter in areas involved with memory and emotion might partly explain why women are generally at greater risk of dementia than men, researchers speculate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The findings come from nearly 125,000 women, of whom 11,000 had MRI brain scans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In the study, published in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291725102845" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;Psychological Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use did not appear to prevent the grey matter loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Prof Barbara Sahakian, senior author and from Cambridge University, said: "The brain regions where we saw these differences are ones that tend to be affected by Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Menopause could make these women vulnerable further down the line.

But may of those already had poorer mental health before being prescribed the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Co-researcher Dr Christelle Langley said it was important to recognise the variety of struggles that can come with menopause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We all need to be more sensitive to not only the physical, but also the mental health of women during menopause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"There should be no embarrassment in letting others know what you're going through and asking for help."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Michelle Dyson from the Alzheimer's Society said women account for around two-thirds of people living with Alzheimer's disease in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"And while we still don't fully understand why they are more susceptible than men, it is thought that hormones may play a role," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"This large study adds to evidence showing how menopause impacts the brain, including physical changes such as loss of brain volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"But without long-term participant tracking, to check if they later develop dementia, we cannot be sure that these brain changes associated with menopause also increase dementia risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She said getting regular exercise, not smoking and limiting alcohol intake can help cut the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:04:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE14eERsaTEwUkVxcFh0Ni1VNU5JbHUzQ0dxQXpQNVhvMnJfSW8zTTZGMmhIbU1NbkVHbXhiVVlRQk5GTmFoTXNidkNDSllrb3JQZUVMXzJaT0Q1UQ</guid></item><item><title>NHS英格兰试用人工智能和机器人工具来检测和诊断肺癌-卫报</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/jan/27/nhs-england-to-trial-ai-and-robotic-tools-to-detect-and-diagnose-lung-cancer</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;NHS &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/england" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; is to trial a combination of AI and robot-assisted care to speed up the detection and diagnosis of lung cancer, the UK’s most lethal form of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The trial comes at the same time as the health service pledges to offer all smokers and ex-smokers the chance to be screened for lung cancer by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That expansion will lead to an estimated 50,000 lung cancers being diagnosed by 2035, of which 23,000 will be at early stage, which could save thousands of lives, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The disease is a particular focus of the government’s forthcoming national cancer plan for England because it is Britain’s biggest cancer killer, reflecting historic high rates of smoking. It &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/lung-cancer" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;claims 33,100 lives a year&lt;/a&gt; across the UK, about 91 a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is also a key area for improvement because it is a stark example of health inequalities that mirror people’s wealth. It affects poorer people so disproportionately that it accounts for an entire year of the nine-year gap in life expectancy between England’s most and least deprived areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;NHS chiefs hope that deploying AI and robotic technology will help doctors uncover more cases, which will enable treatment to start sooner and enhance the patient’s chances of survival. The trial will be undertaken at Guy’s and St Thomas’ &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; trust in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This is a glimpse of the future of cancer detection”, said Prof Peter Johnson, NHS England’s national clinical director for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the trial, AI software will analyse lung scans and alert doctors to the presence of small lumps – some just 6mm long, the size of a grain of rice – that are most likely to be cancerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A robotic camera will then guide the miniature tools used to undertake a biopsy, to produce a sample of tissue that can be analysed in a laboratory more precisely than with existing techniques. That will enable potentially cancerous nodules hidden deep in someone’s lung, which are hard to spot at present, to be removed and examined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If shown to be effective, the technology could help transform lung cancer diagnosis as the NHS screening programme increasingly identifies more people with very small nodules that would previously have gone undetected until much later”, NHS England said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“For many patients, weeks of repeat scans and procedures could be replaced with a single half-hour cancer biopsy, reducing prolonged uncertainty and avoiding more invasive surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;index&amp;quot;:11,&amp;quot;listId&amp;quot;:4156,&amp;quot;identityName&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;morning-briefing&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;First Edition&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;frequency&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Every weekday&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;successDescription&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;We'll send you First Edition every weekday&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;theme&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;news&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;idApiUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://idapi.theguardian.com&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;hideNewsletterSignupComponentForSubscribers&amp;quot;:true}"&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The team behind the trial has already carried out about 300 robotic biopsies, which led to 215 people having cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the UK, but diagnosing it at an earlier stage can significantly improve people’s chances of survival”, said the chief executive of Cancer Research UK, Michelle Mitchell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“New technologies like this have huge potential, and tests to ensure they’re accurate and beneficial for patients in the real world should happen quickly so that innovations can reach everyone sooner.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxOaTJzbzlUOXdmX2lscGNsSGxTcFliekktSF9SY1FKelBiMFpOMlh3SjZKS1JRM1BKamhmSW5MVlJTWEstbDQtT0JTeTltdWF3cVhwM2tLTW9MdUNINXRvUlE0SkdqUWkzbjJFR2hjWnd2eHJmd21xYlV2Wi02Ri1aUGgzMmxpQlZyOFZVWld4VFJRSzhxTDJUYjlCbDJqeWZBX21IVWtOaUFQcURlMEVIMGs5NmZubVlxamJlQ3Y4ajBOUQ</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，数十个CDC数据库尚未更新—大多数与疫苗有关- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-databases-not-updated-vaccines-study-rcna255467</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-029a28" class="body-graf"&gt;Nearly half of the databases that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention used to update regularly — surveillance systems that tracked public health information like Covid vaccination rates and hospitalizations for respiratory syncytial virus — have been paused without explanation, according to new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-be0222" class="body-graf"&gt;The findings, &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-04022" target="_blank"&gt;published Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, indicate that at the start of 2025, the CDC maintained 82 databases that were updated at least monthly. But by the end of October, the study found, 38 had gone stale, with 34 showing no new entries at all in the previous six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-43efd1" class="body-graf"&gt;“These unexplained pauses started predominantly in March and April 2025, shortly after Mr. Trump assumed the presidency and Mr. Kennedy was confirmed as Secretary of Health and Human Services,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-76ec03" class="body-graf"&gt;Although the CDC is perhaps best known for issuing public health advisories and recommendations, the agency also plays a key role as a national record-keeper, tracking the spread of infections and uptake of vaccines in as close to real time as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e4be76" class="body-graf"&gt;But the CDC appears to be backing away from that part of its work, the new research suggests. The study found that nearly 90% of the paused databases were related to vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-67da31" class="body-graf"&gt;As examples, study author Dr. Jeremy Jacobs, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University, pointed to one database that monitored weekly Covid vaccinations among pregnant women and another that tracked Covid vaccinations among all U.S. adults (with breakdowns based on demographics and geographical region). Both were last updated in late April, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d65493" class="body-graf"&gt;Other out-of-date databases looked at respiratory illnesses treated in emergency departments and the use of an injectable drug that can protect infants from RSV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-341565" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s curious that all these changes are primarily, and almost exclusively, in the area of vaccination,” said Noel Brewer, another study author and a professor of public health at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7e434c" class="body-graf"&gt;“On the face of this, this all looks fairly deliberate, but we don’t really know why these websites went silent,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-90c721" class="body-graf"&gt;Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Health and Human Services Department, said the CDC reports Covid and RSV activity through its respiratory virus surveillance systems and reports weekly flu activity through a database called FluView.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9b3a85" class="body-graf"&gt;“Changes to individual dashboards or update schedules reflect routine data quality and system management decisions, not political direction,” Nixon said in a statement. “Under this administration, public health data reporting is driven by scientific integrity, transparency, and accuracy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d1feb1" class="body-graf"&gt;Without current information from these databases, several public health experts said, it is more difficult to know what vaccination coverage looks like on the national or regional level — which, consequently, can make it harder to deal with new outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ec70f8" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Lisa Lee, senior associate vice president for research and innovation at Virginia Tech, spent 14 years at the CDC, including as chief science officer in the agency’s office of surveillance and epidemiology. She said local health officials often rely on CDC databases to guide their responses to public health crises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a3c48f" class="body-graf"&gt;“If we, for example, see wild-type polio again in our country because we have reduced uptake of vaccine, that is the surveillance system that’s telling us this information,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0f83f6" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, chief executive officer of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-05527" target="_blank"&gt;an editorial&lt;/a&gt; also published Monday in Annals of Internal Medicine that the lapse in updates — whether intentional or not — demonstrates “a profound disregard for human life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ce49c4" class="body-graf"&gt;“The evidence is damning: The administration’s antivaccine stance has interrupted the reliable flow of the data we need to keep Americans safe from preventable infections,” she said. Marrazzo served as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases until September, when Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired her. She is suing Kennedy and other Trump administration officials, alleging she was let go in part because of her strong defense of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-75f101" class="body-graf"&gt;In the new study, the authors — a team of public health and medical experts and one law professor — suggest that the CDC may have stopped updating the databases due to reductions in its workforce, budget cuts or shifting attitudes about vaccines among federal health officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2dd37b" class="body-graf"&gt;Their findings reflect a larger trend of changes to the CDC’s website, some involving unreliable information that contradicts scientific consensus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-32e6b9" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is especially concerning, given the broader context. There’s misinformation about vaccines and vaccine safety being disseminated through official channels at HHS by non-health professionals,” Lee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1431de" class="body-graf"&gt;In November, a web page that once unequivocally stated that vaccines do not cause autism was &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-autism-vaccines-webpage-studies-changes-language-rcna244936" target="_blank"&gt;rewritten to say&lt;/a&gt; that “studies have not ruled out the possibility.” The message flew in the face of decades of scientific research that has found no link between autism and vaccines. Prior to that, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/federal-websites-temporarily-go-dark-order-comply-trump-dei-directive-rcna190244" target="_blank"&gt;removed language&lt;/a&gt; pertaining to gender identity and diversity, equity, inclusion, including &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-dei-hiv-cdc-website-removed-lgbtq-rcna190068" target="_blank"&gt;information on HIV&lt;/a&gt; and contraception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1d588c" class="body-graf"&gt;The website changes are part of a broader overhaul of the country’s public health agencies under Kennedy’s leadership. In the year since he became health secretary, the U.S. has &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/covid-vaccine-kids-pregnant-women-cdc-recommendation-rfk-jr-rcna207312" target="_blank"&gt;stopped recommending routine Covid shots for healthy kids&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-cuts-500-million-mrna-vaccine-contracts-dealing-major-blow-prom-rcna223281" target="_blank"&gt;slashed funding for mRNA vaccine research&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-vaccines-overhaul-kids-denmark-fewer-childhood-shots-rcna250055" target="_blank"&gt;overhauled the childhood vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt; to include fewer universal recommendations. Kennedy also fired the CDC’s previous committee of vaccine advisers and replaced them with a group that has largely expressed skepticism of the shots. In December, the new panel &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-stops-recommending-hepatitis-b-vaccines-newborns-rcna248035" target="_blank"&gt;rolled back a decadeslong recommendation&lt;/a&gt; to vaccinate all newborns against hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1755f9" class="body-graf"&gt;“It pains me to say that you need to really look at some of these recommendations with caution,” Marrazzo said. “If I were a parent, I would trust my board-certified pediatrician, who hopefully is a member of, or aligned with, the American Academy of Pediatrics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eb06f3" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;The academy on Monday released its own &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/15585/?autologincheck=redirected&amp;amp;_gl=1*182sr3a*_ga*MTAwMjU1Mzg4Ni4xNzY5NDYzNTg2*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*czE3Njk0NjM1ODYkbzEkZzAkdDE3Njk0NjM1ODYkajYwJGwwJGgw*_gcl_au*NzYwMTAxMDI5LjE3Njk0NjM1ODU.*_ga_GMZCQS1K47*czE3Njk0NjM1ODYkbzEkZzAkdDE3Njk0NjM1ODYkajYwJGwwJGgw" target="_blank"&gt;guidance for childhood vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, which is similar to the schedule the CDC recommended before Kennedy announced sweeping changes earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 22:41:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxNX25pZVVmbTJqeGNoNGRWeE1FWU5QOFBoMktVZ05BWUNDVDBHY0pXa0hELVViSDZPdE16NTBuSUJac1pkTEVxdzlpcnJkcVhqM3puNEdMcnpxYS1nbFRDamhtU1BuejltZWtRXy1TVW5IYW9RcWRIbEJKNVhiSm84T3FhRXpDRTktNXZpUVFEOU0xTFVKZWVfeTF3</guid></item><item><title>发现肾结石形成中以前未知的细菌成分- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2026-01-previously-unknown-bacterial-component-kidney.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="success-screen" id="successScreen"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Researchers have discovered that eight different psychiatric conditions share a common genetic basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in early 2025 pinpointed specific variants among those shared genes, showing how they behave during brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US team found many of these variants remain active for extended periods, potentially influencing multiple developmental stages – and offering new targets for treatments that could address several disorders at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-traces-autisms-origin-to-the-rise-of-human-intelligence"&gt;Study Traces Autism's Origin to The Rise of Human Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The proteins produced by these genes are also highly connected to other proteins," &lt;a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/genetics/eight-psychiatric-disorders-share-the-same-genetic-causes-study-says/"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; University of North Carolina geneticist Hyejung Won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Changes to these proteins in particular could ripple through the network, potentially causing widespread effects on the brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2019, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.11.020"&gt;an international team&lt;/a&gt; first identified 109 genes linked in different combinations with eight psychiatric disorders:  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="190112" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="190112" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="190112" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, Tourette syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and anorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may explain why these conditions often co-occur – for example &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389%2Ffpsyt.2022.837424"&gt;up to 70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of individuals diagnosed with autism or ADHD have the other too  – and why they frequently cluster in families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_150776" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-150776" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/HumanPrecurserNeuronsDay11WithDifferentProteinMarkersStainedInRedAndGreen-e1738614042645-642x212.jpg" alt="These Eight Psychiatric Disorders Have a Surprising Genetic Connection" class="wp-image-150776 size-medium" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-150776" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Human precursor neurons with protein expression stained in different colors, indicating the type of neurons developing. (Won et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these eight conditions also has gene differences that are unique to them individually, so Won and team compared the unique genes with those shared between the disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They took almost 18,000 variations of the shared and unique genes involved and put them into the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"&gt;precursor cells&lt;/a&gt; that become our neurons to see how they could impact gene expression in these cells during human development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This allowed the researchers to identify 683 genetic variants that impacted gene regulation and to further explore them in neurons from developing mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic variants behind multiple seemingly unrelated traits, or in this case conditions, are called&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiotropy"&gt; pleiotropic&lt;/a&gt;. The pleiotropic variants were involved in many more protein-to-protein interactions than the gene variants unique to specific psychological conditions, and they were active across more types of brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164084" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164084" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-642x642.jpg" alt="Several Psychiatric Disorders Share The Same Root Cause, Study Finds" class="size-medium wp-image-164084" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-642x642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-600x600.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164084" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;This simple genotype-phenotype map only shows additive pleiotropy effects.

&lt;p&gt;He then pondered out loud what would happen if people stopped getting vaccinated. “If we take away all of the herd immunity, then does that switch, does that teeter-totter switch in a different direction?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Backlash&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, AMA Trustee Sandra Adamson Fryhofer blasted the question. “This is not a theoretical debate—it is a dangerous step backward,” she said. “Vaccines have saved millions of lives and virtually eliminated devastating diseases like polio in the United States. There is no cure for polio. When vaccination rates fall, paralysis, lifelong disability, and death return. The science on this is settled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fryhofer also took aim at Milhoan’s repeated argument that the focus of vaccination policy should move from population-level health to individual autonomy. Moving away from routine immunizations, which include discussions between clinicians and patients, “does not increase freedom—it increases suffering,” she said, adding that the weakening of recommendations “will cost lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Milhoan’s comments only further erode the relevance of ACIP and federal vaccine policy among the medical community and states. According to &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/state-health-policy-data/state-recommendations-for-routine-childhood-vaccines-increasing-departure-from-federal-guidelines/"&gt;a KFF policy brief&lt;/a&gt;, 27 states and Washington, DC, have already announced they will not follow current CDC vaccine recommendations, which &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/under-anti-vaccine-rfk-jr-cdc-slashes-childhood-vaccine-schedule/"&gt;Kennedy dramatically overhauled&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month without even consulting the ACIP. Instead, the majority of states are relying on previous recommendations or recommendations made within states or by medical organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the American Academy of Pediatrics &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2025/american-academy-of-pediatric-issues-recommended-childhood-and-adolescent-immunization-schedule-for-2026/"&gt;announced the 2026 update&lt;/a&gt; to its &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-075754/206175/Recommended-Childhood-and-Adolescent-Immunization?autologincheck=redirected"&gt;childhood and adolescent vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt;, which it has held up as an alternative to the CDC’s schedule and has been widely embraced by pediatricians. In the announcement, AAP noted that 12 other medical organizations have endorsed the schedule, including the AMA, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AAP’s updated recommendations are largely the same as the schedule from last year, but it is significantly different from the CDC’s recommendations, which “depart from longstanding medical evidence and no longer offer the optimal way to prevent illnesses in children,” the AAP said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The AAP will continue to provide recommendations for immunizations that are rooted in science and are in the best interest of the health of infants, children and adolescents of this country,” AAP President Andrew Racine said in the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The enemy of our enemy could very well become our friend. Scientists have possibly uncovered a new approach to treating Alzheimer’s disease—one tied to the development of cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China studied mice given human cancers. These mice were protected from Alzheimer’s, they found, likely due to a protein produced by tumor cells known as cystatin-C, or cyst-C. The research could lead to novel treatments for the currently incurable form of dementia, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These findings provide significant conceptual advances into cancer neuroscience and establish therapeutic avenues that are distinct from present amyloid-lowering strategies, the authors wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)01433-3"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this month in the journal Cell.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A strange heated rivalry&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;With their work, the team was hoping to unravel a peculiar phenomenon &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/nov/16/are-cancer-survivors-less-likely-to-develop-alzheimers"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; by past studies: People diagnosed with cancer are less likely to later develop Alzheimer’s. Even stranger, this pattern goes &lt;a href="https://www.musc.edu/content-hub/News/2025/10/01/Alzheimer-protein-holds-clues-for-fighting-cancer"&gt;both ways&lt;/a&gt;, since people with Alzheimer’s also seem less likely to catch cancer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They experimented with mice predisposed to develop Alzheimer’s. They gave the mice (via transplantation) various cancers taken from people: lung, colon, and prostate cancer. Compared to the control group, the cancer-bearing mice didn’t develop a high level of amyloid plaques in their brains, a key biomarker of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers then went looking for a specific cause behind this protection. They ultimately found the tumor cells in these mice were producing noticeable amounts of cyst-C, and that the protein was able to travel through the bloodstream, bypass the blood-brain barrier, and reach the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In subsequent mice experiments, they found evidence that cyst-C could bind to amyloid oligomers, the toxic clumps of amyloid that are a precursor to plaques. The cyst-C also seemed to activate microglia, the specialized immune cells of the brain, via a receptor called TREM2. Furthermore, it appeared that these activated microglia were better at clearing out amyloid plaques.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And when they gave their Alzheimer’s mice added amounts of cyst-C, the mice became better at solving mazes, indicating their cognition and memory had improved.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;What does it all mean?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This research, impressive as it is, is still in its early days. More studies will be needed to know whether cyst-C’s effects against Alzheimer’s can actually be seen in people as opposed to mice, for instance. Even if this work does bear fruit, no one’s suggesting that we should try to get cancer as a way to avoid Alzheimer’s down the road.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That said, the findings certainly do provide more places for scientists to start looking for the next Alzheimer’s treatment, whether it’s in cyst-C, TREM2 activation, or other compounds produced by cancer cells. That’s more help we urgently need. It’s &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12040760/"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; at least 7 million Americans currently have Alzheimer’s, a number that could nearly double within the next few decades. And even the best medications today only modestly slow the progression of the disease, which is still currently 100% fatal.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

In fact, your gut microbiome is so embedded in your overall well-being that it likely plays a role in every kind of dysfunction, big or small, &lt;a href="https://changlab.uchicago.edu/personnel/" target="_blank"&gt;Orlando “Landon” DeLeon, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, a research assistant professor at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, tells SELF. In fact, he adds, “you can name a condition, and there’s probably an associated microbiome pathway or pathways”—cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease, Parkinson’s, you name it. What’s more, existing forms of dysfunction can feed off of each other, creating a vicious cycle that only makes the problem worse: “We know for a lot of those conditions that it’s a somewhat self-propagating loop,” Dr. DeLeon says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The silver lining to all of this? If you think or know your gut microbiome might not be in the best shape, there are some concrete measures you can take to improve its balance. Read on to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to treat an unhealthy gut microbiome&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your gut microbiome makeup is largely determined by your diet, &lt;a data-offer-url="https://einsteinmed.edu/faculty/19364/mykhaylo-usyk" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://einsteinmed.edu/faculty/19364/mykhaylo-usyk"}' href="https://einsteinmed.edu/faculty/19364/mykhaylo-usyk" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mykhaylo Usyk, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, research assistant professor of microbiology and immunology and of pediatrics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, tells SELF, so modifying your eating habits is the first step toward positive change. Here are five easy ways to make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Eat more fermented foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/best-fermented-foods-for-gut-health" target="_blank"&gt;Fermented foods&lt;/a&gt; refer to items produced through controlled microbial growth and, as such, can contain beneficial live microbes. When you eat those items, they introduce the bugs directly into your gut, supporting the overall balance (hence the frequently assigned “probiotic” label). Because of this, “things like &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/greek-yogurt-snack-tips" target="_blank"&gt;yogurt&lt;/a&gt; or sauerkraut or kimchi or miso” are becoming more popular as people wise up to their substantial health benefits, &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.vinccitsui.com/about" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.vinccitsui.com/about"}' href="https://www.vinccitsui.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Vincci Tsui, RD&lt;/a&gt;, a certified intuitive eating counselor based in Canada, tells SELF. That said, keep in mind that there are a lot of unknowns surrounding any one fermented product: “We don’t really know how much bacteria [it contains], or what types of bacteria are still present in the food and what the effects are,” Tsui cautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Take a (legit) probiotic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re trying to treat a specific issue—like the ones we called out above—a &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/probiotic-supplements-for-gut-health" target="_blank"&gt;probiotic supplement&lt;/a&gt; could be a better choice than a fermented food, according to Tsui. While the two can overlap, probiotics differ from fermented foods in that they have to offer “a certain amount of a specific [microbial] strain” that has been &lt;em&gt;proven&lt;/em&gt; to confer a health benefit, Tsui says. Basically, they have to adhere to more rigorous standards and, in turn, are better studied and can yield a more targeted impact. “Different strains often have different effects,” Tsui says, so you can pick and choose between options depending on the symptom you want to address, and thus the strain that is most likely to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just make sure to choose a probiotic that has some strong scientific backing behind it, since the space is rife with dubious claims. For assistance, Tsui recommends checking out &lt;a data-offer-url="http://probioticchart.com" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"http://probioticchart.com"}' href="http://probioticchart.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;probioticchart.com&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical guide that breaks down available probiotic research to help consumers decide if a specific probiotic is right for them (a recommendation Desiree Nielsen, RD, previously made to SELF as well). “It's a really good resource that I use as a clinician when people are complaining about specific symptoms like &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/health-conditions/irritable-bowel-syndrome-ibs" target="_blank"&gt;IBS&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/health-conditions/constipation" target="_blank"&gt;constipation&lt;/a&gt;, or if they are [dealing with] &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/foods-to-heal-gut-after-antibiotics" target="_blank"&gt;post-antibiotic changes&lt;/a&gt; to gut health,” Tsui says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Or prioritize prebiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can think of prebiotics as a &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/probiotics-vs-prebiotics" target="_blank"&gt;probiotic precursor&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to probiotics, which refer to beneficial microorganisms themselves (as we explained above), prebiotics refer to the nutrients that probiotics feed on in the digestive tract and that support their development as a result. Most prebiotics amount to specific types of &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/how-to-eat-more-fiber" target="_blank"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, including inulin, fructo-oligosaccharides, and galacto-oligosaccharides. “Our bodies can’t digest fiber, so it makes it all the way down to our colon or large intestine, where our gut bacteria live,” Tsui says. There, they serve as fuel—so “when we are eating prebiotic foods” (oats; almonds; bananas; soy products like miso, tofu, tempeh, and soy milk; artichokes; beans; peas; onions; flaxseed; eggplant; cabbage; asparagus; honey; and agave, to name a few options), “we’re sort of encouraging certain [beneficial] bacteria to grow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Eat more fiber, period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond prioritizing prebiotics specifically, “focusing on increasing your fiber intake in &lt;em&gt;general&lt;/em&gt;” can go a long way in boosting your gut health, since the carb can also help ease digestion and alleviate constipation, Tsui says. (Hence why &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/fibermaxxing-tiktok-trend" target="_blank"&gt;fibermaxxing&lt;/a&gt; is hardly the worst gut health trend out there!) To do this, choose “more whole grains, fruits, vegetables, beans and legumes, nuts and seeds”—more plant-based foods on the whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Maybe even…double down on dairy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, milk containing lactose supports healthy bacteria,” Dr. Usyk says—especially in people who don’t have the capacity to break down lactose (like those with lactose intolerance), though that may sound counterintuitive. Here’s how it works: Following the same trajectory as fiber, that undigested lactose passes on to the large intestine, serving as a food source for certain beneficial “bugs” and reducing lactose intolerance symptoms like gas and bloating over time. Several studies have found that consuming milk, yogurt, and kefir can increase beneficial &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; bacteria. What’s more, another study found that consuming yogurt decreased pathogenic (harmful) &lt;em&gt;Bacteroides fragilis&lt;/em&gt;, though further research is needed. (FYI, both yogurt and kefir are produced through fermentation—another win for fermented foods!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SELF Magazine</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 20:58:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE93WXB0S1ltMEZfb29tZEw0dWhQOHF5a3ZUdGhhS0pTWHU1VEo3cHAwU3FYdks0WXRkazZ5U0VRaU1EY0xOZ0VZblpCT2ZyTkZZWS1ZMWZ1ekZnWTl6UHM0ZURtdTRYQ21nX0tHX3JkLTEzU3c</guid></item><item><title>马尔堡病毒病-埃塞俄比亚-世界卫生组织（ WHO ）</title><link>https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2026-DON592</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="sf-detail-body-wrapper don-revamp"&gt;
        

                

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;Situation at a glance&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p class="don-content"&gt;
            On 26 January 2026, the Ministry of Health of Ethiopia declared the end of the Marburg virus disease (MVD) outbreak. This declaration came after two consecutive incubation periods (a total of 42 days) since the last person confirmed with MVD died and was given a safe and dignified burial, in accordance with WHO recommendations on 14 December 2025. As of 25 January 2026, a cumulative total of 19 cases, including 14 confirmed (including nine deaths) and five probable cases (all deaths), were reported. 
A total of 857 contacts listed for monitoring all had completed their 21-day follow-up as of 25 January 2026.

WHO, through its country office and partners, provided technical, operational and financial support to the government to contain this outbreak. 
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;Description of the situation&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;On 14 November 2025, after the laboratory confirmation of suspected viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) cases in Jinka town, South Ethiopia Regional State, Ethiopia, the Ministry of Health of Ethiopia declared an outbreak of Marburg Virus Disease (MVD). Molecular testing conducted by the National Reference Laboratory at the Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI) identified Marburg virus (MARV) in patient samples. This was the first time Ethiopia was reporting a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON585" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;MVD outbreak&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first known case was an adult from Jinka town who developed symptoms on 23 October. The patient presented to the General Hospital the following day with vomiting, loss of appetite, and abdominal cramps. As of 25 January 2026, a cumulative total of 14 confirmed cases, including nine deaths (Case Fatality Rate (CFR) 64.3%) and five probable cases, all of whom had died, were reported by the Ministry of Health from Jinka, Malle and Dasench woredas in South Ethiopia Region and Hawassa in Sidama Region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 25 January 2026, a total of 857 contacts were listed who completed 21 days of follow-up, 760 from the South Ethiopia Region and 97 from the Sidama Region. As of 5 January 2026, 3800 samples were tested for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 26 January 2026, after two consecutive incubation periods (a total of 42 days), without a new confirmed case reported, after the last confirmed case died and was given a safe and dignified burial, on 14 December 2025, the Ministry of Health of Ethiopia declared the end of the MVD outbreak, as per WHO recommendations.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Map of districts reporting confirmed and probable Marburg virus disease cases in Ethiopia, as of 25 January 2026&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sf-image-responsive="true" src="https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/products/disease-outbreak-news/map-for-marburg-virus-disease-in-ethiopia.png?sfvrsn=15b744e9_3" title="Map for Marburg virus disease in Ethiopia" alt="Map for Marburg virus disease in Ethiopia" sf-size="118205"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;p class="don-images d-block d-lg-none"&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;Epidemiology&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Marburg virus disease (MVD) is a severe disease caused by either of two closely related viruses, Marburg virus and Ravn virus.  MVD has a high case fatality rate, ranging from 24% to 88% from previous outbreaks. The CFR can be lowered with early supportive patient care. The virus is initially transmitted to humans from fruit bats (&lt;em&gt;Rousettus aegyptiacus&lt;/em&gt;) and then spreads among people through direct contact with bodily fluids, contaminated surfaces, or infected materials. Healthcare workers, caregivers, and individuals involved in burial practices are particularly at risk when appropriate infection, prevention and control measures are not in place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MVD symptoms typically begin abruptly after an incubation period of two to 21 days and include high fever, severe headache, malaise, muscle aches, and progressive gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting. In severe cases, patients may experience bleeding from multiple sites and die from shock and organ failure within a week of symptom onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no approved treatment or vaccines for MVD, although early supportive care improves survival. Some candidate vaccines and therapeutics are currently under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nineteen outbreaks of MVD have previously been reported globally. The most &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON552" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; outbreak was reported from the Republic of Tanzania between January and March 2025. Additional countries that have reported outbreaks of MVD in the African Region include Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa, and Uganda. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;p class="don-images d-block d-lg-none"&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;Public health response&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Local and national health authorities in Ethiopia implemented the following public health measures:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A National Taskforce established at the Ministry of Health to provide strategic guidance, make decisions and mobilize resources. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A costed national three-month response plan developed and launched by the MoH/EPHI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The MoH regularly disseminated information on the MVD outbreak to the public and key partners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Public Health Emergency Operational Centres were activated at national and regional levels, with incident management structures established to coordinate the response. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Ministry of Health, in collaboration with EPHI and regional health offices, conducted integrated surveillance and response activities, including at priority points of entry (PoEs) and points of control (PoCs). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Community surveillance, contact tracing, house-to-house visits, and medical service delivery were enhanced. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two hospitals designated as treatment centres, with dedicated health workers deployed to manage cases. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Laboratory capacities were strengthened both at national level and through the deployment of a mobile laboratory in Jinka for timely confirmation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Field assessments conducted by a rapid response team (RRT). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) teams disseminated MVD prevention messages, conducted community dialogues, developed activity plans for targeted community interventions, monitored social media to address misinformation, and assessed trusted communication channels to enhance public awareness and engage local networks and influencers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO, through its country office and partners, provided technical, operational and financial support to the government to contain this outbreak. These include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;WHO provided policy, technical and operational support across all response pillars, including on PoE surveillance, laboratory, case management, IPC, safe and dignified burial, RCCE, logistics and cross-border coordination. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provided emergency supplies including testing kits, VHF kits, treatment centre modules. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deployed technical experts to provide operational support across all response pillars. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provided technical support for capacity building and supervision on surveillance, integrated case management and IPC activities. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Continued providing technical and strategic support for the transition plan, including the integration of the MVD response into essential health services. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Supported the Regional Health Bureau (RHB) with community-based active case searching and mortality surveillance across various clusters. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provided technical and programmatic support to the RHB for the development and implementation of the Survivors Program. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;p class="don-images d-block d-lg-none"&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;WHO risk assessment&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This was the first-ever confirmed MVD outbreak reported in Ethiopia.  Based on the outbreak investigation and surveillance activities during the response, which included contact tracing, alert management, active case search, and mortality surveillance, no additional cases have been reported during the 42-day countdown period, as per WHO recommendations. However, there remains a risk of re-emergence of MVD following the declaration of the end of the outbreak, with potential spillovers from interactions with the animal reservoir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk communication and community engagement activities will continue to provide timely and accurate information, monitor and address community feedback and rumours, while supporting efforts to reduce stigma toward individuals affected by the outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;p class="don-images d-block d-lg-none"&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;WHO advice&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;WHO encourages maintaining early detection and care capacities in addition to sustaining the ability to quickly respond after the outbreak ends. This is to make sure that if the disease re-emerges, health authorities can detect it immediately, prevent the disease from spreading again, and ultimately save lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raising awareness of risk factors for MVD and protective measures that individuals can take is an effective way to reduce human transmission. WHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce MVD transmission in healthcare facilities and in communities:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Reducing the risk      of bat-to-human transmission arising from prolonged exposure to mines or      caves inhabited by fruit bat colonies. People visiting or working in mines      or caves inhabited by fruit bat colonies should wear gloves and other      appropriate protective clothing (including masks).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Capabilities for      early detection of MVD patients should be maintained over time in settings      at risk of the disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Reducing the risk      of human-to-human transmission in the community arising from direct or      close contact with infected patients, particularly with their body fluids.      Close physical contact with MVD patients should be avoided. Patients      suspected or confirmed for MVD should be isolated in a designated      treatment centre for early care and to avoid transmission at home.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Communities affected by MVD, along with health authorities, should ensure that the      population is well informed, both about the nature of the disease itself      and about necessary outbreak containment measures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Outbreak containment measures include safe and dignified burial of the deceased,      identifying people who may have been in contact with someone infected with      MVD and monitoring their health for 21 days and providing care to the      confirmed patient. Any sick people with symptoms matching MVD should be      referred to a health facility with adequate capacity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Critical infection      prevention and control measures should be implemented and/or strengthened      in all health care facilities, per &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-WPE-CRS-HCR-2023.1" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;WHO’s Infection prevention and control guideline      for Ebola and Marburg disease&lt;/a&gt;. Health workers caring for patients with confirmed or      suspected MVD should apply &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-UHL-IHS-IPC-2022.2" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;transmission-based precautions&lt;/a&gt; in addition to: &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-UHL-IHS-IPC-2022.1" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;standard precautions&lt;/a&gt;, including appropriate use of PPE and hand      hygiene according to the &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/integrated-health-services-(ihs)/infection-prevention-and-control/your-5-moments-for-hand-hygiene-poster.pdf?sfvrsn=83e2fb0e_21" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;WHO 5 moments&lt;/a&gt; to avoid contact with patient’s blood and      other body fluids and with contaminated surfaces and objects. Waste      generated in healthcare facilities must be safely segregated, collected,      transported, stored, treated and finally disposed. Follow the national      guidelines, rules and regulations for safe waste disposal or follow      the &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/85349/9789241548564_eng.pdf;sequence=1" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;WHO’s guidelines on safe waste management&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Patient-care activities should be undertaken in a clean and hygienic environment that      facilitates practices related to the prevention and control of      health-care-associated infections (HAIs) as outlined in &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241547239" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Essential environmental health standards in      health care&lt;/a&gt;. Safe water,      adequate sanitation and hygiene infrastructure and services should be      provided in healthcare facilities. For details on recommendations and      improvement, follow the &lt;a href="https://openwho.org/courses/wash-fit" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;WASH FIT implementation Package&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;WHO encourages      countries to implement a comprehensive care programme to support people      who have recovered from MVD with any subsequent sequelae and to enable      them to access body fluid testing and to mitigate the risk of transmission      through infected body fluids by adequate practices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the current risk assessment, WHO advises against any travel and trade restrictions with Ethiopia. &lt;/p&gt;

Those scenes shaped her view so much that she didn’t even realize many of her own symptoms – from &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2026/01/19/menopause-symptom-dry-eyes-naomi-watts/88162850007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;dry eyes&lt;/a&gt; to frozen shoulder – were signs that she was nearing menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Now at 57, Watts wants to change this narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Podcasters, &lt;a href="/story/entertainment/books/2026/01/12/melani-sanders-we-do-not-care-club-menopause-book/87705311007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;creators&lt;/a&gt;, comedians and writers are taking menopause conversations from taboo to mainstream. And Hollywood producers need to follow, Watts says. She is pushing for more stories that redefine midlife as a time of power, not decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“We need to see ourselves represented,” she tells USA TODAY. “Talking about menopause and showing our stories in movies can help women feel less alone.

She was shocked. After a struggle to get pregnant and a miscarriage, Watts went on to have two children one year apart. Then her menopause symptoms began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It was a lonely, scary time,” she remembers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Growing up in a time when there were two roles for women – romantic lead and grandma – Watts kept her menopause to herself. She worried that talking about it publicly would end her career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It took her more than 10 years to tell her menopause stories, becoming one of the first celebrities to do so widely. Many followed, from Drew Barrymore who shared that she was having a hot flash during an interview on her talk show in 2023 to &lt;a href="/story/entertainment/celebrities/2024/05/03/halle-berry-menopause-bill/73560451007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Halle Berry&lt;/a&gt; who joined U.S. senators at the Capitol last year to push for more money for menopause research and education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Watts cofounded Stripes, a menopause beauty and wellness brand, in 2022. The company sells everything from vitamins to vaginal cream. Her book, &lt;a href="/booklist/books/dare-i-say-it-everything-i-wish-id-known-about-menopause/9780593729038/2025-01-29" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;“Dare I Say It: Everything I Wish I Knew About Menopause,”&lt;/a&gt; which combined funny and relatable stories with expert advice, was published in 2025. (The book comes out in paperback in February.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I don’t want to be told it’s time to stop,” she says. “I have plenty more to say and do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Will menopause have its movie moment?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Has there been a movie in the past decade featuring a menopause story line?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Watts says it’s hard to think of one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;OK, how about TV?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There’s &lt;a href="/story/entertainment/tv/2025/07/31/leanne-morgan-netflix-tv-show/85191875007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;“Leeanne,”&lt;/a&gt; the sitcom from comedian Leeanne Morgan.

And we need to do better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;About 8 in 10 adults 18 and older say movies and TV shape how people see aging, according to a recent study from &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=83224X1595658&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aarp.org%2Fpri%2Ftopics%2Fsocial-leisure%2Factivities-interests%2Fage-diversity-movies-television%2F%3FCMP%3DRDRCT-PRI-ENT&amp;amp;xcust=USAT&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fentertainment%2Fmovies%2F2026%2F01%2F26%2Fnaomi-watts-menopause-movies%2F88162092007%2F" data-v-afl data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;AARP&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;WAUKESHA, Wis. — The &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/"&gt;Wisconsin Department of Health Services&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/news/releases/012626.htm"&gt;confirms the first case of measles&lt;/a&gt; in the Badger state this year in a resident in Waukesha County.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health officials at the state level and from the &lt;a href="https://www.waukeshacounty.gov/health-and-human-services/"&gt;Waukesha County Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; report the case is related to an adult traveling internationally, and are still working to identify and notify anyone who may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So far, they have not identified any locations where the general public may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, measles&lt;/a&gt; is a highly contagious disease that can spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and can linger in the air for up to two hours after the exposure. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is so contagious that if one person gets it, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/causes/index.html"&gt;up to 90% of the people around them may also become infected if they are not vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles typically appear approximately 10 to 21 days after an exposure, and include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Runny nose.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;High fever (may be greater than 104°F).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Tiredness.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Cough.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes, or conjunctivitis (“pink eye”).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A red rash with raised bumps that starts at the hairline and moves to the arms and legs three to five days after symptoms begin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Measles can cause serious health complications, including pneumonia, brain damage, and deafness, and can sometimes become deadly. One in four people who get measles in the United States will be hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health officials say the best prevention for measles is two doses of the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine (MMR), which is 97% effective at preventing the disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wisconsin residents can check if they are vaccinated through the Wisconsin Immunization &lt;a href="https://www.dhfswir.org/PR/logoff.do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Registry&lt;/a&gt; or contact their health care provider or local health department to see if they or their child has been vaccinated to protect against measles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="b8823f85-54d0-400e-8fd3-c8d24bbdfed7"&gt;Not all fat is created equal — while one type of fat in the body raises blood pressure, another helps keep it in check, a study in mice suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In people, excess body fat has long been tied to high blood pressure, or hypertension, and a number of other cardiovascular problems. But the body carries two types of fat: "brown" fat, which burns energy and helps keep the body warm, and "white" fat, which stores excess calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="b8823f85-54d0-400e-8fd3-c8d24bbdfed7-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;For a long time, it was thought that brown fat withers away after childhood, said senior study author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.rockefeller.edu/our-scientists/heads-of-laboratories/1112-paul-cohen/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.rockefeller.edu/our-scientists/heads-of-laboratories/1112-paul-cohen/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Paul Cohen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist and physician-scientist at The Rockefeller University in New York. However, about 15 years ago, it was discovered that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19357406/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19357406/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;adult humans retain some amount of brown fat&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which gets activated primarily by cold exposure. Moreover, Cohen has &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_4967410131609355462&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41591-020-1126-7&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fheart-circulation%2Fpeople-with-more-brown-fat-have-healthier-cardiovascular-systems-a-new-study-in-mice-may-explain-why" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1126-7" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-google-interstitial="false" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41591-020-1126-7&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fheart-circulation%2Fpeople-with-more-brown-fat-have-healthier-cardiovascular-systems-a-new-study-in-mice-may-explain-why" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;since shown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that higher levels of brown fat are linked to a lower prevalence of obesity and hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="125d18e8-3b3d-4678-8a85-257e505f3c2f"&gt;"We wanted to better understand how brown fat might do this," Cohen told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, in a new study published Jan. 15 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ady8644" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ady8644" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Science&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Cohen and his team showed that eliminating the gene that makes "beige" fat — the mouse equivalent of adult human brown fat — converted all the beige fat around blood vessels into white fat. This, in turn, caused mice to develop high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team traced the effect to an enzyme released by fat cells. Normally kept in check by beige fat cells, the enzyme's levels spiked when beige fat was converted into white fat, the study showed. This triggered excessive tightening of blood vessels and higher blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an important study that, for the first time, establishes how beige fat directly affects cardiovascular health, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://kazaklabmcgill.ca/contact-2/people-2/" target="_blank" data-url="https://kazaklabmcgill.ca/contact-2/people-2/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lawrence Kazak&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor at McGill University who studies the energy expenditure of brown fat and was not involved in the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-DSDERsx7jdwhWL6npgKJ3G" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-DSDERsx7jdwhWL6npgKJ3G slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's well documented that obesity influences blood pressure and cardiometabolic health on a system level, Kazak told Live Science. But this work highlights a "niche role" for beige fat and the mechanism behind its "local effects" on the blood vessels, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-4207e520-af08-4808-a5db-0302a6947bbc" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-fat-controls-blood-pressure-3"&gt;How fat controls blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="a79f9f53-7af4-4141-a9f1-76235d753f96"&gt;Cohen's team began their study by deleting the Prdm16 gene from the fat cells of lab mice, turning the beige fat around their blood vessels white. This gene is known to be highly active in beige fat, acting as a master regulator that helps them maintain an energy-burning function rather than becoming white fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This change was visible just by looking at the tissue, said first study author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cohenlab.rockefeller.edu/index.php/lab-members/" target="_blank" data-url="https://cohenlab.rockefeller.edu/index.php/lab-members/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mascha Koenen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral fellow at Cohen's lab. Beige-fat-laden tissue, which normally looks dusky and speckled with tiny droplets, turned pale, resembling ordinary white fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers observed that the animals that lacked beige fat also developed higher blood pressure, and their blood vessels became stiffer and accumulated more fibrous tissue, making it harder for them to relax as the blood surged through them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then treated the mice's blood vessels with a hormone called angiotensin II, which is known to raise blood pressure by tightening arteries, similar to how pinching a hose restricts the flow of water. Blood vessels from mice lacking beige fat constricted more strongly in response to the hormone, compared with vessels from normal mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify the mechanism behind this, the team sifted through molecular signals released by fat cells near the blood vessels and identified an enzyme called QSOX1. This enzyme stiffens the connective tissue around blood vessels and makes it harder for them to relax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, the protein encoded by the Prdm16 gene keeps the production of this enzyme in check. But without beige fat, the levels of QSOX1 surge, leading to stiff blood vessels and high blood pressure, the team concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the researchers found that deleting both beige fat and QSOX1 from mice prevented this chain reaction, and those mice did not develop high blood pressure, suggesting that QSOX1 is essential for driving this mechanism, they concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beige fat in mice and brown fat in humans are known for their heat production; they contain high numbers of mitochondria, which are the cells' energy factories and impart the tissue its brown color. However, Koenen noted that this heat-producing function is not related to the QSOX1 mechanism they identified. Their study instead highlights an additional role of beige fat as "secretory" cells, which release important proteins into the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="14a06a40-a05d-451e-be2c-e54f19c195aa"&gt;Even if the beige fat cells are small, "they can have this huge impact on whole body physiology," Koenen told Live Science. And the study could point to new ways of treating high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can imagine that molecules that can inhibit QSOX1 could be potentially therapeutically beneficial," Kazak suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen also believes that targeting QSOX1 could help scientists develop precision therapies for hypertension in the future. This would require them to first learn more about this mechanism in order to counter it, he noted. Nonetheless, the research points to a "pathway forward" for studying the effects of QSOX1 inhibitors in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="2039acc0-2506-4d6f-b455-9e03d5f9a562"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Peanuts do double duty in this easy snack recipe: peanut butter makes a creamy center while chopped roasted peanuts add a welcome crunch to the exterior. We prefer to use natural peanut butter, which is a little oilier and looser, to help create the gooey center. Dates add a natural sweetness to this healthy snack. Use any leftover date mixture to patch any holes in the energy balls. Pack these bites in your lunchbox for a tasty morning or afternoon snack.
&lt;/p&gt;

Baked in a mini muffin pan, they’re easy to portion, quick to cool and just right for snacking.
