At the other end of the scale, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/utah/index.html" id="mol-1e6727d0-4163-11f0-a2f2-495da05b30f4" class=""&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; had the lowest rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Chinmay Jani, the oncologist who led the study, warned alcohol could cause cancer because it was made from ethanol, which is broken down in the body into acetaldehyde — a known carcinogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His co-author Dr Gilberto Lopes, also an oncologist, said: 'Alcohol is a leading preventable [cancer] risk factor. It's not about prohibition, it's more about prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Increasing awareness and targeted policies will help us prevent multiple cancer cases and, therefore, reduce cancer mortality.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to how much a person drinks, cancer risks can also increase based on when a person drinks - with alcohol having a more profound effect on the body as people age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the study, the researchers analyzed data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project — a UN-backed database that tracks causes of death worldwide, including those linked to alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To estimate how many cancer deaths were caused by alcohol, the database used statistical models to calculate the number of deaths from cancer that were linked to alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Figures were converted into rates to allow for comparison between states and sexes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, among men, the team found the alcohol-associated cancer death rate was highest in Washington DC at 10 deaths per 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was followed by Texas, with a rate of 7.5, and Hawaii, with a rate of 7.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among women, Washington DC also had the highest rate of cancer deaths linked to alcohol — with 3.6 fatalities per 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Second was New Hampshire, at three, and third was Maryland, at 2.75.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DC may rank top because it is among the areas with the highest levels of binge drinking and heavy drinking in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2023 CDC study, for example, found that 27.2 percent of adults in the district reported binge drinking, outranking all states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is also home to the nation's capital and a high concentration of wealthy individuals and young professionals, who may more commonly indulge in an alcoholic beverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A young group of friends pictured enjoying a beverage (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the other end of the scale was Utah, which was found to have the lowest fatality rate from cancers estimated to have been caused by alcohol nationwide — among both men and women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is likely because it has a large population of Mormons — whose scripture prohibits the consumption of alcohol of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When you drink alcohol is also a risk factor for health complications. A night of heavy drinking at 51 is very different than at 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While experts say damage done from alcohol is cumulative over a lifetime, there are certain effects people will experience in each decade of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Middle age - around the ages of 35 to 50 years old - the health effects of drinking begin to emerge, including cancer, heart disease and liver disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In middle age, the body is less able to process alcohol, meaning it could linger in the body longer, doing more damage. Alcoholic beverages may also lead to more blood sugar issues the older a person is and worsen high blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People often begin taking medications in middle age, such as for cholesterol, blood pressure or heart function. Mixing these with alcohol can cause serious complications, including excessive or internal bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While experts advise it's best to never start drinking, the earlier you stop, the better.  &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, colon cancer proportionally saw the sharpest rise in alcohol-linked cancer deaths over the 30-year period — rising 32 percent from 4.92 to 6.5 alcohol-related cancer deaths per 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Esophageal cancer saw the second largest rise, up by 20.1 percent, while pharynx cancers saw the third highest rise, up by 18.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colon cancer cases are rising among young adults, with some suggesting this could be linked to alcohol consumption — although this is falling in younger age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies suggest that people who develop colon cancer may have a less diverse microbiome, with this raising the risk of inflammation, potentially raising the risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The esophagus and larynx come into direct contact with alcohol when someone drinks, which may raise the risk of the cancer, and the substance is broken down in the liver and passes through the colon, also raising the risk of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jani said: 'These state-by-state differences really highlight how much local culture, policy, and access to care shape outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What stood out was the rise in states like Tennessee and New Mexico, where previous studies have shown higher alcohol use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It reinforces the need for targeted awareness and interventions in these areas — starting local can pave the way for broader, national efforts.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Those aged between 35 and 54 maintained a higher drinking rate, at 69 percent. Between 2001 and 2003, 67 percent of this age group said they were drinking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study also found that cancer-related alcohol deaths were rising among men, but falling among women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It estimated over the study period, these rose by 10 percent in men — but declined 14 percent in women. Overall, women accounted for a much lower proportion of deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Surveys suggest that 62 percent of Americans drink alcohol, while 38 percent say they abstain completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among drinkers, the average American consumes about 2.83 gallons of pure alcohol per year — equivalent to about 600 cocktails or pints of beer per year. Sixty-nine percent say they consumed alcohol within the last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Estimates suggest about 61.4million people aged 12 and up binge drink, defined as drinking four or more drinks on an occasion for women, and five or more for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2021, liver cancer caused by alcohol was linked to 7,408 deaths every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the same year, colon cancer was linked to 4,687 deaths, while esophageal cancers were linked to 3,948 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also detected that alcohol-linked deaths were rising faster among over-50s, surging by 16 percent compared to 7.8 percent among younger adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This didn't include deaths in accidents or car crashes that may also be linked to alcohol consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For decades, studies suggested there was some benefit to drinking moderate amounts of alcohol, which was thought to be linked to its destressing effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in recent years, research has swung the other way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many studies have since shown that consuming alcohol in any amount raises the risk of everything from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-484453f0-b3fd-11ef-a1d9-b1aecd0ad34e" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; to heart disease, liver disease and high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US is currently considering its new dietary guidelines, which will set a recommended level for alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Current guidelines state that men should not consume more than two alcoholic drinks per day, while women should not consume more than one a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not clear what the new guidelines may recommend, with recent reports suggesting the Trump administration is considering shelving the document entirely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A compound found in donkey skin could be the key to keeping ticks—and the diseases they carry—at bay, according to new research from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Scientists say this natural solution rivals traditional repellents and might offer safer protection for people and pets. People usually rely on chemical tick repellents like DEET and permethrin, but "there is a strong public desire for natural' means of killing and repelling ticks," UMass Amherst microbiologist Stephen Rich tells &lt;a href="https://phys.org/news/2025-06-donkey-skin-secretion-repels-deer.html"&gt;Phys.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        The new study published in &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0317975"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and co-authored by four high school students who designed and ran key experiments as part of a 2023 summer program, highlights a compound known as (E)-2-octenal, which is secreted by the skin of donkeys. This substance appears to effectively drive away adult deer ticks, the most frequent tick-biting species in the US, known to spread bacterial infections including Lyme disease.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        The research team, led by doctoral student Eric Siegel, discovered compounds in donkey skin make their scent unappealing to ticks and that ticks that feed off horses, but not donkeys, are repelled by the compound when it is applied to horses, per &lt;a href="https://www.masslive.com/news/2025/06/donkey-skin-as-tick-repellent-mass-researchers-say-it-could-be-more-effective-than-deet.html"&gt;MassLive&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, octenal was shown in lab tests to be as good or better than DEET at repelling ticks, and worked particularly well against males. The team is now working to develop a tick repellent for people and pets that takes advantage of this natural compound.  (This content was created with the help of AI.

From 2012 to 2021 — the most recent decade of data — the rate &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/breast-cancer-facts-and-figures/2024/breast-cancer-facts-and-figures-2024.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;increased 1.4% annually in women under 50&lt;/a&gt;, compared with 0.7% annually in women 50 and up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-48cec5" class="body-graf"&gt;The trend applies to all racial or ethnic groups, particularly Asian American and Pacific Islander women under 50, for whom &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statistics-network/explorer/application.html?site=55&amp;amp;data_type=1&amp;amp;graph_type=2&amp;amp;compareBy=race&amp;amp;chk_race_4=4&amp;amp;rate_type=2&amp;amp;sex=3&amp;amp;age_range=9&amp;amp;stage=101&amp;amp;advopt_precision=1&amp;amp;advopt_show_ci=on&amp;amp;hdn_view=0&amp;amp;advopt_show_apc=on&amp;amp;advopt_display=2" target="_blank"&gt;diagnoses have risen nearly 50%&lt;/a&gt; since 2000.

In that case, the American Cancer Society recommends mammograms starting at age 30, plus an annual breast MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-75aca7" class="body-graf"&gt;Several breast cancer doctors said younger patients and their clinicians should be careful not to dismiss symptoms such as a lump or nipple discharge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5909a7" class="body-graf"&gt;“The thought was always, if you had a change in your breast but you were a young woman, it was probably nothing,” said Dr. Rani Bansal, an assistant professor at the Duke University School of Medicine. “As we’re seeing more and more younger women get diagnosed … we need to take these cases seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7b92f8" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Oluwadamilola Fayanju, chief of breast surgery at Penn Medicine, said her youngest patient diagnosed with cancer was just 17. She recommended that young women with symptoms go to a center that’s experienced in breast imaging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cbb2d4" class="body-graf"&gt;For women with an elevated risk of breast cancer, she said, “it may be better for you to be connected with a dedicated breast provider who can keep a close eye on you and do regular exams even well before 40.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-5ff58a" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breast cancer in young women is often more aggressive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1c6eba" class="body-graf"&gt;As treatment options for breast cancer have improved, the overall mortality rate among younger women with the disease &lt;a href="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/20273/presentation/6661" target="_blank"&gt;declined from 2010 to 2020&lt;/a&gt;, according to research presented in April at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c18a80" class="body-graf"&gt;But young women are still more likely to be diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer compared with older women. One reason could be that they’re not getting screened as much, so it’s harder to catch cases early. Young women are also more likely to be diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer, which tends to spread fast and has fewer treatment options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-254a3a" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Virginia Borges, a professor of medical oncology at the University of Colorado Cancer Center, said all women diagnosed with breast cancer before age 35 have a higher likelihood of the cancer spreading to the rest of their bodies, for reasons doctors don’t fully understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-81aec6" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s like this great big puzzle of all these different factors that can contribute to why we see these cancers behave the way they do,” Borges said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4b4cba" class="body-graf"&gt;Bansal said doctors are hoping to learn more about which treatments are better suited to women under 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d2e09e" class="body-graf"&gt;“We need more data to better tailor our treatments towards younger women,” she said. “A lot of the studies that are done are in older women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-118352" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle, environment, hormones&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-59fbfa" class="body-graf"&gt;There are several mysteries as to why younger women are diagnosed with breast cancer at higher rates. Doctors generally agree that multiple factors are at play, including lifestyle, hormones and environmental exposures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-87e6ca" class="body-graf"&gt;Diets high in ultra-processed foods or a lack of physical activity can lead to obesity, which in turn elevates one’s cancer risk. Women in their 30s and 40s have also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7293936/" target="_blank"&gt;increased their alcohol consumption in recent decades&lt;/a&gt;, and drinking alcohol is linked to breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8e3f2b" class="body-graf"&gt;Exposure to environmental toxins such as air pollution, forever chemicals or microplastics could also play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b17caf" class="body-graf"&gt;“By the time women now in their 40s were babies, every single baby bottle had BPA. Everyone had Teflon pans in their home. Everyone was spraying Scotchgard around their home,” said Suzanne Price, CEO of Breast Cancer Prevention Partners, a nonprofit that works to eliminate exposure to toxic chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5ae927" class="body-graf"&gt;Several researchers said more data is needed to definitively draw that link. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d24c6c" class="body-graf"&gt;“Hopefully within the next few years, we should be having more insight into how those early life exposures drive the risk of breast cancer,” said Dr. Adetunji Toriola, a professor of surgery at Washington University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-323003" class="body-graf"&gt;Some studies have suggested that chemical hair straighteners, which are predominantly used by Black women, may be associated with &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ijc.32738" target="_blank"&gt;an increased risk of breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Fayanju said the straighteners “can potentially have effects on our ability to process hormones in our body and how those hormones then interact with cells in our breasts, which have receptors for those hormones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9108e3" class="body-graf"&gt;Changes in women’s reproductive lives might have some effect as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a1ee15" class="body-graf"&gt;Girls in the U.S. are &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2819141" target="_blank"&gt;starting their periods slightly earlier in life&lt;/a&gt; compared with decades ago. That may increase the length of time in which they’re exposed to higher levels of estrogen — a hormone that in some cases can feed cancer cells. A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2814306" target="_blank"&gt;study last year&lt;/a&gt; found an increase in the number of women ages 20 to 49 diagnosed with breast cancer that was responsive to estrogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-103109" class="body-graf"&gt;Many &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/fertility-rate-was-stable-2024-still-record-lows-rcna202657" target="_blank"&gt;women are also delaying childbirth until their 30s and 40s&lt;/a&gt;, which increases the risk of postpartum breast cancer — cancers that occur within five to 10 years of giving birth that appear to be linked to changes in the breasts during that time. Borges estimated that there are about 18,000 new cases of postpartum breast cancer each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ed2c47" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“How do you get from the millions of women who are having children without ending up with one of these breast cancers to the 18,000 or so who are going to get one of these breast cancers?” she said. “We’re still working on figuring that out. Age is important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 11:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixAFBVV95cUxPaDE2NGFyYkZGUmMtNVpJRTg4TW5wNUhtU0x6TkQ1U05BT2FzSnE4cUNxWWRoYS1xOERCRDdhV3pvYm9EMldjNHFBNnhKaGxUeDEzVVNrY2k3TG9BZ3Rqc1NlTS1qVDUxcUZiSl9aWGN1eGV2blZXVkpxbWZMVDNLR0RqcGMxQzRYc1UzbVhqY1NIanpsMFBkdW5VUFFUSFk1S0w4QWVDMkNmc0dRQ1g2ZnROaVdYeWY4YTVTWlRJSVNsSG100gFWQVVfeXFMTTNRbklDYjJkXzJhVldEVGpQVHQ1Z3NSNFotd09HNVphZVZTaUU5eVhQQ012X2E2VEdma25uZVIxb2RuRVFTZHR4NTNEMTJoTGdVRHJfQ2c</guid></item><item><title>膝盖医生说你永远不应该做的8件事- HuffPost | 8 Things Knee Doctors Say You Should Never, Ever Do - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often forget what a big role knees play in mobility and everyday life ― until they start to hurt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knee pain and injuries are fairly common, especially as we age. And although knee replacements can be a big help to people dealing with serious mobility issues, it would be nice to avoid needing major surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is there are many ways to help prevent injury and keep our knees healthy and strong as we age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;HuffPost asked orthopedic surgeons ― the doctors who know knees inside and out ― to share the things they never do in the interest of their knee health. Read on for the behaviors they avoid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They don’t jump into high-impact exercise after prolonged inactivity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One mistake people make is diving into exercise too quickly and going from zero to 100,” said &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1740484526/eric-l-grossman" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Eric Grossman" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6841d643e4b0a8e2861b36e2" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1740484526/eric-l-grossman" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;Dr. Eric Grossman&lt;/a&gt;, an orthopedic surgeon with NYU Langone Health. “If someone is new to exercise, they haven’t built up their tolerance, so trying to do too much at first can lead to injuries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recommended easing into more intense workouts. If you want to get into running, for instance, consider starting with slow, short jogs on softer surfaces rather than immediately trying to put in a half-marathon on concrete. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Never commence a high-impact, high-stress exercise regimen after prolonged periods of inactivity,” said &lt;a href="https://www.orlandohealth.com/physician-finder/daniel-miller-md#/overview" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Daniel Miller" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6841d643e4b0a8e2861b36e2" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.orlandohealth.com/physician-finder/daniel-miller-md#/overview" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Dr. Daniel Miller&lt;/a&gt;, an orthopedic surgeon at the Orlando Health Jewett Orthopedic Institute. “There are a lot of new exercise regimens and workout fads that offer quick results with strenuous routines. Allow your body time to acclimate and gradually increase your activity level. You will be more likely to avoid injury, as well as continue with your new regimen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They don’t ignore pain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pain is how your body tells you something is wrong,” Miller said. “If you ignore pain or just think you can work out through an injury, you are likely to continue suffering with discomfort. By ‘pushing through’ pain, you are also more likely to exacerbate your current injury as well as exposing yourself to the possibility of subsequent damage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s normal to feel a little sore or achy after a workout, but sudden sharp pains, swelling or restrictions in your movement can be a sign of something more serious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pain in the knee may be a result of an injury to one of the structures inside the knee, such as a tear of the meniscus or an injury to a ligament such as the ACL,” said Dr. Struan Coleman, an orthopedic surgeon at the Hospital of Special Surgery in New York City and co-founder of &lt;a href="https://mymotive.com/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Motive Health" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6841d643e4b0a8e2861b36e2" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://mymotive.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Motive Health&lt;/a&gt;. “Knee pain can also be a sign that the cartilage is being overloaded and is starting to wear down, resulting in early arthritis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;An evaluation and diagnosis from a physician can bring relief from your discomfort and help you avoid long-lasting complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One should always seek the advice of a medical professional who will perform an exam and most likely obtain an X-ray and possibly an MRI,” Coleman added. “Once a diagnosis is made, then the appropriate treatment plan can be initiated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They don’t skip warmups.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before beginning a workout or playing sports, it’s crucial to take some time to properly warm up your body with stretching and light exercises. This will better equip your muscles and joints to handle the strain of the exercise and maximize the benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dynamic stretching and warmups before exercise help bring blood flow to muscles and reduces risk of knee injury,” said &lt;a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/shawn-g-anthony" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Shawn Anthony" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6841d643e4b0a8e2861b36e2" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/shawn-g-anthony" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Dr. Shawn Anthony&lt;/a&gt;, the associate chief of sports medicine at Mount Sinai Health System and The Orthopedic Center at Mount Sinai West. “This can include lunges, jumping jacks or running in place. Dynamic stretches have been shown to be better than static stretching.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They don’t avoid opportunities for better nutrition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A healthy diet rich in antioxidants and vitamins promotes joint health,” Anthony said. “Staying a healthy body weight also reduces stress on the knee joints that can worsen pain from knee injuries and osteoarthritis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to potentially reducing stress on your joints, eating nutritious foods can also improve longevity and help your body cope with other health challenges. The doctors who spoke to HuffPost recommended speaking to a nutrition specialist to determine what approach is best for you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Maintaining ideal weight can be very challenging for patients with knee arthritis, as knee pain often results in a patient becoming less active,” Coleman said. “It is extremely important to work with your health care provider to design a good nutrition and exercise program in order to maintain optimal body weight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Proper form and warmups before exercise are crucial in preventing knee pain.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They don’t exercise without proper form. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Never exercise or weightlift without proper mechanics,” Anthony said. “One of the most common reason for injuries is poor mechanics when lifting weights.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using proper form is an important consideration to avoid straining, tearing or spraining your muscles, joints and ligaments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is especially common among those just starting to work out,” Anthony added. “It is always best to have guidance from an athletic trainer who can demonstrate and watch for proper form and reduce risk for injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They don’t frequently kneel on hard surfaces with no cushion. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s wise to avoid kneeling frequently and for long durations without any cushioning,” said Dr. Leon E.

So, of course, it’s best to avoid direct trauma to the knee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They don’t stick to only one type of physical activity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Never underestimate the importance of playing multiple different sports or rotating exercises and activities,” Anthony said. “Overuse injuries make the number one reason for knee problems.

Stay in motion and keep those muscles strong, and if walking is painful, switch to the stationary bike or elliptical, or try swimming.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 11:00:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxORHROblBQcjhQenMwaU5EVndsMDd6WENMSlZpQXV5ZTBQNGc3UnUxaFF4dzVsazRzSnh4UDBIc2xaQnpicXZoMUhlTWJKZEtzMWg3WExsMTBNRHVLakQyeWkzZWhVdThnNlJCdDdIOWM5dDlIbDZhZE9pSUw4QTZEQjZtc2NMTFBGX1VucldDZDRfWVdFQ1FFbUJTcko4Z1lBRm9lMTExeUQxTjkzMkRJUGdoQdIBuAFBVV95cUxQZ1pGUHlwWm5iaDBUaXJBV2NnSFV3MDB1bzVyQWZSVmM4eHRndnA3djdtY2lWVFc1UUgtUUF6Vk9wM010cVF5dXVVbC02Q0F6WVVkb3EzbDRwV3lxNTdqa0VrVGVqQTRmcmVtUUZXeU11OTNDNE9nZUktdFVrTTloSk90bVJ0MWMtZ3VyTEJMemIyMWpoY2F2VVpKb3lwVnFURmoyWEp3ZFlEVHJtMjcxQU5ja05QSTJj</guid></item><item><title>不仅仅是成瘾：屏幕和社交媒体如何重塑我们的思维- Ynetnews | More than addiction: How screens and social media reshape our minds - Ynetnews</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYkFVX3lxTFBrTVJOdkJONkRVcUdFeXR5VWJXV0xDcnpwVlF2VGlDMkFYcV9sU0JIUUFZRUpNTUl1OEduRjZiZ2FzbXE0d0V4QXRqVHkza21SQ3VYQmVsa0NodVlvTkplaVVB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-contents="true"&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="c4io4" data-offset-key="81kqk-0-0"&gt;&lt;div data-offset-key="81kqk-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="81kqk-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;In today’s world, it’s nearly impossible to avoid screens.

Screens provide artificial stimulation that floods the brain and doesn’t allow it to develop the capacity to tolerate boredom or process subtle cues.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="c4io4" data-offset-key="41hjj-0-0"&gt;&lt;div data-offset-key="41hjj-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="41hjj-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Treitel warned that, when young children become used to the fast-paced, highly stimulating content on screens, their &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a id="BJT8C4efX7eg" href="https://www.ynetnews.com/health_science/article/hk1rva6rjx" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="41hjj-1-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;nervous systems struggle to adjust to real-life situations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="41hjj-2-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;. “They enter classrooms expecting the same kind of excitement they get from a screen. When they don’t get it, they disengage. That’s when we start to see attention disorders.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="c4io4" data-offset-key="f00q-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="f00q-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="f00q-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;According to Treitel, the dopamine surges children receive from digital content alter the reward system in the brain. “Screens program the brain to seek fast and frequent rewards. Real-life learning doesn’t work like that—it’s often slow, cumulative and requires effort. But when kids get used to being rewarded instantly, they lose motivation for slower, more meaningful tasks.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="c4io4" data-offset-key="22us6-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="22us6-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="22us6-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;She also pointed to a growing emotional gap in children raised on screens: “Kids are struggling to identify and process emotions. When you don’t look someone in the eye or read their facial expressions—because you’re staring at a screen—you don’t develop empathy in the same way. And later, that can manifest in trouble connecting with others.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="c4io4" data-offset-key="bdhsb-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.BJe7u3hGXgx" id="image_ArticleImageData.BJe7u3hGXgx"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.BJe7u3hGXgx" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/06/03/Sy7MBOhGex/Sy7MBOhGex_1_0_1080_607_0_x-large.jpg" alt="חוה טרייטל" title="Chava Treitel: Early and prolonged exposure to screens interferes with how the brain develops  (Photo: Avi Ikon) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="mobileView"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.BJe7u3hGXgx" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/06/03/Sy7MBOhGex/Sy7MBOhGex_1_0_1080_607_0_x-large.jpg" alt="חוה טרייטל" title="Chava Treitel: Early and prolonged exposure to screens interferes with how the brain develops  (Photo: Avi Ikon) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="ImageDetails"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCaption"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Chava Treitel: Early and prolonged exposure to screens interferes with how the brain develops &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCredit"&gt;(&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Photo: Avi Ikon&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="c4io4" data-offset-key="67l54-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="67l54-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="67l54-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Beyond the cognitive and emotional impacts, excessive screen time is taking a toll on physical health. “Children today are moving less and that’s a real problem,” Treitel warned. “We’re seeing more cases of muscle weakness, delayed motor development, scoliosis and even eating disorders in children and teens who spend hours on screens.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="c4io4" data-offset-key="187di-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="187di-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="187di-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Poor posture while hunched over smartphones, combined with a lack of physical activity, contributes to a host of musculoskeletal issues. “The human body wasn’t built to sit still and stare downward all day,” she said. “Movement is essential for healthy development—and not just for the body. Movement also regulates mood, supports learning and strengthens neural connections.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="c4io4" data-offset-key="74i5g-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="74i5g-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="74i5g-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Treitel stressed that not all screens are created equal. “TV and digital media don’t have the same effect. Television forces you to sit through a relatively long narrative that you didn’t choose, which requires attention and patience. Digital media, on the other hand, gives you total control—you can skip, scroll and jump to the next thing instantly. That rewires the brain to expect novelty every few seconds.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="c4io4" data-offset-key="9f2hf-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="9f2hf-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="9f2hf-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The result, she said, is a significant reduction in our ability to concentrate for extended periods. “And without sustained attention, we can’t engage in deep thinking. That’s a serious problem for learning and emotional regulation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="c4io4" data-offset-key="dfsr0-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="dfsr0-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="dfsr0-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The digital age has also introduced a surprising new fear: boredom. “That’s something we didn’t see before the 2000s,” said Treitel. “In the past, kids knew how to entertain themselves using imagination. Between the ages of two and seven, that’s a critical skill to develop—but today’s kids often don’t get the chance to practice it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="c4io4" data-offset-key="8e0et-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="c4io4" data-offset-key="csvpj-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="csvpj-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="csvpj-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Even adults are affected. “When you used to go on long drives, you’d daydream or reflect. Now we fill every gap with our phones. That shift damages our ability to engage with our own thoughts and we become reliant on external stimulation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="c4io4" data-offset-key="bgfgb-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="bgfgb-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="bgfgb-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“The effect of screens on sleep is enormous,” Treitel warned. “Studies consistently show that using screens before bed reduces sleep quality—especially in teens. There are two main reasons: the blue light emitted by screens interferes with the body’s natural melatonin production, and the brain needs time before sleep to process the day’s experiences.

The researchers used both observational and genetic approaches to better understand whether these associations might be causal. While most associations were small, the results offer compelling support for the idea that chronic low-grade inflammation can influence emotional well-being and mental performance. The findings were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-025-03372-w" target="_blank"&gt;Translational Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression is one of the most common and disabling mental health conditions worldwide. It is often accompanied by problems with memory, attention, and decision-making. These cognitive issues are not just minor symptoms—they contribute to long-term disability and reduced quality of life. However, current treatments for depression and cognitive symptoms are often only modestly effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hypothesis gaining traction is that inflammation, particularly low-level systemic inflammation, may underlie some cases of depression and related cognitive problems. Inflammation is the body’s natural response to infection or injury, but when it becomes chronic, it can begin to interfere with brain function. Previous studies have shown that people with depression tend to have higher levels of inflammatory proteins like interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein in their blood. But whether these proteins cause depression or are simply a byproduct of poor health is not yet settled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is growing evidence that some individuals develop depression because of underlying immune dysfunction. Evaluating this scientifically is hard because there are many factors that are associated with both depression and immune dysfunction (substance use, poor diet, stress, adiposity), which makes disentangling causal relationships challenging,” said study author Naoise Mac Giollabhui, an assistant professor and clinical psychologist at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This paper was an opportunity to explore the association between inflammatory biomarkers and a range of mental health outcomes using a very large Dutch cohort study and to use an approach that would allow us to probe whether some specific immune biomarkers are causally linked with specific mental health outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study used data from the Lifelines cohort, a large, population-based study in the Netherlands that follows tens of thousands of individuals over time. More than 55,000 adults took part in the observational portion of the study, which examined levels of C-reactive protein in the blood, as well as symptoms of depression, anxiety, and performance on cognitive tests. Additionally, genetic data were available for over 57,000 participants, allowing the researchers to calculate genetic scores linked to several inflammatory markers, including interleukin-6, its receptor, and a compound known as GlycA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers first examined whether levels of C-reactive protein were associated with mental health symptoms and cognitive functioning. They found that higher levels of this immune marker were linked to an increased likelihood of depression, lower positive affect, higher negative affect, and slightly worse performance on tasks measuring executive functioning, attention, and psychomotor speed. These associations were statistically significant even after adjusting for important factors like age, body mass index, and existing health conditions, although the size of the effects was relatively small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the team looked at whether individuals with a genetic predisposition to higher inflammation also showed greater risk for mental health symptoms. They calculated genetic risk scores based on known variants that influence inflammation-related proteins. Here, they found that individuals with a higher genetic tendency toward elevated C-reactive protein or GlycA were more likely to experience negative affect and, in some cases, to meet criteria for depression or anxiety disorders. For example, the genetic score related to C-reactive protein was associated with a higher risk of anxiety, while the score for GlycA was tied to a higher risk of major depressive disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, most of the genetic risk scores were not linked to cognitive outcomes, with one exception. Individuals with genetic variants associated with higher levels of soluble interleukin-6 receptor—a key component of the immune system’s signaling pathways—showed slightly poorer memory performance. This finding suggests a possible role for specific inflammatory pathways in memory function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third method the researchers used was Mendelian randomization, which helps infer whether a factor like inflammation could be causing certain outcomes rather than merely being correlated with them. This method leverages the random inheritance of genetic traits to minimize confounding variables. Using this approach, the researchers found some tentative evidence that elevated C-reactive protein might causally increase the risk for anxiety. However, the association was just short of statistical significance, suggesting the need for more studies to confirm this result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most consistent findings across all methods was the link between inflammation—especially C-reactive protein—and negative affect. This refers to a general tendency to experience unpleasant emotions like anger, sadness, or fear. The fact that both measured inflammation and genetic risk for inflammation were tied to negative affect adds weight to the idea that immune system activity may influence emotional states beyond traditional diagnostic categories like depression or anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the results support the idea that inflammation contributes to psychological symptoms, the authors emphasize that the effects observed were small in size. They suggest that inflammation may play a role in a subset of individuals or in specific types of symptoms, such as anhedonia, fatigue, or irritability. These symptoms have been previously linked to immune system activity and may define a distinct subtype of depression with biological underpinnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also adds to a growing body of research suggesting that inflammatory pathways may be more important for understanding emotional well-being than for understanding cognitive performance. The limited associations between inflammation and cognitive test outcomes, especially in the genetic analyses, imply that any cognitive effects of inflammation may be more subtle or context-dependent. However, the one notable exception involving interleukin-6 signaling and memory highlights the need for more research into specific immune pathways and their cognitive effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings found fairly consistent associations between an immune marker measured in blood and depression, anxiety, cognitive abilities, and negative affect,” Mac Giollabhui told PsyPost. “We also found some evidence that genetic predisposition towards higher levels of immune markers were related to depression, anxiety, memory, and negative affect, suggesting these associations may be causal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as with any study, there are limitations. The sample was largely made up of individuals of European descent, which may limit how broadly the results can be applied. “More work is needed to determine whether these results generalize to other groups,” Mac Giollabhui said. “Second, the impact of genetics as operationalized in this study on our biomarkers was pretty modest in size and it’s hard to know whether larger increases in immune biomarkers might have a cumulative and potentially greater effect on the outcomes we were looking at.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study focused on associations in the general population, which overall showed small associations between immune markers and mental health outcomes. Future studies are needed to replicate these findings and to focus on specific sub-groups and life stages (e.g., older populations),” added co-author Chloe Slaney, a senior research associate at the University of Bristol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the findings provide new evidence that inflammation may play a small but measurable role in shaping emotional experiences and mental health risk. Importantly, the consistency of results across different types of analyses strengthens confidence in the idea that immune activity contributes to certain psychological traits and symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The long-term goal is to better understand the role that immune dysfunction plays in depression in order to identify treatment targets,” Mac Giollabhui explained. “I am currently running a mechanistic clinical trial that examines whether experimental inhibition of immune signaling in depressed individuals with high levels of inflammation leads to change in mood and cognition as well as the underlying immune-based mechanisms. There are a lot of investigators world-wide who are currently working on this bigger question. I hope that we can harness this information to develop new and more effective treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-025-03372-w" target="_blank"&gt;Role of inflammation in depressive and anxiety disorders, affect, and cognition: genetic and non-genetic findings in the lifelines cohort study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Naoise Mac Giollabhui, Chloe Slaney, Gibran Hemani, Éimear M.

I started with a few squats and lunges, followed by a gentle warm-up walk for six minutes and repeated this again for the cool-down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the main walk, I aimed to get my heart rate up and stay in the cardio zone (according to my Fitbit), so I increased both the incline and the speed on the treadmill and got moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="i-preferred-the-outdoors-to-the-treadmill-3"&gt;I preferred the outdoors to the treadmill&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: SolStock / Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won’t lie—I found walking on a treadmill for over 60 minutes boring. Music—an upbeat playlist featuring plenty of Beyoncé—kept me going, but by Saturday I’d had enough of staring at the walls of my gym, so I went for a walk outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swapping the gym for the great outdoors made all the difference, and on the final day I tacked the last of the challenge onto a 15km nature hike, which was the perfect way to finish strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-set-time-was-a-curse-and-a-blessing-3"&gt;A set time was a curse and a blessing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took serious planning to leave my desk and make it to the gym by 6pm every day. However, it did help me stay consistent and on reflection was a great way to close out the working day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A walk at 6pm on the weekends didn’t make sense with my schedule and I’m not an early riser, so on my weekend nature walks I made sure I was out of the door and moving by 9am rather than 6am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="my-step-count-exploded-3"&gt;My step count exploded&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My daily step count skyrocketed during the challenge. I exceeded my daily step count target of 10,000 steps, averaging 15,000 a day over the week, and even hitting as high as 24,000 on one of my longer weekend nature walks. This gave me a solid foundation to start my training for the charity hike the following week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s worth saying that making large jumps in the number of steps you take every day comes with risks. Your body may not be able to cope with the extra stress you place on it, so you should approach this challenge with caution if you don’t exercise regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="i-won-t-stick-with-it-3"&gt;I won’t stick with it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re already active and looking for a challenge to build momentum, the 6-6-6 routine is a great place to start, although it’s unlikely to be suitable for beginners, who should look to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/how-do-you-increase-your-step-count-safely-an-exercise-physiologist-weighs-in" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/how-do-you-increase-your-step-count-safely-an-exercise-physiologist-weighs-in"&gt;increase their step count safely&lt;/a&gt; with small, incremental increases each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, taking on this challenge week in, week out wouldn’t be sustainable for me, either, and would take time away from the other workouts I enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I missed my usual gym program, and by day five I was completely done with spending 60-plus minutes on a treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll be sticking to the 30-minute 12-3-30 routine when I’m on the treadmill, and walking outdoors in nature as much as I can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-shop-walking-shoes"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shop walking shoes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're in need of a new pair of walking shoes, our guide to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/buying-guides/best-shoes-for-walking" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/buying-guides/best-shoes-for-walking"&gt;best walking shoes&lt;/a&gt; can help.

But if even one or two of these signs are showing up consistently, it’s worth getting your kidneys checked with a simple blood or urine test.&lt;br&gt;Also, women are more prone to urinary tract infections (UTIs), which — if left untreated — can damage the kidneys over time. So it’s especially important to not ignore repeated UTIs or lower back pain.&lt;br&gt;Taking care of your kidneys isn’t complicated — stay hydrated, keep your blood pressure and blood sugar in check, eat clean, and move your body regularly. And above all, trust your gut. If something feels off, follow up on it.&lt;br&gt;Because your kidneys might be quiet workers, but when they’re in trouble, they do speak up — you just have to be willing to listen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 03:51:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>根据健康专家的说法，胰岛素抵抗的头号蛋白质- EatingWell | The #1 Protein for Insulin Resistance, According to Health Experts - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE9NbnNqcDFkRk9ydm1xY3o4eHNqT0V3b2R0TWxsMnhyNWdHNEx6LUVqU1VTbGZ1Y05WSUFuQ21uYU1aS1RxZ3pkM2NxUUNZVjlFNzF1azY0MTdRNlZNcFBlczBFZVBhRm1OcmRoSzBhNGdBMm9RbGt0T1BkYw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein helps stabilize blood sugar levels and plays an important role in insulin sensitivity. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tempeh is one of the best protein sources for insulin resistance. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tempeh is a versatile complete protein that provides probiotics, fiber and antioxidants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to protein foods, meat often gets placed on a pedestal. But if you're trying to reduce &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-have-insulin-resistance-8400321" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt; and support long-term metabolic health, plant proteins deserve to be right up there with their animal counterparts. According to health experts, tempeh—a fermented soy product—is the #1 protein for insulin resistance, though they note that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-protein-benefits-11712145" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;plant-based proteins&lt;/a&gt; in general are beneficial for improving insulin sensitivity, reducing inflammation and supporting stable blood sugar levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein, especially when consumed with fiber, helps regulate hormones that affect blood sugar levels. Levin explains that protein stimulates incretin hormones like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/glp-1-friendly-label-8766055" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;GLP-1&lt;/a&gt;, which boosts insulin secretion, helps you feel full and supports proper insulin function.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tempeh is made from whole soybeans and undergoes fermentation, which enhances its digestibility and nutrient profile. “Fermented soy foods provide antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic benefits,” says Dr. Malhotra. Unlike many animal proteins, tempeh also contains fiber and prebiotics that support gut health and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7890254/ways-to-improve-your-gut-health-when-you-have-diabetes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protect against insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tempeh can be steamed, marinated, sautéed or baked, making it an easy swap for meat in a variety of dishes. Its neutral flavor absorbs whatever seasoning you use, from bold stir-fry sauces to smoky taco seasonings.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291111/the-10-best-vegan-protein-sources/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;incorporating more plant-based proteins&lt;/a&gt; into your diet, tempeh is a standout—not just for its health perks, but for how easy it is to use in everyday meals. Levin recommends starting with simple swaps. “Tempeh can be sliced, marinated and baked for sandwiches, or crumbled into chili and tacos,” she says. Steaming it first helps reduce bitterness and allows it to absorb flavor better, she adds. Malhotra also encourages experimenting with different preparation methods to find what you enjoy. “Try marinating tempeh with your favorite seasonings.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are a few additional strategies from Malhotra and Levin:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add to Grain Bowls&lt;/strong&gt;: Toss roasted tempeh or lentils into a bowl with farro, greens and tahini dressing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upgrade Your Sandwich&lt;/strong&gt;: Use baked tempeh or marinated tofu in a TLT (tempeh, lettuce, tomato) or try a vegan banh mi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stir Into Stir-Fries&lt;/strong&gt;: Add tofu, tempeh or edamame to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/19377/cooking-methods-styles/stir-fry/vegetables/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;your favorite veggie stir-fries&lt;/a&gt; for a satisfying protein boost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crumble Into Chili or Tacos&lt;/strong&gt;: Try crumbled tempeh or lentils in place of meat in chilis, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/254609/chipotle-chicken-quinoa-burrito-bowl/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;burrito bowls&lt;/a&gt; or tacos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Over a Meaty Classic&lt;/strong&gt;: Make a vegetarian version of the viral Marry Me Chicken using tempeh or combine lentils, walnuts and mushrooms for a “meaty” veggie burger. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Improving insulin sensitivity isn’t just about what’s on your plate—your daily habits matter too. In addition to eating more plant-based proteins, these science-backed strategies can help support &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-reduce-insulin-resistance-for-better-blood-sugar-8750433" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;better blood sugar management&lt;/a&gt; and overall metabolic health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move More, Especially After Meals&lt;/strong&gt;: Levin recommends regular physical activity, noting that walking after meals can enhance glucose uptake and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8060413/exercise-lower-blood-sugar-after-dinner-new-research/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a High-Fiber Diet&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-helped-me-eat-more-fiber-11734788" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Aim for 25–30 grams of fiber&lt;/a&gt; per day from whole plant foods like veggies, beans, fruits and whole grains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Quality Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;: Malhotra lists &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sleep-patterns-and-duration-may-determine-diabetes-risk-8683790" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;quality sleep&lt;/a&gt;—aiming for 7–8 hours—as a key lifestyle strategy to improve insulin sensitivity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid Ultra-Processed Foods&lt;/strong&gt;: These foods are often loaded with refined carbs, added sugars and unhealthy fats—all of which can worsen insulin resistance. Levin cautions against &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ultra-processed-foods-cardiovascular-disease-risk-8708994" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; due to their link to inflammation and poor blood sugar control.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While most people think of meat when they think of protein, plant-based proteins—especially tempeh—offer benefits for protecting against insulin resistance that many animal sources can’t. For example, tempeh contains probiotics and fiber, both of which are key for gut and metabolic health. It’s also a lean source of protein and contains potent antioxidants—plus, it’s versatile and easy to prepare. Broaden your view of protein, and you might just discover the plant-powered boost your metabolism needs.&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The internet is abuzz with tributes to a liquid chemical called &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557593/"&gt;methylene blue&lt;/a&gt; that is being sold as a health supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past five or 10 years, methylene blue has come to be touted online as a so-called &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/features/nootropics-smart-drugs-overview"&gt;nootropic agent&lt;/a&gt; – a substance that enhances cognitive function. Vendors claim that it amps up brain energy, improves memory, boosts focus and dispels brain fog, among other supposed benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health influencers, such as &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/whitecoat/methylene-blue-explainer-1.7531116"&gt;podcaster Joe Rogan&lt;/a&gt;, have sung its praises. In February 2025, shortly before he was confirmed as health and human services secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/rfk-jr-drinking-flight-methylene-blue-b2693495.html"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appeared in a video&lt;/a&gt; squirting a blue liquid widely presumed to be methylene blue into a glass – though he never verbally endorsed the substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a researcher &lt;a href="https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/pharmacy/faculty-staff/hofseth_lorne.php"&gt;studying inflammation and cancer&lt;/a&gt;, I investigate how dyes affect human health. Claims about methylene blue are alluring, and it's easy to buy into its promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But so far, evidence supporting its health benefits is scant, and there are some serious risks to using the substance outside of medical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_163858" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-163858" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/file-20250602-62-r06suq.jpg" alt="19th century bottle of methylene blue" class="wp-image-163858 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/file-20250602-62-r06suq.jpg 1920w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/file-20250602-62-r06suq-642x823.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/file-20250602-62-r06suq-324x415.jpg 324w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/file-20250602-62-r06suq-768x984.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/file-20250602-62-r06suq-1198x1536.jpg 1198w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/file-20250602-62-r06suq-1598x2048.jpg 1598w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/file-20250602-62-r06suq-600x769.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-163858" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Methylene blue was first synthesized in the 19th century by scientists at the German chemical company BASF.

My work and that of others suggest that many synthetic dyes widely used in foods and medicines can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/carcin/bgae057"&gt;trigger potentially harmful immune system reactions&lt;/a&gt; in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But unlike commonly used food dyes – one of which was &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/fda-bans-red-3-dye-from-food-and-drugs-a-scientist-explains-the-artificial-colors-health-risks-and-long-history-247757"&gt;recently banned by the US Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; – methylene blue is not derived from petroleum, also known as crude oil. Instead, it comes from a different family of dyes, which isn't thought to have these health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methylene blue was first synthesized in 1876 &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/med.20177"&gt;as a dye for textiles&lt;/a&gt; and was valued for its intense color and ability to bind well to fabrics. Soon after, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1159/000443526"&gt;German physician Paul Ehrlich&lt;/a&gt; discovered its ability to stain biological tissues and to kill the parasite that causes  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/malaria" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73073" data-postid="163830" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt; — making it &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2010.12.012"&gt;one of the first synthetic drugs&lt;/a&gt; used in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chemical didn't gain widespread use as a malaria treatment because it was no more effective than quinine, the standard therapy at the time. But in the 1930s, the dye found a new use in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(73)85407-4"&gt;testing the safety of raw or unpasteurized milk&lt;/a&gt;. If its blue color faded quickly, the milk was contaminated with bacteria, but if it remained blue, the milk was considered relatively clean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This safety test now is largely obsolete. But it works thanks to methylene blue's chemical superpower, which is that its molecules can swap electrons with other molecules, like a tiny battery charger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do doctors use it today?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That same chemical superpower enables some of methylene blue's medical uses. Most significantly, doctors use it to treat a rare blood disorder called &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24115-methemoglobinemia"&gt;methemoglobinemia&lt;/a&gt;, in which hemoglobin, an iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen, takes on a different form that can't do the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ajh.26340"&gt;Methylene blue restores hemoglobin's function&lt;/a&gt; by transferring an electron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors also sometimes use methylene blue to treat the effects of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/bcpt.12940"&gt;carbon monoxide poisoning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/ccmjournal/abstract/2001/10000/infusion_of_methylene_blue_in_human_septic_shock_.2.aspx"&gt;septic shock&lt;/a&gt; or toxicities from drugs such as chemotherapy. It is also used as a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/BCR.0b013e3181eed1d6"&gt;surgical dye to highlight specific tissues&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2217/fon-2016-0255"&gt;lymph nodes&lt;/a&gt;, or to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1159/000087871"&gt;identify where tissue is leaky&lt;/a&gt; and therefore may be damaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does methylene blue affect the brain?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2015.00179"&gt;Methylene blue can enter the brain&lt;/a&gt; by crossing the protective tissue barrier that surrounds it. Researchers have also found that the chemical can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/med.20177"&gt;protect and support mitochondria&lt;/a&gt;, cell structures that are often described as the powerhouses of the cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methylene blue &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pneurobio.2011.10.007"&gt;may help mitochondria generate energy&lt;/a&gt; for cells to use. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2013.11.010"&gt;For these reasons&lt;/a&gt;, researchers are studying methylene blue's effect on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, most of what's known about the substance's effects on the brain comes from studies in rats and in cells grown in a lab dish – not in people. For example, researchers have found that methylene blue &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3639.2010.00430.x"&gt;may improve learning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2020.00130"&gt;boost memory and protect brain cells in rats&lt;/a&gt; with a condition that mimics  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="163830" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies in rodents have also found that methylene blue can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2019.01133"&gt;protect the brain from damage from brain injury&lt;/a&gt;. Other studies showed that methylene blue is useful in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2017.10.033"&gt;treating ischemic stroke in rats&lt;/a&gt;. However, no research to date has examined whether it protects peoples' brains from traumatic brain injury or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A handful of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="163830" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; have investigated the effects of methylene blue in treating aspects of Alzheimer's disease in people, but a 2023 review of these trials notes that their results &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.46732"&gt;have been mixed and not conclusive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small study of 26 people found that a single low dose of the chemical &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11682-016-9541-6"&gt;boosted memory by about seven percent&lt;/a&gt; and increased brain activity during thinking tasks. Another study by the same researchers found that methylene blue changed how different parts of the brain connected, though it &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.46732"&gt;didn't improve thinking skills&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although some studies in people have shown hints that methylene blue may be beneficial for some brain-related issues, such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-022-02579-8"&gt;pain management&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2024.07.029"&gt;neuropsychiatric disorders&lt;/a&gt;, such studies to date have been small. This suggests that while there may be patient circumstances where methylene blue is beneficial, researchers have not yet pinned down what those are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is methylene blue safe?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methylene blue is generally safe when used under medical supervision. However, the chemical has some serious risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one thing, it can interact with widely used medications. Methylene blue &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF03017212"&gt;inhibits a molecule called monoamine oxidase&lt;/a&gt;, whose job is to break down an important brain chemical, serotonin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many commonly used &lt;a href="https://magazine.medlineplus.gov/article/commonly-prescribed-antidepressants-and-how-they-work"&gt;medications for treating anxiety and depression&lt;/a&gt; target serotonin. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2044.2009.06029.x"&gt;Taking the supplement&lt;/a&gt; along with these medicines &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-updated-information-about-drug-interaction-between-methylene-blue"&gt;can cause a condition called serotonin syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, which can lead to agitation, confusion, high  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fever" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73066" data-postid="163830" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt;, rapid heart rate, muscle stiffness and, in severe cases, seizures or even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In people with a rare &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/FPC.0b013e32836498f4"&gt;genetic deficiency of an enzyme called G6PD&lt;/a&gt;, methylene blue &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ajh.27324"&gt;can cause a dangerous condition&lt;/a&gt; in which red blood cells break down too quickly. At high doses, the chemical can also &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/sfx/methylene-blue-side-effects.html"&gt;raise blood pressure or cause heart problems&lt;/a&gt;. Also, it's considered unsafe for pregnant or breastfeeding women because it may &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0223(199601)16:1%3C39::AID-PD789%3E3.0.CO;2-P"&gt;harm the fetus or baby&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, while scientists have found hints of some fascinating properties of methylene blue, much larger, longer trials are needed to know if it truly works, what the right dose is and how safe it is over time.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/257159/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

This is a sign of good health and "may well be promoting colonisation resistance" so it is harder for new infectious bugs to get in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It's very exciting. There's a real shift from 20 years ago where all bacteria and viruses were assumed to do you harm; to now where we realise they are completely necessary to our overall health," says Dr Merrick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Earlier this week scientists showed the good bacteria our bodies meet – in the hours after we are born – seem to halve the risk of young children being admitted to hospital with lung infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Our body's own human cells are outnumbered by the bacteria, fungi and others that live inside us - known as the microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This has led to research implicating the microbiome in everything from Crohn's disease to cancer to mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;If poo pills are proven to work against superbugs in larger studies then the researchers think they could be used for both treatment and prevention in people at risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Medical procedures that suppress the immune system - including cancer therapies and organ transplants - can make the body more vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"A lot of these individuals come to a lot of harm from drug resistant organisms," Dr Merrick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The UK's drugs regulator – the Medicines and Healthcare Products Agency – said there were more than 450 microbiome medicines currently in development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Some of them will success, so I do think we will seem them coming through quite soon," said Dr Chrysi Sergaki, the head of microbiome research at the MHRA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We could potentially, in the future, replace antibiotics with microbiome [therapies] - that's the big picture, so there's a lot of potential."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 23:00:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTFAxTllyUVlvWDhyRWE0TVNOd3YzRXkwS1B5ejkwVDdmSmY4czFNdThrclpQdkhvQThiNjZJeGNXT2E0aVg2MTJJMFN0aXhvSDRHRG1zM3JKSXNtZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE5FSlM4VjRHaXJhNGlEck5xaVFOS3VLWnB4WnZwVnJZOWJhR0RCLVM0cWNMc1E4T1JtX0h2eS1jSXFGRzBmdy0zOFNlQ2ZkcVk1UnIxSzBnbDFYM1V5NlRN</guid></item><item><title>在“世界首例”手术中进行乳房移植以取代癌症--英国广播公司 | Breast transplanted to replace cancerous one in 'world first' operation - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE04aElNTEhndzBJNTgwN3lKSDNpUEp1STlXWTZwT2FfTjVxWWZXaUFNM3FKY3Fma1ZPUlBRcWxBUTA0OFNCZ1ZIWHRQTzFsUkY4MlZnc3d1dTlOUdIBX0FVX3lxTE53QVp3UTBMU1hiTWNKS1hna21jd1dMUldPY0VfQVBQU2h4VmtjYzdMb0lqU0FORk9QUURtREg5SGpxZWJ2ZklOTERhMlgyejE5VjNhR2JDdVpXSVowNDdZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;'My left breast was moved to my right after cancer recurred'&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/58c6/live/890b0ba0-42bd-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/58c6/live/890b0ba0-42bd-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/58c6/live/890b0ba0-42bd-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/58c6/live/890b0ba0-42bd-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/58c6/live/890b0ba0-42bd-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/58c6/live/890b0ba0-42bd-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/58c6/live/890b0ba0-42bd-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/58c6/live/890b0ba0-42bd-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Nicola Purdie Head and shoulders shot of Nicola Purdie standing against a white wall.

But for Nicola this was not a new experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She had already had a double mastectomy, chemotherapy and breast reconstruction after being diagnosed with cancer in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But a radical idea which she suggested to her surgeon has led to what is believed to be a pioneering world first procedure - transplanting a healthy reconstructed breast to replace a cancerous one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In September 2020, Nicola had just finished with breastfeeding her first child and was returning to work as a geography teacher in her home town of Swansea when she found a lump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;By October it was diagnosed as cancer and she started five months of chemotherapy at Singleton Hospital, followed by the double mastectomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Nicola, now 38, said: "Even though I only had cancer in the one breast, my maternal aunty and maternal grandmother also had had breast cancer previously. I thought 'I'm young, let's just get rid of everything and do as much as we can'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She had reconstructive surgery using skin and tissue from her abdomen in a procedure known as a DIEP (deep inferior epigastric perforator) flap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It meant I had natural breasts which would grow and shrink with my bodyweight over time and I wouldn't need implants that would need changing in 10 or 15 years," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Because the cancer was oestrogen-fuelled, she was placed on hormone  suppression therapy for at least two years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;'This is not a coincidence.

There must have been some cancer cells there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I knew straight away as soon as I found the lump, this is not a coincidence.

Partly it was to shield her daughter from knowing but she had another reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I wanted to protect the baby. I wanted him to come into the world and it to be all about him. I didn't want it to be focusing on 'oh gosh Nicky, you OK?'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She attributes this mindset to helping her "shut the door" on thinking about it until her son was born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Because of pregnancy, she could not begin chemotherapy, or have the usual scans to establish if the cancer had spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She had some chest X-rays and an ultrasound of her stomach and liver, which gave a degree of certainty, although not "100%", that it remained contained in the breast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She also had a lumpectomy to remove the lump from the breast skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1a32/live/246e6740-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1a32/live/246e6740-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1a32/live/246e6740-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1a32/live/246e6740-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1a32/live/246e6740-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1a32/live/246e6740-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1a32/live/246e6740-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1a32/live/246e6740-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Nicola Purdie Nicola is sitting in a chair in the special care baby unit.

"He went from strength to strength and that made things easier as well because of what I was dealing with. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I don't know how I would have been if he was poorly as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Nicola started chemotherapy two weeks after giving birth and would go from the baby unit upstairs to have her treatment and then straight back down to her son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She had 16 rounds of chemo which took her all the way through to the beginning of February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Initially the oncology team had not been sure what operation to suggest as Nicola had multiple cancer sites in the right breast area and a tumour in one lymph node. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The most likely option was removal and an LD (latissimus dorsi) flap, which involves swinging a muscle and skin from the back to cover the area left behind by the removed breast, but leaving the area flat in her case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Reconstruction using an implant on the right side instead would not have been possible as so much skin had to be removed, there would not be enough to cover it, or to withstand damage from subsequent radiation treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, Nicola's aunt had had the LD flap operation and she knew it came with an arduous recovery process and possibly reduced range of movement - not an option for her as the mother of two small children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She also knew she wanted "symmetry" - either two breasts or none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It was while talking to her sisters she initially had the idea that, if she did end up having both breasts removed, why not use the skin from the healthy left breast to cover the larger affected area on the right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But it was only once she was in the consulting room with consultant plastic, reconstructive and breast surgeon Reza Arya, that the idea of moving the whole breast intact dawned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/102f/live/6fd47760-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/102f/live/6fd47760-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/102f/live/6fd47760-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/102f/live/6fd47760-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/102f/live/6fd47760-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/102f/live/6fd47760-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/102f/live/6fd47760-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/102f/live/6fd47760-42be-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt='SBUHB Nicola Purdie, who has medium length blonde hair and is wearing a white t-shirt, stands next to surgeon Reza Arya, who is wearing a blue suit and tie and has short dark hair and glasses.

Around his family, he tried his best to appear strong and avoided discussions of his health. Privately, his severe anxiety over the possibility of a cancer recurrence kept him awake at night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors said the man was experiencing takotsubo cardiomyopathy — also known as broken heart syndrome, as documented in a 2021 case study. The rare stress-induced heart condition has been observed primarily in women, but a study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association in May found that the illness may be more deadly for the men who get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thought to be caused by extreme emotional or physical events — such as learning about the death of a loved one, winning the lottery or lifting a heavy sofa — takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or TC, occurs when the heart muscle is flooded with stress hormones, causing part of it to “freeze” in place. As the heart struggles to properly pump blood, symptoms resemble those of a heart attack, including chest pain, heart palpitations and irregular heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new study analyzed data from nearly 200,000 patients hospitalized for TC in the United States between 2016 and 2020. While women accounted for 83% of the cases, men were more than twice as likely to die from the condition — with a mortality rate of 11.2%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The differences between men and women are a very striking finding,” said study coauthor Dr. Mohammad Reza Movahed, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of Arizona in Tucson. “It raises a new, interesting question that should really be studied.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Broken heart syndrome in men vs.women&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Similar to differences between men’s and women’s cardiovascular health more generally, the discrepancies in TC death rates are not well understood, Movahed said, especially because they counter trends in other heart diseases. It’s widely theorized, however, that differences in hormone levels play a role.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stressful situations trigger the adrenal glands to release our fight-or-flight hormones, called catecholamines. They are meant to increase our blood pressure and raise our heart rate, but extreme levels can temporarily “stun” cells in the heart’s tissue, leading to TC, Movahed explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Men are thought to produce more catecholamines during stressful situations compared with women, possibly leading men to present with more severe cases of TC, he suggested.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Estrogen, a sex hormone produced at higher levels in women, may also have a protective effect on the cardiovascular system, making it easier to manage an extreme influx of catecholamines and reducing the risk of severe complications from TC, said Dr. Louis Vincent, a noninvasive-cardiology research fellow at the University of Miami, who coauthored a similar, multiyear study investigating discrepancies in men and women who had TC. Vincent was not involved in the new study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Beyond biological differences, social factors may play a role as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Most (physicians) know about takotsubo, but they may think of it as a disease just affecting women, so the diagnosis might be overlooked in men,” said Dr. Deepak Bhatt, a cardiologist and the director of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital who was not involved in the study. “With misdiagnosis, care is delayed, and that can sometimes lead to worse outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Men may also seek care at a later stage of illness, believing that their symptoms are manageable or may pass, said Dr. Alejandro Lemor, an assistant professor of interventional cardiology at the University of Mississippi Medical Center who was also not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Deadly complications from TC include blood clots, stroke, cardiac arrest and heart failure, Lemor said. If the condition is caught early, medications can reduce the risk of having these complications, restore proper heart function and allow for full recovery within weeks, he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Higher mortality rates in men need further study&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Movahed’s team was able to factor for important variables like age, race, income, chronic lung disease, hypertension and diabetes in the findings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, there was no patient data on other comorbid diseases, such as a history of stroke or the presence of a Covid-19 infection, Vincent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, the new study included in-patient diagnostic data only for those hospitalized with TC, so those who received outpatient care or died later from complications outside the hospital were likely not counted in the analysis, Movahed noted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To establish a firmer explanation for the differences in mortality rates between men and women and further test treatment methods, a more detailed dataset would be needed, Vincent said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“People should be aware in studies like this, we’re presenting findings that are based on diagnostic codes, and we’re not looking at patient procedures or lab results,” Vincent said. “But it’s powerful in the sense that it lets us look at large populations and look at trends. And I think that this trend of a higher mortality in men is worth taking a deeper look into.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Don’t try to ‘tough it out’&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sudden, severe chest pain or shortness of breath should always be treated as a medical emergency, warned Bhatt, who is also a professor of cardiovascular medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s not a time to tough it out at home or get on the internet to figure it out. … Don’t try to track down your primary care provider. Call emergency services,” Bhatt said. “Time matters. By winning those few hours, you could save yourself irreparable damage to your heart.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Symptoms following physical stressors — a common cause of TC in men — should not be ignored, Movahed said, especially preceding medical events such as asthma attacks, seizures or complications from drug use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And while TC is caused by sudden stress, Bhatt said that managing chronic stress with daily meditation or exercise can lead to better cardiovascular health overall while giving you routines to fall back on in unexpected situations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The-CNN-Wire&lt;br&gt; ™ &amp;amp; © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

He was afraid of dying from &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-bae97520-431d-11f0-b84b-11a11e1504e0"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He remembers seeing sufferers on TV growing up, with their listless expressions and inability to walk. It left him certain he did not want to develop the devastating condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His worst fear was revealed when he used the Death Clock - an &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/ai/index.html" id="mol-6c5e63a0-42e3-11f0-b03f-eb5df1894984"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; that predicts - down to the minute - when and how a person will die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Franson invented the app, which analyzes a person's body metrics and lifestyle, and input his own information. The 43-year-old was shocked when the Death Clock projected his demise at 76 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14757525/First-subtle-sign-dementia-strike-20-years-disease-sets-experts-discover-condition-stealth-phase.html"&gt;possible causes of his death: Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;. It made sense, Franson thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his 20s, he had become addicted to anti depressants and sedatives, which left him unable to sleep properly for a decade - a risk factor for neurological decline - and he had a gene that predisposed him to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Franson was also working late, eating large late-night dinners and balancing his role as husband and father-of-three. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Determined to change his fate, however, Franson made major lifestyle changes - becoming what he called a 'sleep athlete.' He fine-tuned his schedule to make time for rest and exercise and to create a better work-life balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One year later, he ran his information through the Death Clock again and it revised its estimate — adding an extra nine years to his life expectancy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brent Franson is the CEO of Death Clock, a groundbreaking app that gives users a prediction of the day they are going to die &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most likely cause of death? Alzheimer's was still a possibility, but so were cardiovascular diseases and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Something does have to kill you eventually,' Franson told DailyMail.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'My biggest fear in life, it's not death. It's Alzheimer's. Just the thought of having to live with Alzheimer's — so this was really a wake-up call for me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the aging population of the US continues to grow, so will the rates of dementia. Currently, an estimated 6.8million Americans have Alzheimer's disease - the most common form of dementia - the vast majority of whom are over 65 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By 2050, this number is projected to rise to nearly 13 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A lack of sleep - especially a lack of deep sleep - has been linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's in numerous studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say it stops the body from clearing out waste products from the brain — raising the risk of dangerous amyloid beta protein clumps forming that raise someone's risk of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than one in three adults — 50 to 70million people — regularly do not meet the CDC's recommendation of at least seven hours of sleep every night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study has suggested sleeping six or fewer hours per night before age 70 is linked to a 30 percent increased risk of dementia compared to people getting seven hours or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also drive other unhealthy behaviors, like exercising less or eating more sugary treats, which can also raise risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To boost his sleep, and slash his risk of Alzheimer's, Franson began by banning all mobile phones from the bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He set a consistent bedtime of 9.30pm, and made sure to have his last meal at 5.30pm every night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists say a consistent bedtime helps the body's circadian rhythm while eating too close to bedtime means the body is still digesting, disrupting sleep. Some suggest it can take three to four hours for a meal to transit into the intestines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also lowered the bedroom temperature to 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius). Experts recommend sleeping at temperatures between 60 and 67 degrees to reduce the body's internal temperature and ensure a restful night's sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He had two sets of blackout blinds installed in his bedroom, as well. One that descends horizontally from the ceiling, and another that moves vertically across the window, to block out all light while he sleeps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Death Clock app asks users to describe their lifestyle, including exercise and diet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another lifestyle change was cutting out alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol has also been linked to sleep disruption, reducing the amount of time spent in REM sleep — a stage for memory consolidation — disrupting the sleep cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Alzheimer's Society says drinking alcohol also reduces the volume of the brain's white matter, which helps the brain transmit signals between different regions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can lead to issues with the way the brain functions. Alcohol can also shrink the parts of the brain involved in memory.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Franson also makes sure to exercise during the day, saying he alternates between weight lifting, cardio exercises and yoga. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A July 2022 study published in the journal Neurology analyzed the health information of 501,400 people from a British health database over 11 years. Researchers found people who engaged in consistent vigorous activity — sports or working out — had a 35 percent reduced risk of developing dementia. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even people who reported completing household chores saw a benefit and had a 21 percent lower risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate October 2022 meta-analysis of 38 international studies found people who engaged in activities like regularly walking, running, dancing, playing sports or swimming had a 17 percent reduced risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease compared to those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while there is plenty of fancy and expensive health tech, Franson said sleep, diet and exercise are more than 90 percent of the puzzle of longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added that nine percent was cancer screenings and about one percent was 'all this crazy stuff that people like to talk about.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Franson added: 'The discussion in the longevity space is often focused on the wrong thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People devote a lot of time talking about things like Ashwaganda or full-body scans when, compared to sleep, diet and exercise, these are going to make only tiny incremental differences.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/the-worst-airport-you-ve-ever-traveled-through-1851225030/" target="_blank"&gt;Airports are full of people&lt;/a&gt;, and sadly, far too many people still choose to fly even when they're sick, which means you could get sick. It's been that way for a while, but at the very least, you used to be able to count on everyone (or almost everyone) having their vaccinations, so you didn't have to worry about catching some old-timey disease we eliminated a long time ago. &lt;a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/nearly-300-quarantined-on-reported-church-of-scientolog-1834461426/" target="_blank"&gt;That's no longer the case&lt;/a&gt;, and it's gotten to the point that &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level1/measles-globe" target="_blank"&gt;the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; is cautioning travelers about the risk of measles in airports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, thanks to all the idiots who decided they didn't need modern medicine, measles is back in the U.S., with more than 1,100 cases reported so far this year, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/05/health/measles-exposures-travelers-wellness" target="_blank"&gt;CNN reports&lt;/a&gt;. As it turns out, when a bunch of parents stop getting their kids vaccinated, they get diseases we eliminated in the U.S. decades ago. Who could have guessed? And with plenty of travel still expected this summer, you now have to worry about the spread of a previously eliminated disease that can cause seizures and blindness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events. Infected travelers can bring the disease back to their home communities where it can spread rapidly among people who are not immune," the CDC said in an updated travel notice.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to CNN, measles was officially eliminated in the U.S. back in 2000. There were still 85 cases reported, but those were all caught in other countries and brought back into the U.S. But as more people bought into conspiracy theories, especially in Texas, parents began turning their backs on science, and measles came back. Back in 2019, the worst year for measles on record since 2000, there were 1,274, and we're already on track to more than double that this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is, the MMR vaccine still works, so as long as you're up to date on your vaccines, you should be fine. Per updated CDC guidance, every adult should have two doses of the MMR vaccine, but infants between 6 months and 11 months old should get an extra dose if they're traveling. The MMR vaccine is not, however, recommended for those who are pregnant, less than six months old or have weak immune systems. So while those who are vaccinated may have nothing to worry about, babies, the elderly and those who are immunocompromised definitely do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Hotez, the co-director of the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, also told CNN that parents shouldn't worry about their kids getting an extra dose of the vaccine, saying, "The MMR vaccine is one of the safest vaccines we know."&lt;/p&gt;

That's just a fact. Vaccines also work and have worked incredibly well for decades, regardless of what Republicans want you to believe. So far this year, &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/texas-announces-second-measles-death-unvaccinated-child" target="_blank"&gt;two kids and one adult have already died from the measles&lt;/a&gt;, and there's a good chance we'll see those numbers rise in the coming months as traveling anti-vaxxers spread their old-timey diseases to other travelers. And even those who live could easily end up hospitalized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In the 1980s, measles was the single leading killer of children globally. It [led to] 3 million deaths annually. Now, through the GAVI Vaccine Alliance and other programs, we've brought it down to around 100,000 deaths, but it's still a lot," Hotez told &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;. "And we're seeing what happens in West Texas. Ten percent, 20% of kids are being hospitalized, measles, pneumonia, neurologic injury. We've had over 90 hospitalizations so far in Texas and two measles deaths."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A healthy diet that contains a variety of foods is great, as is exercise, but anyone who tells you a healthy lifestyle alone will keep your kids safe from measles is lying to you. Germs don't care about your feelings and will get you sick. Period. So make sure everyone you travel with has their shots. Otherwise, that summer vacation you've been planning could come to a nasty, early end.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

    
&lt;/article&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re trying to eat a more anti-inflammatory diet to reduce the risk of chronic disease or help manage symptoms of an inflammatory condition, the best place to start may be adding more color to your plate. “An anti-inflammatory diet focuses on &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8007622/vegetables-you-should-be-eating-every-week/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;colorful, nutrient-dense foods&lt;/a&gt; like fruits and vegetables, healthy fats, and inflammation-fighting herbs and spices,” says &lt;a href="https://www.corenutritionhw.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Julie Pace, RDN&lt;/a&gt;.  “This pattern of eating can benefit most anyone, but is especially helpful for those managing health conditions such as autoimmune disorders, heart disease, menopause and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7909480/best-foods-for-digestion/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;digestive issues&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Data suggests that 85 percent of the United States population is not getting the recommended amount of fruit each day, while 90 percent is falling short on vegetables.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Focusing on more color in your diet will naturally help you eat more fruits and veggies, both of which play a significant role in overall health and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-avoid-for-chronic-inflammation-8644317" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reducing the risk of inflammatory diseases&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As fiber is fermented by the bacteria in your gut, inflammation-fighting short-chain fatty acids are produced. Butyrate, a particularly beneficial short-chain fatty acid, provides energy to the cells in the gut lining, helping to strengthen its integrity and keeping inflammatory substances from leaking out of the gut into the rest of the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While you could take a supplement to boost your micronutrient intake, it probably won’t have the same powerful anti-inflammatory effect as getting them from your diet. Research suggests that various compounds found in plants activate and intensify the inflammation-fighting power of various vitamins and minerals. For example, resveratrol, a polyphenol found in cranberries, blueberries, and plums, has anti-inflammatory and antipoxidant effects, and also acts synergistically with vitamins A and C.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Aside from adding the rainbow to your plate, here are some other simple and effective ways to get more anti-inflammatory foods into your diet: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use more&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/32764/eight-of-the-worlds-healthiest-spices-herbs-you-should-be-eating/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; herbs and spices&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; “Try adding a dash of turmeric to salad dressings, sprinkle cardamom over berries, or mix in parsley and oregano into your favorite dishes. These small additions to your meals can make a significant difference when it comes to fighting inflammation,” says Pace. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stock your freezer&lt;/strong&gt;: Fresh isn’t always best, especially when it comes to keeping nutrients intact. “Frozen foods are often picked at the peak of ripeness and can be very convenient since they're already cut and you can pop them into the microwave to round out the colors on your plate,” says Radloff. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase your colors one by one&lt;/strong&gt;: If you’re barely getting one serving of fruits or vegetables per day, don’t overcomplicate it by adding too many at once. “Set a goal to include at least one additional serving of fruits or vegetables in your diet each day,” says Jaeger. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get inspired by the Mediterranean diet&lt;/strong&gt;: If you’d rather have a guideline to follow than just picking up more fruits and vegetables from the grocery store, following a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7763980/mediterranean-diet-plan-for-beginners/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;simple Mediterranean meal plan&lt;/a&gt; can help. &lt;/li&gt;

                                            minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — "More men die with prostate cancer than because of it" has become a common phrase used when discussing prostate cancer. While it can be true for some men, the reality is that regular screenings can save a life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;World Prostate Cancer Day is June 11. Taking a few minutes to be aware of the symptoms and the screening process can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With former President Joe Biden being diagnosed with prostate cancer, discussion about the topic has seen an increase. Still, receiving regular screenings for prostate cancer has been deemed controversial in the medical world. Due to opposing studies presented by cancer and medical societies, it has become difficult to know if it is truly necessary to get checked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to think of patients as a whole person and not consider age as just a number," said Intermountain Health oncologist Dr. David Gill. "A quarter of men in their 70s will make it to 90. … I recommend we consider life expectancy and not just age. For men whose life expectancy is 10 years or greater, I do recommend prostate cancer screening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key symptoms of prostate cancer include changes in urinary problems and increased fatigue. With most prostate cancer appearing after age 50, warning symptoms can often be disregarded as aging. As such, regular screenings are not always at the forefront of an individual's mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, Gill has seen firsthand how important screenings can be. A patient currently undergoing treatment discovered recently that he has Lynch Syndrome. The condition drastically increases the chances of developing prostate cancer. Through his regular screening, the patient was able to receive treatment for himself, but also help his family to get screened as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lynch Syndrome is commonly found in families, and so the discovery made all the difference in receiving treatment for both men and women in the family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular screenings are not as invasive as many may think, according to Gill. The physical screening is only necessary for advanced stages. The typical screening is done through a bit of blood work. The blood work provides a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, that indicates the presence and severity of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah's cancer rates differ from national trends, largely due to the state's low smoking rates. As a result, Utah has significantly lower incidences of lung cancer. Consequently, prostate cancer is the No. 1 cancer in men throughout Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While lung cancer is inflamed by smoking, prostate cancer can be caused by many factors "out of our control," according to Gill. Genetic factors, different syndromes and race can all play a role in prostate cancer. &lt;a href="https://zerocancer.org/black-men" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;African American men have a larger chance of developing prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt; and should be screened more frequently. Regular screenings can mean a world of difference for the effectiveness of treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest misconception is that prostate cancer is always an indolent disease. It is true that a lot of men with prostate cancer won't need treatment for it. For low-risk, low-grade disease, we can monitor it," Gill explained. "But, it doesn't take away the fact that prostate cancer can be advanced, aggressive and can be terminal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awareness is key to preventing terminal illness, Gill believes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I recommend two things. It is great to gather family history. For prostate cancer, it's not only about men in the family, it's also important to ask women who have had breast or ovarian cancer," Gill said. "Discussing with a primary care provider is important. Guidelines vary, so it's a bit complicated, but a primary care provider can have that discussion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gill recommends beginning screenings at age 50 for most men. Those with high risk factors, such as a family history of prostate cancer, can begin screenings as early as 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

There may be gurus everywhere telling us our real problem is a lack of commitment and effort, but she says that the real path to wellness starts very simply with the smallest of acts that add up to a big impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A somatic healing and burnout expert said you can retrain your brain in just two-minute increments.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reclaiminghealthy.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Melissa Romano&lt;/a&gt; is an author and expert on mental health and burnout who is certified in somatic healing and other neuroscience-based therapeutic modalities. In a recent video &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@reclaimingmelissa" rel="nofollow"&gt;on her TikTok account&lt;/a&gt;, she addressed common misconceptions that make many people feel like actually healing their brains is out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You don't need to meditate for an hour a day to rewire your brain," she said in her video. "You don't need to carve out an hour a day of anything to rewire your brain." That's because that's not actually how our brains are designed to operate in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/ways-unhappiest-people-retrain-brain-feel-confident-optimistic"&gt;5 Ways Even The Unhappiest People Can Retrain Their Brain To Feel Confident &amp;amp; Optimistic, According To A Neuroplastician&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Our brains are designed to maintain the status quo. Working with that, not against it, is key.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You also "don’t need more willpower," she said. The gurus who insist this don't know what they're talking about, because willpower is quite literally not how brains work. Their literal job is to maintain the status quo to keep you "safe," which our brains define as "not being chased by a tiger" because they formed and evolved tens of thousands of years ago when that was our reality!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/mentally-strong-say-goodbye-these-habits"&gt;quitting things cold turkey&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, tends to be impossible for nearly all of us. It's quite literally against what our brains are designed to do. The same is true of trying to, say, meditate an hour a day or whatever advice the guru du jour is giving. Your brain is going to fight you every step of the way. It wants the status quo!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also why big, sweeping self-care and mental wellness projects don't work. Romano, by her own admission, is someone who has tried pretty much every healing modality, and has gotten certified in many of them too, including forcing herself to meditate for an hour a day like so many recommend. But that's not what ultimately worked for her either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/superpower-flexes-your-brain-how-use-neuroplasticity"&gt;The science of neuroplasticity&lt;/a&gt;, however, has proven that we do in fact have the power to help our brains shift the status quo it seeks. The key is not willpower or big changes but, in Roman's words, "rhythm, structure, and science-backed tools that work with your nervous system — not against it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/neuroscientist-tips-stop-brain-holding-back-achieving-goals"&gt;Neuroscientist Shares 3 Tips To Stop Your Brain From Holding You Back From Achieving Your Goals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The healing and burnout expert said all it takes is consistent 2-minute increments of healing practices to retrain your brain.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romano said that for her, what "actually moved the needle required no carving out of large chunks of time" but rather "focusing on my basic needs and then doing a little bit at a time, often." She started with things like drinking enough water and eating enough, then "doing a little bit of time, often" when it came to healing practices like meditation or somatic exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was carving out two to five minutes a couple times a day. And this took no major shifts or changes in anything." She just worked a couple of quick bursts into her schedule each day. Sometimes it was just "laying starfish on the floor" or "bouncing and shaking" her body. Other times, it was more structured nervous system regulation practices like grounding techniques. The &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/how-use-54321-method-stop-panic-attacks"&gt;5-4-3-2-1 technique&lt;/a&gt; — naming five things you can see, four you can feel, three you can hear, two you can smell, and one you can taste — is one that has worked wonders for me, personally.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-06/expert-said-consistent-two-minute-intervals-retrain-brain.png" alt="Woman Retraining Brain In 2 Minutes A Day" title="Retrain Your Brain In Less Time Than It Takes To Brush Your Teeth" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Ingrid Santana | Pexels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whatever felt good to me in those two to five minutes at that point in the day" was what she went with. Breathing exercises, somatic movements, dancing, walking in place—whatever gets you out of your head and into your body for two minutes a couple times a day. And Romano explained that over time, this regulates your nervous system to a point that makes it easier to take on bigger self-care projects, like getting better sleep or, yes, meditating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone who actually does meditate for an hour (or sometimes more!) a few times a week, I can confirm that this works. I started with 30 seconds of what felt like utterly useless, incompetent meditation, but over time, my brain adapted. It became willing to shift my "status quo" until 30 seconds became a minute, then five, then 10, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is this: The wellness influencers and gurus who tell you &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/signs-burned-out-person-nothing-left-to-give"&gt;healing from burnout and anxiety&lt;/a&gt; is about big, dramatic self-improvement projects are fundamentally wrong. Most of them are selling you something, even if the product is just their image, and you feeling like a hopeless failure is literally part of the sales pitch. Tune it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, start with bites as small as you need, stick with it, and build from there. Your brain WILL adapt if you ease into it. You'll slowly gain more control over your mental state, and that's when the real healing can begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/people-specific-hobby-happier-healthier-smarter"&gt;People Who Have This One Specific Hobby Are Happier, Healthier, &amp;amp; Smarter, Says Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;John Sundholm is a writer, editor, and video personality with 20 years of experience in media and entertainment.

Some people are sensitive [to fermented foods]. Things that inflame the intestine would be most likely to be one of the factors in the development of colon cancer in these people.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers have found that consuming excessive cheese can ruin good gut bacteria - which can lead to an increased risk for colon cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cheese fermentation is the process of allowing bacteria to turn the natural sugars found in milk (lactose) into lactic acid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The production of lactic acid lowers the pH of the milk which causes the liquid to form curds - that then becomes the solid part of cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Baylor College researchers studied 34 people - nearly all men - who had a scheduled colonoscopy between August 2013 and April 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Li Jiao, lead author and associate gastroenterology professor at Baylor College of Medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants were asked to report their total intake of total dairy, milk, cheese, and yogurt through self-reported questionnaire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also collected colon tissue samples from the participants to study their gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The samples and their individual answers were then evaluated using various statistical models and biological tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found that consuming excessive cheese was linked to a reduction in the bacteria Bacteroides and Subdoligranulum, which are both crucial for keeping the stomach, colon and immune system healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Li Jiao, lead author and associate gastroenterology professor at Baylor College of Medicine, and her team also found that participants who ate more dairy and milk exhibited a higher relative abundance of Faecalibacterium - a bacteria known for its anti-inflammatory properties. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although yogurt is often considered beneficial for gut health, the study did not find a link between inflammation and yogurt intake. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Additionally, she also told the Daily Mail that she prefers tofu as a substitute for dairy and cheese. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'Personally, I choose tofu and hummus as nutritional substitutes. Tofu is a good source of both protein and calcium.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When asked about what cheese-lovers can do to prevent colon cancer, Dr Fischer noted: 'The way to prevent cancer I think is having colonoscopies and making sure you're taking probiotics every day.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also noted that lactose in milk - which is removed during cheese fermentation - can lead to growth of good bacteria and keep cancer at bay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bailey Hutchins of Tennessee, pictured, died of colon cancer at just 26 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Talking about whether cheese can affect gut bacteria levels, Dr Fischer noted: 'It can. It's very suspicious&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jiao told the Daily Mail: 'Our research aligns with previous studies indicating an increased risk of certain diseases with elevated cheese intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Notably, some of the previous research has shown that a higher intake of saturated fat is associated with increased risk of colon cancer and many cheeses are high in saturated fat. Moderation is key when it comes to food.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over 50,000 Americans are &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7596189/Cases-pancreatic-colorectal-cancer-soared-10-world-1990.html" class=""&gt;expected to die from colorectal cancer this year&lt;/a&gt;, while 150,000 are predicted to be diagnosed with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While still a minority, experts remain concerned about increasing cases among younger people as officials estimate 2,600 new cases among those under 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies also suggest that cases in people aged between 20 to 24 have risen from 0.7 to 2 per 100,000 people as of 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases are also expected to double between 2010 and 2030, after having risen two percent a year since the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists believe that an increasing consumption of microplastics, excessive pollution and high dependence on prescription medication can cause inflammation and lead to cancer development in the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Marisa Peters, pictured above, was diagnosed with early-onset colon cancer at the age of 33 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Heather Candrilli (left) was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer last spring at 36 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However previous studies have also shown that low levels of Bacteroides can lead to &lt;span&gt;colorectal cancer while decreased Subdoligranulum have been linked to metabolism related disorders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Low amounts of Bacteroides can also produce toxins that can induce the transformation of normal cells to cancerous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jiao said: 'Taken together, both Bacteroides and Subdoligranulum are contributors to a healthy and complex gut ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Dairy products can change the types and amounts of bacteria living along the lining of the colon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These bacteria are known to play important physiological roles in the body. In addition, different types of dairy products may affect these gut bacteria in different ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Higher consumption of cheese [reduced] was related to a lower diversity of the gut bacteria in our study.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, evidence of the link between cheese and colon cancer is mixed as other studies suggest that the dairy product can protect the gut from harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2021 Frontiers in Oncology &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2022.812679/full"&gt;literature review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2022.812679/full"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;found that consuming cheese was 89 percent less likely to cause colorectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found that the high pH balance, low salt and high oxygen in cheese allow for long-term gut bacteria survival - which can help improve digestion and protect the colon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the Frontiers study noted that Swedish people, who regularly consume cheese for breakfast have low rates of colorectal cancer - indicating that there is a slight relationship between consuming cheese and developing the disease &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 17:16:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiywFBVV95cUxPNkMwSjh3cGtnTVRyQ0J2ZXM5eEZGTEJuY2M4STF1N3hpU2VCWVBsbGNTLVhONi1FQlVUcEljWldTQmZ6d1JtZWpwUDUycGZZa0g0eVluUG1fS3B1RmNpWnFzTjQxQXNrZUp1QWVhX1JySElqS1dxS01fRXZKVFdoV1RUMkEyY0w1ay1ubC1KaXdaZXlIN1N0RVY4aFp4Tm1aelhPc2hHOS1sVFJ4Z1dhUng5NmRZSWxKTENJSVBvbDg0Wmx0Tnd0Sk4zQQ</guid></item><item><title>毕竟，生物黑客喜爱的嗡嗡声抗衰老补充剂实际上可能没有那么有用--《纽约邮报》 | Buzzy anti-aging supplement beloved by biohackers may not actually be that useful after all - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxNVWVMZ2pSSkdBUFZJbHp5Q0FndFprQWxLMUZlMW1LQlZob3dwNWdRVWdtb2gxWFBWN3pERjYwUGxSYWpWNjZzZ2Rua1NDRjZzd0lPbTNrZy1rd3V6ek4wcnllQjVreDdZazJWbDNNaUUtSmw3MGp0Z0cwOWQycld1MjFSMFd2anliRExjTTV1RGVrNldkZ3U2RWJ4ZnU1bEVkelE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;Biohackers, take note. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests that a supplement popular in longevity circles may not be the anti-aging breakthrough it’s been cracked up to be.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings cast doubt on earlier research that hyped it as a potential “&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/06/09/taurine-in-energy-drinks-may-be-an-elixir-of-life-study/"&gt;elixir of life&lt;/a&gt;,” after it appeared to improve health and extend lifespan in worms, mice and monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Taurine supplements have become popular among biohackers for their potenetial longevity benefits.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;ÃÂÃÂ»ÃÂµÃÂºÃÂÃÂµÃÂ¹ ÃÅ¡ÃÂ¾ÃÂ·ÃÂ° – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taurine is an amino acid with a wide range of roles, including supporting immune and nervous system health.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While our bodies naturally produce taurine, a &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn9257" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; suggested its levels decline with age in humans, mice and monkeys. That same research found taurine supplements helped mice live 10-12% longer — roughly the equivalent of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/13/health/anti-aging-doc-supplement-can-add-7-to-8-years-to-your-life/"&gt;seven to eight human years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The findings sparked hope that taurine levels could serve as a blood-based biomarker for aging, sparking a wave of interest among biohackers. Longevity figures like &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/shopping/bryan-johnson-blueprint-longevity-mix-review/"&gt;Bryan Johnson&lt;/a&gt; quickly added taurine supplements to their routines, chasing longer, healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But they might have jumped the gun.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Biohacker Bryan Johnson is among those who have embraced taurine. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adl2116" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; from scientists at the National Institutes of Health measured taurine levels in humans of various ages, plus monkeys and mice. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Contrary to earlier research, they found no steady decline with age — in fact, taurine levels stayed stable or even rose as participants got older.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scientists suggested that limitations in previous research might explain the conflicting results. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most earlier studies were “cross-sectional,” meaning they examined many participants of different ages at a single point in time rather than following the same subjects over an extended period.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new study, meanwhile, combined both cross-sectional and longitudinal data, with the latter involving blood samples collected at multiple time points from the same groups of people and lab animals as they aged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Previous research found that taurine could extend the lifespans of mice.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;filin174 – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Notably, the scientists found that taurine levels did vary between participants, but these differences were influenced more by factors like sex and species than by aging itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“On the basis of these findings, we conclude that low circulating taurine concentrations are unlikely to serve as a good biomarker of aging,” they said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scientists also noted that the effectiveness of taurine supplements for delaying aging or treating age-related conditions likely depends on numerous factors and individual circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Seafood, particularly shellfish, is a rich source of taurine.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;kenwnj – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean taurine doesn’t have any health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The amino acid is a powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent that supports digestion, energy production, immune response, neurological development, brain function, eyesight, nerve and muscle conduction and more.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Although your body produces some taurine naturally, it’s still important to get it from your diet to maintain optimal levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most people on a typical &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/05/health/switching-to-a-western-diet-shocks-tanzanian-mens-bodies/"&gt;Western diet&lt;/a&gt; get ample taurine from animal-based foods like seafood, meat, and dairy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vegans and vegetarians, however, may have lower levels since taurine isn’t found in most plants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those groups and others, supplements can help fill the gap. Taurine is also a common ingredient in energy drinks and bars.&lt;/p&gt;

After sweating it out on the court or on the pitch, you slide into a tub of freezing cold water to keep the muscle cramps away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lately, the practice has gained popularity in wellness and bodybuilding circles — with the additional step of snapping a photo of yourself to signal that you belong to a higher echelon of physical specimen — but influencer gym bros especially. You know the type: selling you branded protein powders, a program for "INSANE" gainz, and form-fitting Gymshark tees.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But a &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/abstract/9900/post_exercise_cooling_lowers_skeletal_muscle.781.aspx" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Medicine &amp;amp; Science in Sports and &amp;amp; Exercise&lt;/em&gt;, throws some cold water on the purported benefits of the practice. And hilariously, it seems to produce the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;exact opposite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; effects you'd want as a person trying to build muscle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It looks like it's not a great idea" to soak in freezing water after lifting weights, lead author Milan Betz, a researcher at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/06/04/cold-plunge-ice-bath-benefits/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;span&gt;told the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Washington Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wait, you may ask as a person unfamiliar with the practice, why was microdosing hypothermia a thing in the first place? There are purported benefits, backed by limited science. The biggest upside that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/ice-baths-are-popular-for-exercise-recovery-and-general-wellness-but-what-does-the-science-say-250649" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;span&gt;research has shown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; so far&lt;span&gt; is that an icy dip can help with muscle soreness by reducing post-exercise inflammation and flushing out lactates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That makes it more well-suited for aerobic athletes like runners, soccer players, and swimmers. But anyone training for strength? That's a different story.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As part of the study, the researchers had a dozen healthy young men perform a leg workout, and when they were finished, immediately submerge one leg in a bucket of warm water (80 degrees Fahrenheit), and another leg in a bucket of icy water (30 degrees), for 20 minutes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To wrap up, all of them were given a protein shake that contained a biochemical tracer, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;WaPo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, allowing the researchers to see where the protein traveled in the volunteers' bloodstreams.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Much of that protein, it seems, may be going to waste. Ultrasound imaging revealed that blood flow in the cold-plunged legs dropped considerably compared to the warm leg — and stayed that way for hours. That constriction, as a result, cut off a lot of protein from reaching the strained leg muscles. Less protein, of course, means fewer gains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brad Schoenfeld, a noted exercise scientist at Lehman College in New York known for his bodybuilding advice, co-authored a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ejsc.12074" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;2024 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; which suggested that ice baths could harm hypertrophy. Responding to this latest research, Schoenfeld told &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;WaPo &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;that its findings "provide confirmatory evidence" that a reduction of protein uptake is responsible for these negative effects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Still, it's not over for ice baths. This was a small study, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;and one which only focused on one specific approach. The participants plunged immediately after the workout — but most advice out there recommends waiting several hours. Immersion time could be a major factor, too. There could be psychological benefits, and if your personal experience suggests that to be the case, "there’s no reason to change your mind," Benz told &lt;em&gt;WaPo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That said, Betz recommends that if you're all about gains, you should pass on taking a plunge right after your workout.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on fitness: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/another-bodybuilder-died-oil-injections" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;Another Bodybuilder Just Died a Horrible Death&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>futurism.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 16:45:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiXEFVX3lxTFBuT29SR3h4UTZuTE0tWVpUNHRwN24zT1Mxcm90dE1KTXZGWllCaTh2WTJITEZGdm5YQ25FZll3WU0tVmFETzZCeXVKVDd3ajlVbC1GRmtBMlBDelZ5</guid></item><item><title>登革热的风险只是邮轮很糟糕的另一个原因- Jalopnik | Risk Of Dengue Fever Is Just Another Reason Cruises Suck - Jalopnik</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE5UUzk5WjJQSmd6OXc1dFFRdjQzbGNVb29jZnNiQ3FtVlV2Y1owd0x6RTh5bFBQYms0TURDOGVza3RfNWRsZllvRldzS2w1WkJvaFFlLW9pU3dnZnBGLWd5N1NJRmdkNFZyV1dtazZLQ1NBX1d0czRhSUd2VlM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="content" class="article"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/cruise-ship-construction-is-like-a-well-choreographed-b-1851761345/" target="_blank"&gt;Watching a cruise ship come together is incredibly cool&lt;/a&gt;, but having to actually go out and cruise on one is &lt;a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/cruise-ships-are-so-boring-they-built-one-that-lets-you-1851596413/" target="_blank"&gt;another story entirely&lt;/a&gt;. Every cruise ship is a small tourist-trap city, packed to the brim with the most entitled and sunburned people you'll ever have the misfortune of meeting. And now, according to the Centers for Disease Control, the cruise experience is only getting better: A number of popular cruise destinations are facing outbreaks of dengue fever. Fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dengue is far from the first disease outbreak we've seen around cruise ships — the &lt;a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/1825413/queen-mary-2-cruise-ship-norovirus-outbreak/" target="_blank"&gt;Queen Mary 2 saw a norovirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt; already this year, after &lt;a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/cruise-ship-stomach-bug-illnesses-hit-12-year-high-cdc-1851732102/" target="_blank"&gt;2024's record number of shipborne stomach bugs&lt;/a&gt; — but this one is bigger than any one ship. The outbreak is hitting multiple continents, &lt;a href="https://www.thestreet.com/travel/cdc-warns-of-deadly-disease-outbreak-in-key-cruise-ports" target="_blank"&gt;according to The Street&lt;/a&gt;, including Mexico, Panama, and Caribbean islands like Saint Lucia — some of the &lt;a href="https://www.thestreet.com/travel/what-are-the-busiest-cruise-ship-ports-2025" target="_blank"&gt;most popular ports for cruises out of the United States to visit&lt;/a&gt;. Cruise ships are packed with people, allowing diseases to spread and fester from bow to stern, and you want to go sail on one? On the boats where they'll &lt;a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/cruise-ship-stored-dead-body-in-drinks-cooler-for-6-day-1850368004/" target="_blank"&gt;put your corpse in a drink cooler to stop it stinking up the joint&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dengue is a mosquito-borne illness, and mosquitos are famously capable of flight. Even if you stay on the ship at an affected port of call, its proximity to the shore could allow infected mosquitoes to make their way aboard and suckle at your sweet, sweet flesh — giving you headaches, fever, rashes, nausea, and vomiting in the process. Y'know where doesn't have dengue fever? Toronto! Go visit that on vacation. The food will almost certainly be better, and you can leave if you want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all major cruise locales are affected by this outbreak — Alaska, traditionally a popular destination, reportedly remains dengue-free — but there are enough ports besieged by infected mosquitoes that you should maybe reconsider your next cruise. Even if you're not bound for dengue territory, actually, you should probably reconsider. Why did you want to get stuck on a boat with a bunch of obnoxious people and their sticky children anyway? &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As you age, tuning into your body becomes more important than ever. &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/age" target="_blank"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that cancer rates steadily increase with age—from fewer than 26 cases per 100,000 individuals under 20, to roughly 350 per 100,000 people aged 45 to 49, to over 1,000 per 100,000 in individuals 60 and over. That’s why incorporating healthy habits into your lifestyle is not a question—it’s an essential.

&lt;p&gt;Daily movement can work wonders for your mind, body, and soul, but ensuring it’s serving its core purpose is critical. That means blending together two key forms of exercise: cardio and strength training.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;“By age 40, I recommend adopting structured daily physical activity that integrates both aerobic and resistance-based exercise,” says &lt;b&gt;Christopher R. Cogle, M.D.&lt;/b&gt;, a board-certified oncologist, Board Member at Complement 1, and &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://hemonc.medicine.ufl.edu/profile/cogle-christopher/" target="_blank"&gt;professor at University of Florida&lt;/a&gt; in the MD-HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY department. “This could be as simple as 30 minutes of walking most days a week. Epidemiological &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6527123/" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; consistently link regular physical activity to lower incidence of multiple cancers, including breast, colorectal, endometrial, and prostate cancers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, exercise decreases chronic low-grade inflammation, improves insulin sensitivity, and boosts immune surveillance through improved natural killer (NK) cell activity—all of which are associated with cancer development, Dr. Cogle adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“[This stage of life is] when biological aging processes, such as genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, and immunosenescence, begin to accelerate,” Dr. Cogle tells us. “This is also when the cumulative effects of subclinical metabolic dysfunction, environmental exposures, and lifestyle behaviors start to manifest in measurable physiologic decline. Early intervention at this stage can alter the arc of these processes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing healthy habits shouldn’t stop at your workout routine. Lifestyle factors such as diet, alcohol usage, and sleep should be addressed as well.&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These factors modulate key biological pathways that either promote or inhibit carcinogenesis,” Dr. Cogle explains. “For example, diets high in processed foods, added sugars, and saturated fats promote insulin resistance and oxidative stress. Conversely, diets rich in fiber, phytonutrients, and healthy fats (such as those in a plant-forward diet) reduce systemic inflammation and improve gut microbiome diversity, which is linked to immune health and cancer prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cogle specifically recommends consuming a plant-forward diet that’s rich in omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, antioxidants, and polyphenols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, you may want to limit alcohol consumption, as it can disrupt hormones and &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/diet-physical-activity/alcohol-use-and-cancer.html" target="_blank"&gt;increase your risk of certain cancers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure your bedtime routine is primed for a solid night’s rest, as chronic sleep issues mess with the circadian regulation of cell division and DNA repair, heightening your cancer risk. Ensure your sleep space is cool and dark and you limit blue light usage before hitting the sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            A 59-year-old man arrived at the Peking University First Hospital in Beijing for a procedure when he started having severe &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/18/us/plane-heart-attack-cardiologist"&gt;chest pain&lt;/a&gt; and shortness of breath.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Four months earlier, he had cancerous tumors removed from his bladder. Around his family, he tried his best to appear strong and avoided discussions of his health. Privately, his severe anxiety over the possibility of a cancer recurrence kept him awake at night.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx745600033j6ni26df8rp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors said the man was experiencing takotsubo cardiomyopathy — also known as broken heart syndrome, as documented in a &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2021/11120/cardiogenic_shock_caused_by_takotsubo_syndrome.37.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;2021 case study&lt;/a&gt;. The rare stress-induced heart condition has been observed primarily in women, but a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.124.037219" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the Journal of the American Heart Association in May found that the illness may be more deadly for the men who get it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx745600043j6n43ho2t87@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Thought to be caused by extreme emotional or physical events — such as learning about the death of a loved one, winning the lottery or lifting a heavy sofa — &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/takotsubo-cardiomyopathy-broken-heart-syndrome" target="_blank"&gt;takotsubo cardiomyopathy&lt;/a&gt;, or TC, occurs when the heart muscle is flooded with stress hormones, causing part of it to “freeze” in place. As the heart struggles to properly pump blood, symptoms resemble those of a heart attack, including chest pain, heart palpitations and irregular heartbeat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx745600053j6nu8l3ozos@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new study analyzed data from nearly 200,000 patients hospitalized for TC in the United States between 2016 and 2020. While women accounted for 83% of the cases, men were more than twice as likely to die from the condition — with a mortality rate of 11.2%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx745600063j6nhl7fwnni@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The differences between men and women are a very striking finding,” said study coauthor Dr. Mohammad Reza Movahed, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of Arizona in Tucson. “It raises a new, interesting question that should really be studied.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx745600073j6nidayie0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Similar to differences between men’s and women’s cardiovascular health more generally, the discrepancies in TC death rates are not well understood, Movahed said, especially because they &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590093519300256#:~:text=Although%20the%20incidence%20of%20CVD%20in%20women%20is,heart%20disease%2C%20stroke%2C%20heart%20failure%20and%20aortic%20diseases." target="_blank"&gt;counter&lt;/a&gt; trends in other heart diseases. It’s widely theorized, however, that differences in hormone levels play a role.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx745600083j6niwawtqos@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Stressful situations trigger the adrenal glands to release our fight-or-flight hormones, called catecholamines. They are meant to increase our blood pressure and raise our heart rate, but extreme levels can temporarily “stun” cells in the heart’s tissue, leading to TC, Movahed explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx745600093j6nz2euge9w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Men are thought to produce more catecholamines during stressful situations compared with women, possibly leading men to present with &lt;a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/full/10.1016/j.jacc.2020.03.030" target="_blank"&gt;more severe&lt;/a&gt; cases of TC, he suggested.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx7456000a3j6n73aw8tew@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Estrogen, a sex hormone produced at higher levels in women, may also have a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9330499/" target="_blank"&gt;protective effect&lt;/a&gt; on the cardiovascular system, making it easier to manage an extreme influx of catecholamines and reducing the risk of severe complications from TC, said Dr. Louis Vincent, a noninvasive-cardiology research fellow at the University of Miami, who coauthored a similar&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;multiyear&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34711393/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; investigating discrepancies in men and women who had TC. Vincent was not involved in the new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx7456000b3j6n0ku2gtsr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Beyond biological differences, social factors may play a role as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx7456000c3j6n6pav4cvn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most (physicians) know about takotsubo, but they may think of it as a disease just affecting women, so the diagnosis might be overlooked in men,” said Dr. Deepak Bhatt, a cardiologist and the director of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital who was not involved in the study. “With misdiagnosis, care is delayed, and that can sometimes lead to worse outcomes.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx7456000d3j6ncheptnwl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Men may also seek care at a later stage of illness, believing that their symptoms are manageable or may pass, said Dr. Alejandro Lemor, an assistant professor of interventional cardiology at the University of Mississippi Medical Center who was also not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx7456000e3j6nc811hwkl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Deadly complications from TC include blood clots, stroke, cardiac arrest and heart failure, Lemor said. If the condition is caught early, medications can reduce the risk of having these complications, restore proper heart function and allow for full recovery within weeks, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx7456000f3j6nn5w8xmr4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Movahed’s team was able to factor for important variables like age, race, income, chronic lung disease, hypertension and diabetes in the findings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx7456000g3j6ntzgtrl17@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, there was no patient data on other comorbid diseases, such as a history of stroke or the presence of a Covid-19 infection, Vincent said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx7456000h3j6nbef7s07c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, the new study included in-patient diagnostic data only for those hospitalized with TC, so those who received outpatient care or died later from complications outside the hospital were likely not counted in the analysis, Movahed noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx7456000i3j6nkvdgaheg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To establish a firmer explanation for the differences in mortality rates between men and women and further test treatment methods, a more detailed dataset would be needed, Vincent said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “People should be aware in studies like this, we’re presenting findings that are based on diagnostic codes, and we’re not looking at patient procedures or lab results,” Vincent said. “But it’s powerful in the sense that it lets us look at large populations and look at trends. And I think that this trend of a higher mortality in men is worth taking a deeper look into.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Sudden, severe chest pain or shortness of breath should always be treated as a medical emergency, warned Bhatt, who is also a professor of cardiovascular medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “It’s not a time to tough it out at home or get on the internet to figure it out. … Don’t try to track down your primary care provider. Call emergency services,” Bhatt said. “Time matters. By winning those few hours, you could save yourself irreparable damage to your heart.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Symptoms following physical stressors — a common cause of TC in men — should not be ignored, Movahed said, especially preceding medical events such as asthma attacks, seizures or complications from drug use.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            And while TC is caused by sudden stress, Bhatt said that managing chronic stress with daily meditation or exercise can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/15/health/exercise-stress-heart-disease-study-wellness/index.html"&gt;better cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt; overall while giving you routines to fall back on in unexpected situations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Is this true?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Ellie Cannon replies: &lt;/span&gt;There is some evidence that fish oil – which contains omega-3 – can lower the risk of dementia, but there are other, more important, steps that should be taken to avoid the brain disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is still unclear why dementia – the most common form of which is Alzheimer’s – occurs. And there are no effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But there is strong evidence that certain lifestyle changes can drastically reduce the chances of a diagnosis in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, according to the Lancet Commission, a group of dementia researchers who regularly publish a report setting out the steps patients can take to avoid the disease, nearly half of cases are preventable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;There is some evidence that fish oil – which contains omega-3 – can lower the risk of dementia, but there are other, more important, steps that should be taken to avoid the brain disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their research shows that not smoking, cutting down on excessive &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-3d941ea0-4399-11f0-a14d-17cdeee9968b"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; consumption, losing weight, regularly exercising and socialising (to promote brain stimulation) can all lower the risk of a diagnosis, as can reducing cholesterol levels and tackling high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If necessary, getting a hearing aid and effective glasses also help to protect patients from dementia, as they prevent the brain from straining itself and people feel more able to socialise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is growing evidence that a Mediterranean diet also &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-5686719/Mediterranean-diet-delay-Alzheimers-onset-three-years-study-finds.html"&gt;lowers the chance of dementia&lt;/a&gt;. This involves eating plenty of fruit and vegetables while avoiding processed foods and excessive amounts of red meat. It also includes an ample amount of oily fish, meaning omega-3 – long-linked with improved brain function – is also crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And it is true that getting omega-3 from a supplement is just as healthy as it is from eating fish. However, the Mediterranean diet and omega-3 are not included in the Lancet Commission’s list of anti-dementia steps to take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there are no downsides to taking a daily supplement of the ‘healthy fat’, patients who want to avoid dementia should focus on larger lifestyle changes such as those suggested above by the Lancet Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;I recently had radiotherapy for prostate cancer. It has left me with bowel and bladder problems but I feel too embarrassed to see my GP. What would you advise?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Ellie replies: &lt;/span&gt;Unfortunately, bowel and bladder problems are common side-effects of prostate radiotherapy, but there are ways to manage them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The prostate gland – where semen is produced – is close to the bowel and bladder, so radiotherapy can damage them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-1510b880-4399-11f0-a14d-17cdeee9968b" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14789999/Truth-taking-fish-oil-protect-brain-DR-ELLIE.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;My gut was right about juice diet &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I’ve always been sceptical of so-called juice cleanses, where you consume nothing but blended fruit and vegetables, supposedly to flush out toxins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The idea, which has long been popular on social media, has always seemed far-fetched. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now a study shows that not only are these diets useless, they can actually be harmful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Italian researchers studied the impact of a three-day juice cleanse on volunteers, and by the end they had higher levels of gut bacteria associated with inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This suggests that the juice cleanses disrupted the microbiome – the billions of bacteria in the gut – and may even damage the stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could be because fruit and vegetable juices are high in sugar and acid, which can be harmful to the stomach’s lining. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Have you ever fallen ill as a result of a juice cleanse? Please use the email address below to let me know. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common symptoms are diarrhoea, excessive wind, pain and bleeding in the back passage, as well as urinary and faecal incontinence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For many men, symptoms settle down within a few months of finishing treatment, but for some they can persist longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is important that patients who experience these symptoms see a doctor as they may be unrelated to the radiotherapy. For example, bleeding from the rectum can be a sign of an infection or even bowel cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are drugs that GPs can prescribe to control diarrhoea and slow bowel movements. They can also refer patients to a local continence service with nurses who care for people with bowel problems. This might involve suggesting lifestyle changes – for example, eating low-fibre foods such as white rice and potatoes to reduce the urgency of bowel movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are also exercises that patients can do to improve their urinary incontinence. If these steps fail, nurses can provide incontinence pads that hide the issue. Bowel problems can feel embarrassing and often lead to social isolation as patients worry about leaving the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;My eye is bleeding and very painful. Painkiller drops don’t seem to help. What should I do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Ellie replies: &lt;/span&gt;Anyone with bleeding from the eye or severe pain there should urgently see a specialist, as their vision may be at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the most common causes of eye bleeds is a vitreous haemorrhage (blood vessels bursting) but this is not usually painful. Instead, patients experience issues such as floaters – small dark spots in the vision. An optician or ophthalmologist can check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Glaucoma (one of the most common causes of sight loss) can trigger eye pain but not usually bleeding. This is when the optic nerve connecting the eye and brain is damaged, leading to sight loss. It usually takes time but acute angle closure glaucoma can take just days, causes severe eye pain and requires urgent medical attention to avoid sight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another issue that causes severe eye pain is optic neuritis – an inflammation of the nerve at the back of the eye that can be an early sign of the progressive autoimmune condition multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it is also caused by a virus, such as shingles, and if left untreated can lead to blindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-f5d25e60-4398-11f0-a14d-17cdeee9968b" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14789999/Truth-taking-fish-oil-protect-brain-DR-ELLIE.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;Would you recognise signs of a mini-stroke? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Knowing the signs of a mini-stroke is vital, but too few people seem to be aware of what that are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also known as a transient ischemic attack, it occurs when blood is blocked from reaching the brain, but unlike a full-blown stroke the blockage is only temporary and doesn’t cause permanent brain damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The symptoms of a mini-stroke include altered speech, limb weakness, dizziness, confusion and severe headaches, and anyone who experiences one must go to hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the authors of a US study have suggested some put off seeing a doctor – or don’t seek help at all – because the effects are temporary. This is worrying because not only are these patients at greater risk of a full-blown stroke, they also have a raised risk of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Have you suffered a mini-stroke?
