            As measles cases in the United States continue to mount, neighboring countries Canada and Mexico are also experiencing significant outbreaks – all of which have been linked to at least one death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu100043b6mb9pf6us4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Thursday, the chief medical officer of health of the Canadian province Ontario announced that an infant who was born prematurely with a measles infection had died.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu100053b6m5hkds6gw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The infant contracted the virus before birth from their mother, who had not received the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine,” Dr. Kieran Moore said in a &lt;a href="https://news.ontario.ca/en/statement/1006004/statement-from-the-chief-medical-officer-of-health" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “While measles may have been a contributing factor in both the premature birth and death, the infant also faced other serious medical complications unrelated to the virus.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu100063b6mg87spso6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At least four people have died from measles in Mexico in 2025, and three people have died in the US: two children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico, all of whom were unvaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu100073b6mqg2lad0v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This years’ measles outbreaks are the biggest that Canada and Mexico have seen in decades, and the World Health Organization has &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON565" target="_blank"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; that the “overall risk of measles in the Americas Region is considered high.” Low vaccination rates are a key driver of this elevated risk assessment, the agency said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu100083b6m3ec1ydi9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mexico has reported at least 1,520 measles cases as of late May, according to &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/documents/measles-rubella-bi-weekly-bulletin-19-20-17-may-2025" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the Pan American Health Organization.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu100093b6m5v0pcgpr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Canada reached measles elimination status in 1998, meaning that there has not been continuous spread of the virus for more than a year. But there have already been more cases reported so far this year than there were in the previous 27 years combined. At least 2,755 measles cases have been reported in Canada so far this year, according to federal &lt;a href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; that was last updated on Monday, the vast majority of those which have been in Ontario residents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu1000a3b6mx5wzf84c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And the US has reported at least 1,168 measles cases so far this year, according to federal &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; published Friday – nearly 80% of which are associated with an outbreak centered in West Texas that has spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma and possibly Canada. It’s the second highest number of cases that the US has reported since achieving measles elimination status in 2000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu1000b3b6m3627dng5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Significant shares of the measles outbreaks in the US, Canada and Mexico have been concentrated in Mennonite communities that are closely connected to each other – and that have historically had low vaccination rates due largely to minimal interactions with formal health care systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu1000c3b6mcqzuxgwj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, in a recent webinar, experts from the Pan American Health Organization did not formally link outbreaks in the three countries to each other.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu1000d3b6macxlntjo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The outbreak [in Mexico] started in Chihuahua, at the heart of Mennonite communities, who were very close to Texas through the border, but they’re also close to other Mennonite communities in Canada,” Dr. Alvaro Whittembury, regional adviser for the Comprehensive Immunization Special Program, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/events/webinar-between-urgency-and-resilience-culturally-aware-strategies-address-measles-outbreaks" target="_blank"&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday. “It’s important to show that although at first the outbreak starts in Mennonite communities … the vast majority of cases are outside of these communities, and they are sustained in the general population.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu1000e3b6mxhyd4lgf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Only a small share of confirmed cases in the Americas have identified genetic sequences, experts from the Pan American Health Organization said, and there haven’t been enough identical sequences to explicitly link cases across countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu1000f3b6m6mn6qfp1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In April, Mexico issued a &lt;a href="https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/992760/APV-EEUU-EEUU-CANADA-Sarampion_20250425_english.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt; for people traveling to the US and Canada due to high measles case rates. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also stepped up its guidance for travelers, advising that anyone traveling internationally should be vaccinated with two doses of the MMR vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu1000g3b6m7h3t18vo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Anyone who is unvaccinated is at risk and I urge everyone, but especially those who may become pregnant, to ensure they have received two doses of the MMR vaccine, which will protect both a parent and baby,” Moore said in his statement Thursday. “This vaccine has been safely used for over 50 years and is highly effective. Two doses provide nearly 100 per cent protection.”

						&lt;p&gt;A tool that grew in popularity during the
COVID-19 pandemic might help communities track the flow of measles nationwide. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Wastewater monitoring can serve as an “early warning
system,” according to North Carolina environmental engineer Angela Harris. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes people are spreading these pathogens in their
urine or their stool, prior to exhibiting symptoms,” Harris explained. “If you’re
only doing clinical testing of people who are symptomatic, it’s going to be a
bit delayed.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Harris, an associate professor at NC State, worked closely
with the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services amid early research
efforts during the SARS Co-V-2 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“When we were thinking about, ‘How can we help with this
response, and how can we address transmission?’ – wastewater is a really nice
sample type that allows us to look at community level exposures,” Harris explained. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Harris said every pathogen is different. The researcher
noted measles, for example, is shed through urine and not stool.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/how-wws-works.html"&gt;Wastewater
has been used as a helpful tool to look for other viruses&lt;/a&gt; including polio
and influenza, and for looking at widespread drug use. &lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/toilets-early-warning-measles-outbreak-nc-june-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The researcher noted data from water treatment facilities has
proven to be particularly helpful for hospital systems – as exhibited during the
pandemic – when making  “decisions about
elective procedures so they would have space for a rising outbreak, or surge in
cases.”&lt;/p&gt;

measles across the Untied States.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The online tool offers another way to track the flow of
measles as confirmed cases hit 1,168 across 34 jurisdictions, as of June 5,
2025. At least 89% of cases have been linked to 17 different outbreaks this
year.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;All states bordering North Carolina, except for South
Carolina, have now reported at least one case of measles in the last few
months. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Harris cautioned the system isn’t without its flaws, as she
noted it is more reliable when several people within a community are sick with
the same infectious disease. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/toilets-early-warning-measles-outbreak-nc-june-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/toilets-early-warning-measles-outbreak-nc-june-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Say there are
100,000 people contributing to a wastewater treatment plant,” Harris explained.
“If just one of those people is infected, we’d have a very low probability of
detecting it in wastewater. But, if you had more people infected, say 100
people, you’d be maybe 50% likely to detect it in wastewater.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The researcher also said monitoring specific facilities,
such as individual schools, hospitals, or nursing homes, could also help
provide more detailed information about a particular viral spread. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Certain buildings will have one pipe of sewage that goes to
the main line, so you can install sampling devices within a network,” Harris said. “One neighborhood – all of their waste may be funneled to a single
point in the sewer network – so you could install a sampling device pretty
easily at a pump station.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Harris noted data from specific facilities would also help
health departments in planning strategic and targeted community outreach
efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“If you are doing wastewater surveillance and you see certain
disease trends, vaccination campaigns can be quite effective in expanding
vaccination coverage to reduce transmission likelihood,” Harris said. “Schools
are another way to reach populations. If we see certain things in wastewater,
then health departments can work with schools to deliver information and to
offer vaccination campaigns.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Reducing spread among school populations is of particular
concern among health officials when it comes to measles. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The virus is highly contagious and can be particularly
dangerous for children. The CDC warns two out of the three confirmed deaths from
measles so far in 2025 were children. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;67% of the total cases reported across 33 states as of June
5 were in children under 19, with 95% of total cases occurring in patients who
were unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/lifestyle/health/nc-hospitals-standby-measles-threat-may-2025/"&gt;North
Carolina hospitals are on high alert amid growing concerns of a potential
measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Two doses of the measles vaccine are about 97% effective when
protecting against measles, mumps, and rubella, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/toilets-early-warning-measles-outbreak-nc-june-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/toilets-early-warning-measles-outbreak-nc-june-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of the virus include fever, cough, runny nose, and
red, watery eyes. A red, blotchy rash may also appear throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Harris notes wastewater surveillance will likely be a useful
tool for health departments statewide moving forward who need to track community
spread of measles. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“It can also be helpful if we have limited case data,” Harris added. “If there is some sort of stigma around going and reporting that you
are sick, or if there is not great access to healthcare services in some areas,
this wastewater surveillance allows us to collect data that may not have the
same access to health care or to testing as other populations.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;North Carolina is one of only six states involved in the
National Wastewater Surveillance System through the CDC. Data collected is used
to help drive innovation and help researchers detect infectious diseases across
the country.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Liam's mother Ashlee (pictured together) said the pain was 'indescribable' as she lay with him after the medical team turned off life support&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Talking about the subsequent events, Ashlee told this website: 'We were hoping for a miracle and kept him on life support so that family and friends could visit for the next two days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'With no improvements, we took him off of life support on Monday, April 28, and he passed peacefully at 3.35pm.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14673485/child-flu-deaths-highest-swine-flu-outbreak-cdc.html"&gt;its similar-sounding name,&lt;/a&gt; haemophilus influenzae is not a flu virus but a bacterium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While many healthy people carry it in their nose or throat without symptoms, H. flu can turn lethal if it enters the bloodstream, causing the body to attack organs. It is particularly dangerous for young children, whose immune systems are still developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;H. flu is now rare due to widespread Hib vaccination, which has brought yearly cases in the US down from 20,000 in the 1980s to just 50 today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, vaccine uptake has been dropping since the Covid pandemic and doctors warn that it could make a deadly resurgence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liam was one of those rare cases. The vaccine — given over three doses to babies — is about 95 per cent effective at preventing infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although he was fully vaccinated as part of routine childhood immunizations, Liam fell into that small group for whom the vaccine isn't fully protective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Little Liam Dahlberg, eight, from Indiana , complained of a headache after coming home from school last month — the next day he was dead &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infectious disease doctors told Ashlee they believed that her son caught Hib from the cough or sneeze of an unvaccinated child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Being vaccinated limits your chances of contracting the disease and at the same time limits the carriage of the disease,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So, basically in order to not see this disease to this extent, everyone should be vaccinated for it because then it would be eradicated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's not impossible for a vaccinated child to be carrying the bacteria but a vaccinated child would not spread the disease to this extent of being fatal unless an unvaccinated child contracted the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is why you don't see it very often because there are more vaccinated children than unvaccinated - but it's the unvaccinated that essentially destroying herd immunity.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The exact source of Liam's infection will never be known for certain but doctors said the timeline suggested exposure happened between April 22 and April 24.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now the family is sharing his devastating case in the hope of raising awareness about Hib - and the importance of maintaining high levels of childhood vaccination rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They don't just protect you they protect others who may not be able to be vaccinated and who may have weakened immune systems,' Ashlee said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;He was diagnosed with haemophilus influenzae, also known as H. flu , which had spread to his brain and spinal cord &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The family is still unsure how Liam caught the infection — he had been fully vaccinated against H.flu as part of his routine childhood schedule&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pediatricians have warned of declining vaccine uptake overall in the years since the Covid-19 pandemic, though there is no detailed data as to the fall in rates for children when it comes to H. flu. Misinformation and political polarization are thought to be playing a part. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But there may be other reasons fewer children received shots this year, Dr Sean O'Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics said, citing reduced access to services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many pediatricians offices were understaffed and not holding as many after-hours vaccination clinics as in the past. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also, more Americans were seeking their vaccinations from pharmacies but some drugstores don't vaccinate children, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a GoFundMe page set up to help cover the medical costs that have amounted to $300,000, the Dahlbergs described Liam as 'a bright and smart young boy, full of life and potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'His presence brought joy and warmth to everyone he met,' the page adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientists believe this will help empower patients to better understand their disease and work more easily with their healthcare team to make disease management decisions. The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-63888-x"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Performance of machine learning models for predicting high-severity symptoms in multiple sclerosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MS, the immune system erroneously attacks healthy parts of the brain and spinal cord. Disease symptoms and severity can vary widely depending on which regions are most affected, and the extent of the damage. Typically, people with MS have clinical assessments a couple times a year, along with an annual &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-diagnosis/mri-magnetic-resonance-imaging/"&gt;MRI scan&lt;/a&gt;, but these infrequent snapshots may not be enough to fully capture how it’s impacting their life between visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital monitoring tools like smartphone apps could fill this gap and enable collection of a wide range of data on a daily basis. In turn, AI algorithms can analyze the data and make predictions about disease progression to aid clinical decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mobile technology enables continual collection of data and can pave the path for predicting complex aspects of MS such as symptoms and disease courses,” the researchers wrote. “We might learn what symptoms MS subjects are likely to develop, why they are experiencing the ones they have, and what treatments are more suited for their current disease burden.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Helping patients manage their disease&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An observational study called &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02845635"&gt;MS Mosaic (NCT02845635)&lt;/a&gt; was initiated to collect data from adults with MS in the U.S. via a mobile app over three years. The app was developed by scientists at Duke University in North Carolina and was made available for download during the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants completed tasks that included demographic surveys, daily MS symptom reporting, and other active functional tests. The smartphone also passively collected data related to step counts, sleep, and heart rate. The researchers then partnered with Google data scientists to develop AI algorithms that would continuously predict when symptoms might occur. The analyses included data from 713 people who used the app for at least three months, most of whom had MS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientists tested several different approaches to predict on a weekly basis if a person would have any of five MS symptoms — &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/fatigue-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt;, sensory disturbances, walking instability, &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-and-mental-health/"&gt;depression or anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and muscle cramps or spasms — with at least moderate severity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team honed in on one type of algorithm that had the best predictive abilities, with a diagnostic accuracy between 80%-90% for each symptom. This model was particularly accurate considering all the evaluated features collected from the smartphone, but what seemed most important for predicting future symptoms was a past history of that symptom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When that feature was removed from the algorithm, its predictive abilities declined, though it could still achieve a fairly high performance by looking at the totality of other data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This highlights the importance of considering all available data collectively, which proves the need for methods that can analyze a wide range of data simultaneously,” wrote the researchers, noting an app-based method for predicting MS symptoms showed it could give patients more certainty in their daily lives. “Symptomatic uncertainties associated with MS can have a substantial impact on quality of life, as individuals struggle to anticipate how they will feel each day, whether their symptoms will impede daily tasks, or know if particular symptoms originate from their MS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By focusing on actionable prediction of high-severity symptoms, the algorithm described here could improve anticipatory guidance and symptom management,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if a person knows their ability to walk might soon decline, they can consider &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/physiotherapy/"&gt;physical therapy&lt;/a&gt; or other interventions before this happens. The app was designed to provide patients with a symptom summary report that may facilitate such conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, “this approach has the potential to empower subjects as experts of their own experience in order to improve symptom management, and to optimize the often-limited interactions with physicians and clinical experts,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But it’s been courting controversy for years with products that claim to tell people how their genetics correlate to a host of complex issues, including their IQ. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Wednesday, it ratcheted up the controversy to an earsplitting level when it announced a new product called Nucleus Embryo &lt;a href="https://x.com/nucleusgenomics/status/1930293851383615752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;with a tweet&lt;/a&gt; that said: “Every parent wants to give their children more than they had. For the first time in human history, Nucleus adds a new tool to that commitment.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nucleus says it can test IVF embryos not just for well-known specific genes that have a high chance of illnesses like breast cancer, but also for appearance — sex, height, hair color, eye color — as well as IQ and complex health attributes like anxiety and ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The launch video includes a screenshot of a comparison menu. The idea is to help parents choose which embryos to pick and which ones to, perhaps, discard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Genetic testing of embryos isn’t unheard of. IVF physicians &lt;a href="https://www.froedtert.com/fertility/genetic-screening/pgd-chromosomal-abnormalities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;can test for&lt;/a&gt; genes that can cause conditions like Down syndrome, or when parents know they are of high risk for a particular genetic disorder, like cystic fibrosis. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But that’s not exactly what Nucleus is doing. It is using controversial “polygenic scores” to determine “complex genetic outcomes, like intelligence and anxiety,” a spokesperson says. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to the National Human Genome Research Institute, polygenic scores only calculate the probabilities of a certain complex illness occurring, mainly within populations. “A polygenic risk score can only explain the relative risk for a disease,” &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/Health/Genomics-and-Medicine/Polygenic-risk-scores" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;the NHGR says&lt;/a&gt;. This is not the same as discovering a specific gene, such as the BRCA1 gene mutation, which gives a person a 60% to 80% “absolute risk of breast cancer,” the NHGR says. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There’s a reason doctors don’t typically use such tests for individuals. “Polygenic risk scores are not yet routinely used by health professionals because there are no guidelines for practice and researchers are still improving how these scores are generated,” according to the NHGR.  &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nucleus defends that its method can be used to determine an individual’s risk. The spokesperson pointed us to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0183-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;a 2018 paper&lt;/a&gt; where the authors said they had developed validated methods for five common diseases: coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That paper was advocating screenings to help individuals make lifestyle or therapeutic decisions, similar to Nucleus’s initial concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Wednesday’s tweet was promising parents that Nucleus can help them create designer babies. It has now been viewed more than 4 million times and has hundreds of comments, many of them either expressing disbelief that this works as promised, or horror at the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One &lt;a href="https://x.com/maxniederhofer/status/1930551749531574421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;VC chimed&lt;/a&gt; into the discussion saying, “I was going to type something like Noah get the boat but honestly the reality of this just makes me so nauseous.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nucleus has experienced this kind of controversy before, as &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/controversial-genetics-testing-startup-nucleus-genomics-raises-14m-series-a/"&gt;TechCrunch previously reported&lt;/a&gt;, when it announced its $14 million Series A earlier this year. The startup is backed by Founders Fund; Alexis Ohanian’s 776; &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/15/nucleus-genomics-lands-new-funding-from-alexis-ohanian-to-help-people-assess-specific-disease-risks/?guccounter=1"&gt;and angels, including&lt;/a&gt; Adrian Aoun (CEO at Forward Health), Brent Saunders (former CEO at Allergan), and Matteo Franceschetti (CEO at Eight Sleep).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Last year, Sadeghi launched Nucleus IQ, which is supposed to tell users how much their genetics influence intelligence. The product was blasted &lt;a href="https://nepc.colorado.edu/blog/genetic-iq-tests#:~:text=On%20the%20ethical%20side%2C%20too,race%20as%20a%20biological%20category." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;as “bad science and big business”&lt;/a&gt; by some critics. Sadeghi &lt;a href="https://nucleusgenomics.substack.com/p/genetics-can-predict-height-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;published a lengthy defense &lt;/a&gt;of his company’s methodology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even so, telling adults that they are genetically smart is one thing. Telling IVF parents that they can choose the appearance and other complex attributes for their children is, &lt;a href="https://x.com/nucleusgenomics/status/1930293851383615752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;many would argue&lt;/a&gt;, something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nucleus &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/embryo-ivf-screening-longevity-2b1f096a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;is not currently conducting such tests via IVF lab partners&lt;/a&gt; itself, The Wall Street Journal reports. It’s partnering with Genomic Prediction, which works with IVF clinics. A Genomic executive told the WSJ that many parents request intelligence tests, and it doesn’t provide that. Parents can voluntarily upload genetic data information to Nucleus if they want to pursue it. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Or, as Sadeghi said in the launch video aimed at would-be parents: “Not that long ago, IVF-1 sparked fear and the stigma of test tube babies,” he said. “What was once controversial is now an everyday practice. The same is true with genetic optimization. The technology is now here and it’s here to stay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

But beyond its culinary charm, rosemary is also &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/266370"&gt;gaining recognition&lt;/a&gt; for its impressive health benefits, especially when it comes to brain health, inflammation and immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/rosemary-compound-enhances-brain-connections-and-memory-in-alzheimers-model/"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; rosemary may even &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-45168-1"&gt;hold promise&lt;/a&gt; in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease, the leading cause of &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia"&gt;dementia worldwide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, rosemary has been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8851910/"&gt;linked to memory and mental clarity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://daily.jstor.org/rosemary-the-herb-of-ritual-and-remembrance/"&gt;In ancient Greece and Rome&lt;/a&gt;, students and scholars used rosemary in the hope of sharpening concentration and recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern science is finding there may have been something in this: &lt;a href="https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/news-events/news/2016/04/herbs-that-can-boost-your-mood-and-memory/"&gt;in one study&lt;/a&gt;, people who inhaled rosemary’s scent performed better on memory tasks compared to those in an unscented environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how does rosemary work on the brain? There are several mechanisms at play. For starters, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7491497/"&gt;rosemary stimulates&lt;/a&gt; blood circulation, including to the brain, helping deliver more oxygen and nutrients, which may improve mental clarity. It also has calming properties; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9297920/"&gt;some studies suggest&lt;/a&gt; its aroma can reduce anxiety and improve sleep. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7879075/"&gt;Lower stress can mean&lt;/a&gt; better focus and memory retention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosemary contains compounds that &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/6/1547"&gt;interact with the brain’s neurotransmitters&lt;/a&gt;. One such compound, 1,8-cineole, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2045125312436573"&gt;helps prevent the breakdown&lt;/a&gt; of acetylcholine, a brain chemical essential for learning and memory. By preserving acetylcholine, rosemary &lt;a href="https://www.ijpsjournal.com/article/Therapeutic+Effect+of+Rosemary+and+Its+Active+Constituent+on+Nervous+System+Disorders++"&gt;may help support cognitive performance&lt;/a&gt;, especially as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another bonus? Rosemary is &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/10/5/714"&gt;packed with antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;, which help protect brain cells from damage caused by oxidative stress – a major factor in cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosemary is rich in phytochemicals, plant compounds with health-enhancing effects. One of the most powerful is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661824002330"&gt;carnosic acid&lt;/a&gt;, an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7491497/"&gt;helps shield brain cells from harm&lt;/a&gt;, particularly from the kinds of damage linked to Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2025, &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/14/3/293"&gt;researchers developed&lt;/a&gt; a stable version of carnosic acid called diAcCA. In promising pre-clinical studies, this compound improved memory, boosted the number of synapses (the connections between brain cells), and reduced harmful Alzheimer’s related proteins like amyloid-beta and tau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s especially exciting is that diAcCA only activates in inflamed brain regions, which could minimise side effects. So far, studies in mice show no signs of toxicity and significant cognitive improvements – raising hopes that human trials could be next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also believe diAcCA could help treat other inflammatory conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Beyond brain health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosemary’s benefits could extend &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7491497/#B5"&gt;well beyond the brain&lt;/a&gt;. It’s been used traditionally to ease digestion, relieve bloating and reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compounds like rosmarinic acid and ursolic acid are known for their anti-inflammatory effects throughout the body. Rosemary may even benefit the skin – &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10045493/"&gt;a review suggests&lt;/a&gt; it can help soothe acne and eczema, while carnosic acid may offer anti-ageing benefits by protecting skin from sun damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6165352/"&gt;Rosemary oil&lt;/a&gt; also has antimicrobial properties, showing promise in food preservation and potential pharmaceutical applications by inhibiting the growth of bacteria and fungi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, rosemary is &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/266370#safety"&gt;safe when used&lt;/a&gt; in food, teas or aromatherapy. But concentrated doses or extracts can pose risks. &lt;a href="https://reference.medscape.com/drug/old-man-rosmarinus-officinalis-linn-rosemary-344476#4"&gt;Consuming large amounts&lt;/a&gt; may cause vomiting or, in rare cases, seizures – particularly in people with epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also a &lt;a href="https://reference.medscape.com/drug/old-man-rosmarinus-officinalis-linn-rosemary-344476#5"&gt;theoretical risk&lt;/a&gt; of rosemary stimulating uterine contractions, so pregnant people should avoid high doses. Because rosemary &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/rosemary-tea#Potential-drug-interactions"&gt;can interact with some medications&lt;/a&gt; – such as blood thinners – it’s best to check with a healthcare provider before taking large amounts in supplement form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosemary is more than just a kitchen staple. It’s a natural remedy with ancient roots and modern scientific backing. As research continues, particularly into breakthrough compounds like diAcCA, rosemary could play an exciting role in future treatments for Alzheimer’s and other chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, adding a little rosemary to your life – whether in a meal, a cup of tea, or a breath of its fragrant oil – could be a small step with big health benefits.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256920/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256920/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the researchers observed that dementia was more likely to develop among those who had been &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-tests-diagnosis/"&gt;diagnosed with Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt; for a longer duration at the time of the surgical procedure. This was found regardless of the patients’ ages, sex, or level of education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Disease duration, but not presurgical MCI [mild cognitive impairment] was associated with development of dementia,” the team wrote, noting that “influence on cognition” was detailed in “a short- and long-term follow-up study up to 15 years” following DBS surgery among patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Titled “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1877718X251334049"&gt;Mild cognitive impairment is not predictive of dementia up to 15 years after subthalamic deep brain stimulation in Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” the study was published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Parkinson’s Disease&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;After DBS, verbal fluency, other cognitive skills seen to decline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In DBS, small electrodes are placed into deep areas of the brain. These electrodes are connected by thin wires to a device called a pulse generator, which sends mild electrical pulses to regulate brain activity and ease the &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/motor/"&gt;motor symptoms&lt;/a&gt; that are a hallmark of Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these symptoms, many people with Parkinson’s experience cognitive changes that often begin as mild cognitive impairment — small but noticeable problems with attention, planning, or memory beyond those of normal aging. When these problems become severe enough to interfere with daily life, doctors refer to it as dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cognitive impairment and dementia are common in [the] later stages of Parkinson’s,” the researchers wrote. However, little is known about the long-term effects of DBS on cognition. Such a study, the team noted, “must take into consideration the progression of disease, as well as the background risk of dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand how DBS affects cognitive function in the long term, the researchers followed 81 patients who had been living with Parkinson’s for an average of 13 years. Half of them already exhibited signs of mild cognitive impairment before surgery, the data showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three months after DBS, all of the patients showed significantly worse verbal fluency, indicated by how quickly they could name words in a certain category or words starting with a specific letter, or switch between types of words. Other cognitive skills also showed some decline, but the changes weren’t large enough to be considered significant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Parkinson’s patients with depression more likely to develop dementia&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 29 patients were followed for up to 15 years. Among them, about two-thirds developed mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Six, or 21%, had signs of cognitive changes but no clinical diagnosis of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four patients — all women — had normal cognitive function. On average, these four were younger at the time of surgery (47.4 years vs. 57.5 years) than the others in the study. They also had Parkinson’s for a shorter duration before surgery (8.5 years vs. 12 years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No link was found between having mild cognitive impairment before surgery and later developing dementia. About 51% of those with early cognitive changes developed dementia, compared with 55% of those who had normal cognitive function before surgery, the data showed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;Disease duration and … depressive symptoms before surgery were associated with the later development of clinically diagnosed dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/living-with-parkinsons-disease-2/"&gt;living with Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt; for a longer time before surgery was linked to a higher likelihood of developing dementia. For each additional year of living with the disease before surgery, the odds of developing dementia later increased by about 20%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before surgery, about a third of patients had symptoms of depression, which may occur as a &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/non-motor/"&gt;nonmotor symptom&lt;/a&gt; of Parkinson’s and be &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/news/parkinsons-depression-linked-with-low-cognitive-function-sex-drive/"&gt;linked to low cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;. Patients with symptoms of depression were more likely to develop dementia later, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Disease duration and … depressive symptoms before surgery were associated with the later development of clinically diagnosed dementia,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a limitation of the study, the researchers noted the “relatively small” number of patients. This, as well as a lack of a control group, “[make] it difficult to draw a conclusion” on all data, the team wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The study is meant to be hypothesis-generating, and results should be further tested in other studies,” the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

The Covid pandemic revealed that the C.D.C.’s &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/us/cdc-coronavirus.html" title=""&gt;data systems were antiquated&lt;/a&gt;, hobbling the country’s response in the crucial early months. A plan to modernize and consolidate the agency’s data systems began during the Biden administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But news that the Trump administration &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/technology/trump-palantir-data-americans.html" title=""&gt;has expanded Palantir’s work&lt;/a&gt; across the federal government in recent months, allowing it to compile detailed information about Americans, has introduced a new layer of anxiety and mistrust among state and local officials about sharing data with the C.D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Palantir’s systems, including those at the C.D.C., &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.palantir.com/newsroom/press-releases/palantir-expands-longstanding-cdc-partnership-for-disease-monitoring-and/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;rely on a platform called Foundry&lt;/a&gt; that could merge information from different agencies. The Department of Health and Human Services, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health all use Foundry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Some officials worry that a sprawling data collection system could expose or endanger people with sensitive health needs, like gender care, reproductive health care or disabilities.

teenager has revealed how she discovered that a lump in her neck she thought was from a lingering cold was actually &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-4a72d4c0-42ec-11f0-82b5-9f8a2ce8202c"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In January 2025, Makaila Chenier, 17, found a 'little lump' in her neck but ignored it - believing it was a swollen lymph node due to a cold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when the lump 'got progressively bigger' months before she was meant to graduate high school and she had trouble breathing while lying down, the teenager decided to visit a doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mikaila's mother, Christina Chenier recalled her daughter saying: 'Look, the lump on my neck has gotten a lot bigger. I can feel it. It's on the other side now, and I feel like I'm being choked when I lay down.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The high school student was referred to an ear, nose and throat specialist, who, after seeing the severity of her situation, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14786781/Healthy-woman-bowel-cancer-young-people-ultraprocessed-food.html"&gt;advised her to quickly go to the emergency department.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There was definitely a sense of urgency that we picked up on very quickly in the appointments,' Christina said. 'We knew something wasn't quite right.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the ED, Makaila underwent an ultrasound, X-ray and CT scan. The tests revealed she was suffering from Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system, an important part of the body's immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The lymphatic system is widespread across the body, it includes bone marrow, the spleen, tonsils and tissue in the small intestine, and Hodgkin lymphoma limits the body's ability to fight infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Makaila Chenier, 17, has revealed how she discovered that a normal post-cold lump in her neck was a sign that she was suffering from Stage 2 Hodgkin lymphoma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mikaila told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://people.com/teen-thought-she-had-swollen-lymph-node-from-cold-turned-out-to-be-cancer-11748698"&gt;PEOPLE&lt;/a&gt;: 'It was very hard because it was like everything changed literally overnight. It was just a little lump.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After being diagnosed with the disease, which is expected to effect 8,700 Americans this year, the teenager was transferred to Texas Children's Hospital where doctors conducted a biopsy of her lymph nodes and uncovered the extent of her cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was stage 2, meaning the cancer was present in two or more groups of lymph nodes that are all on the same side of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The estimated survival rate for stage 2 is between 93 and 95 percent. The American Cancer Society estimates there will be 1,150 deaths from Hodgkin lymphoma this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother added: 'I'm not sure why I thought to look at my watch, but 8:02 pm on Friday, February 18, 2025, will be permanently etched in my memory because that was the moment when everything changed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'All of a sudden we were playing a completely different game and everything was completely upside down.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mikaila was admitted to the intensive care unit because doctors were worried about 'the airway constriction' in her neck due to the lump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Christina said: 'They were concerned that she may have trouble breathing at any point. They felt it was the best place for her.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma include swelling of lymph nodes in the neck, armpits or groin, fever, tiredness, night sweats, weight loss and tiredness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment often involves two to four rounds of chemotherapy and radiation therapy - which doctors advised Mikaila undergo a week and a half after she was diagnosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Makaila pictured here at her graduation with her cat, Walter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In Hodgkin lymphoma, Stage 2 means the cancer is present in two or more groups of lymph nodes that are all on the same side of the body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As of now, the high schooler has finished her seventh round of chemotherapy and has five more to go. Doctors expect her treatment to end by August 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'After the first cycle of chemo, they kept me for two or three days after to monitor and make sure I was responding well,' Makaila told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/teen-mistook-lump-neck-cold-symptom-lymphoma-rcna210888"&gt;TODAY.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She showed no serious reactions after her first round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of now, the teenager has finished her seventh round of chemotherapy and has five more to go. Doctors expect her treatment to end by August 1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is currently receiving infusions every two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to the frequency of her treatment and side effects, Mikaila was forced to drop out of school and is now being homeschooled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'Initially it was a lot of tiredness. I slept probably for the whole next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I get really bad nerve pain in my jaw and my tongue and then I will also get bone pain in my legs.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, there was one milestone the teen didn't want to miss out on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After graduation and chemotherapy, the teen plans to take a gap year before starting college to become a pediatric nurse&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They let me do graduation because that's once in a lifetime,' she told TODAY.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After graduation and chemotherapy, she plans to take a gap year before starting college to become a pediatric nurse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've been staying really positive through it all and I've learned that really helps get through it because they say time flies when you're having fun,' Makaila said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I try to have as much fun as I can and make the best out of it, which has really helped.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;South Shore Health declined to answer questions about whether the health care system was treating suspected cases or how many it was seeing, referring instead to the Department of Public Health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;However Dr. Jason Tracy, chief medical officer at the health system, said generally that patients are given a presumptive diagnosis made off of their clinical presentation of symptoms and history of recent injections. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;From there, the hospital would involve both the Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control, which has an anti-toxin that it provides on a case-by-case basis.

The powerful toxin, produced by a bacteria, blocks the ability of the nervous system to activate muscles. It has become known worldwide for its ability to both soften and prevent wrinkles, and it is the most common cosmetic procedure administered worldwide, with an estimated 3 million injections done annually. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Cosmetic treatments with botulinum toxin use doses much lower than for medical treatments, said Dr. Mathew M. Avram, director of the Mass. General Hospital Dermatology Laser and Cosmetic Center. With regulated, FDA-approved products in a healthy adult, the amount of the toxin is so small that it is exceedingly rare for it to cause botulism. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I’ve never seen a patient or had a colleague of mine at Mass. General or elsewhere that has told me they have had a case of this. It is not something that happens normally,” Avram said. “Someone would have to go outside the realm of what you would typically inject to encounter these issues, for a typical patient.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Beyond injecting far too much, poor administration technique or using counterfeit products can increase risks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We have seen instances where injectors have used counterfeit products or products they developed on their own,” Avram said. “These are unsafe practices that can harm patients.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;According to the advisory, botulism results when the botulinum toxin circulates in the blood. Symptoms including double or blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty breathing. Such symptoms are sometimes followed by muscle weaknesses, which can progress over the course of hours or days. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;DPH has asked clinicians to warn patients interested in these cosmetic injections of the potential risks, and is advising patients to receive injections only from licensed providers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“If someone has had a botox injection and has had those symptoms they should seek medical attention,” Tracy said. “I don’t want to create worry but someone having visual changes, slurred speech and difficulty swallowing — they should not ignore it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The reports are only the latest Botox problems to surface in the South Shore. In November, 38-year-old Rebecca Fadanelli, was arrested and charged with selling counterfeit Botox out of Skin Beauté Med Spa in Easton and Randolph. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/spa-owner-arrested-allegedly-performing-thousands-illegal-counterfeit-injections-clients" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/spa-owner-arrested-allegedly-performing-thousands-illegal-counterfeit-injections-clients"&gt;Prosecutors say&lt;/a&gt; Fandanelli had for years imported counterfeit Botox, Sculptra, and Juvederm from China and Brazil and performed over a thousand injections, receiving over $900,000 in client payments. Though she represented to clients and employees that she was a nurse, prosecutors said she is an aesthetician and wasn’t properly licensed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

            Maybe you have decided that the voice inside your head judging yourself or others for&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;body size can be pretty mean, but at least it’s encouraging weight loss, right?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif00083b6mxjj0onz6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No, it’s not, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif00093b6mgcd4cyow@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There has long been a misunderstanding … that if you shame people about their weight, then that will lead them to eat less or to eat more healthfully or to exercise more in order to lose weight,” said Dr. Rebecca Pearl, associate professor of clinical and health psychology at the University of Florida.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000a3b6mkulgma5z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What the research, though, has shown over and over again is that that is not true,” Pearl said. “It actually has the opposite effect.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000b3b6mptjwuju7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Stigma around weight and body size is everywhere: in US culture, messages from people around you and even at your doctor’s office, Pearl said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000c3b6mpqdmaac0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One study found that after bariatric surgery, experiencing continued weight stigma was associated with higher risks of depression, anxiety and disordered eating such as binge eating. Those who experienced less weight stigma were more likely to continue losing weight and maintain weight loss, according to the &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/hea0001517" target="_blank"&gt;study published Thursday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Health Psychology.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000d3b6me4e2k6kk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And not only are biases around weight damaging to mental health, they also are counterproductive if people want to lose weight or engage in more health-promoting behaviors, said first study author Dr. Larissa McGarrity, clinical psychologist in physical medicine and rehabilitation at University of Utah Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000e3b6mj7j9u0rj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Weight stigma centers around a pervasive public misconception: that what a person weighs is entirely within a person’s control.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000f3b6m2jjgzvpu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “As a result of that, people should just be able to eat healthy on their own, to lose weight on their own, to be physically active –– that’s their personal responsibility to do that,” said Pearl, who was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000g3b6mlov3ghqy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When a person doesn’t lose weight or comes up against barriers to that thin body ideal –– such as lack of access to nutritious and affordable foods, no place for physical activity, or their genetics –– the misconception says their body shape is a sign of a moral failing, said Dr. Alexis Conason, a psychologist and certified eating disorder specialist in New York City who also did not participate in the new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000h3b6mol10sf9i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Messages saying that a person has a responsibility to lose weight and is a worse person if they do not can come from images or storylines in television and social media, direct comments from people you know, and bullying or discrimination, Pearl said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000i3b6mt7ov13x0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It gets worse when a person absorbs those derogatory remarks from others about their body weight and applies it to themselves.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000j3b6m9f5i5py7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Experiencing stigma from other people is harmful,” Pearl said. “But for the individuals who really internalize that, that seems to be a really strong predictor of these negative eating and physical activity outcomes, but also kind of broader mental and physical health outcomes.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000k3b6m38po2862@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Physical activity is so important to many aspects of health, including &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/17/health/strength-training-live-longer-wellness"&gt;healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/10/health/exercise-depression-wellness"&gt;management of depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/26/health/insomnia-exercise-wellness"&gt;better sleep&lt;/a&gt; and lower &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/28/health/one-minute-exercise-cancer-wellness"&gt;cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000l3b6moh96wsak@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People often have a hard time going to the gym or getting outside for exercise, because it can feel intimidating or overwhelming, said Dr. A. Janet Tomiyama, professor of psychology at the University of California Los Angeles who was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000m3b6m8mxermw8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It is particularly hard if you know you will get comments, judgment or even just extra attention because of your weight, Conason added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000n3b6mbbkf0fei@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352827321000306" target="_blank"&gt;Research has linked&lt;/a&gt; experiencing and internalizing weight stigma to less motivation and enjoyment of physical activity, less confidence about exercising, and less time spent exercising, Pearl said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000o3b6m4xcdd58m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A gym is a location where a lot of weight stigma and fat shaming can happen,” said Tomiyama. “If you’ve been stigmatized for the way you look, the last thing you want to do is put on some tight clothes and go to a gym.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000p3b6mxo58pel6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Being judged for your body can be distressing, which can impact food choices.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000q3b6m6gojggtx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When someone is teased or criticized, or even just feels like they’re getting negative looks from other people around them, that is stressful,” Pearl said. “We know that one of the very common ways that everybody copes with stress is by eating more and eating more unhealthy kinds of foods.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000r3b6mx7k0sptu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Stress eating isn’t a behavior we need to shake our finger and shame people out of either, Tomiyama said. It is in our own biology as well as that of other animals, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000s3b6myxjyva37@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Physical or psychological stress signals your body to release the hormone&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;cortisol, Tomiyama said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000t3b6md77pa1xz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One of the things that cortisol does, is it works on our brain to really activate reward processes that make high-sugar, high-salt, high-calorie&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;food taste really, really good,” she added. “And so, at a brain level, it’s making these potentially health harming foods way harder to resist.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000u3b6mmhwly9gr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cortisol also blocks the parts of your brain that help you make decisions that benefit you in the long term, Tomiyama said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000v3b6mknwpvdsq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195666316300332" target="_blank"&gt;Research has linked&lt;/a&gt; exposure to weight stigma and unhealthy, disordered eating behaviors such as binge eating, purging and unhealthy restriction –– all of which undermine health, Pearl said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000w3b6m4425ehgv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unfortunately, weight stigma is pervasive, and it isn’t something you can snap your fingers and rid yourself of, Conason said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000x3b6mgkot1tp4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One step the medical field can take is to de-emphasize body mass index, or BMI, as an important marker of health, especially because it often classifies healthy people as unhealthy and those with health issues as falling into a healthy weight class, Tomiyama said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000y3b6mxva1v89x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When working with clients,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Conason also focuses on creating resiliency, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000z3b6mbytuuhsf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We may not be able to change the entire culture, but we can try to understand that the problem is the culture, not our bodies,” Conason said. “That can provide resiliency around moving through the world and experiencing weight stigma and trying not to internalize the stigma.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif00103b6mqf5r9gqy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Conason does this by helping clients build greater self-compassion, educating them on the ways in which a culture of weight stigma has influenced them, and encouraging the practice of acceptance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif00113b6m2k7i74z5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you notice an internalized weight stigma is affecting your behavior, contacting a disordered eating mental health counselor&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;or a weight-inclusive dietitian may be a helpful first step.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA — The Georgia Department of Public Health on Friday confirmed a fifth measles case in the state this year. Health officials said the person is the family member of a person with an earlier confirmed case back in May.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original case occurred in an unvaccinated metro Atlanta resident who had acquired the illness outside the country, DPH said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department did not provide any identifying information about the person or their relation to the individual with the earlier case.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Individuals who may have been exposed to either of these persons have been given the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine or antibodies to help reduce the risk of developing measles and are being monitored for symptoms," DPH said in a release Friday. "Currently, no new cases of measles have been reported outside of this family."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to DPH, there were six cases of measles reported in Georgia in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Measles is very contagious and spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Measles virus can stay in the air or on surfaces for up to two hours after an infected person has left the room," the DPH said in the release. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said measles symptoms appear seven to 14 days after contact with the virus. Common symptoms include high fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes. Then, the DPH said a rash of tiny red spots breaks out, starts at the head, and spreads to the rest of the body. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the DPH, MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine can prevent measles and rubella. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends children receive their first dose of MMR vaccine between 12-15 months of age and a second dose between 4-6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DPH said people with symptoms of measles should call their healthcare provider immediately. Health officials advise first calling your doctor's office, hospital, or public health clinic to let them know of any symptoms. Healthcare providers who suspect a patient has measles should then notify the DPH. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

But if testing were adequately improved and scaled up to become more accessible and commonplace, that figure could balloon to 6.1 million.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and heart disease should be prioritized for blood work and other screening tests, which will need to skyrocket from about two million to 36 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Follow-up testing also needs to jump by nearly 1,300 percent to meet patient needs, and in more settings than liver clinics, such as family doctors' offices, and with diabetes and heart doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with diabetes are especially prone to liver damage leading to MASH. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 30 to 60 percent of diabetics also have MASH. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Obesity is another leading risk factor, with estimates suggesting that 75 percent of overweight people and 90 percent with obesity will develop the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with MASH also have a tripled risk of also developing heart disease, including coronary artery disease, stroke, and heart failure, compared to people without the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MASH diagnosis is poised for a major shift, mirroring past breakthroughs in chronic disease management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While about four percent of adults in the US, UK, Germany and France have MASH, fewer than 18 percent are diagnosed. This leaves 16.7 million undiagnosed cases among up to 20 million affected&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With new treatments approved and others on the horizon, the focus now turns to fixing systemic roadblocks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently, limited access to non-invasive tests and reliance on specialists leave most cases undetected until late stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MASH arises from a cascade of liver damage typically linked to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-10720207/One-four-American-adults-living-potentially-LIFE-THREATENING-liver-disorder.html"&gt;a buildup of fat&lt;/a&gt; in the liver, which triggers inflammation that damages liver cells and activates scar-forming cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What was once healthy liver tissue becomes stiff, progressively crippling the liver's ability to detoxify blood. Though this is often painless until the damage becomes too severe to be reversed.  &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If caught early, people can live normal lifespans with MASH. Lifestyle changes - eating a healthier diet, exercising regularly, and losing between five and 10 percent of one's body weight - can slow down the progression of MASH and repair some of the damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors may prescribe resmetirom, the first FDA-approved medication for MASH, to work hand-in-hand with those lifestyle changes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But severe damage can cause deadly conditions that cut a person's life drastically short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Each late-stage MASH diagnosis represents a missed opportunity for earlier intervention to prevent disease progression, threatening worse [liver] and [non-liver] outcomes for people living with the condition and greater costs for individuals, health systems, and societies,' researchers told a Barcelona medical conference this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;If caught early, patients can slow the progression of MASH and even reserve some of the damage by making lifestyle changes and losing weight. Doctors may also prescribe a medication for the condition that works alongside weight loss to reduce severe health issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The solution requires concrete changes from moving diagnostics to implementing automated tools in electronic records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said that success in improving diagnostics goes beyond devising better tests. A fundamental reworking of methods of care is needed that catches at-risk patients before irreversible damage occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Paradigm shifts do not occur in a vacuum, but arise when leaps in science, technology, and innovation are coupled with changes in perception and understanding within a community,' they said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A confluence of factors in 2024 and expected drug approvals in many European countries in 2025 point to a near term tipping point for MASH diagnoses; nonetheless, focused and sustained efforts are needed to turn such opportunities into reality.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 16:00:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxOZ2prZHd0dXFCb1l4LU5LazBWUE56RGhEWldWbjgyMnB4R0NPLVpaRGNsSEljN1VPeUttVXUyb1J3NGJDZnAzdUxfR0tmdGd4NEZZSTQ5dVE5WkZoQU50azU2MnRadnVZN1I4M0FrdG5JcDk1dVlubGNFSk54cGFIRGh6dzF5QVFiUWNkd3ozWkRia0tlLVFsM29NRk5PSGQ1Z1hQSlBHZ0h2T2U1TDhRdVZkMHo5NXpjNUJraTlVOHfSAcYBQVVfeXFMT1d5OXNhb2xfY3hXV2twS0x4eFpZNWc2M3ozclN1TFo0Y1EwOGRtQVhsUFZnZV9KVlZsM3RDVmJwZTNLT2c5M1Z5Y3J1TkhoWXBETDZXVEJLNkFfaDZ3R1VYT0R0amRpRGZDWGxhZnVvazJyLVQ3dW5TMm5GRXA2RlNyODVUS0tCUWVXRUVhYk1KcjhpNEktaDJCQ3h3dzExdEtOZEtIZi1tX3JPWXk2el96aUNlWG93Ym1DdDV3NFYwalBCM1VB</guid></item><item><title>在安大略省，未接种疫苗的母亲感染麻疹后，新生儿早产儿死亡- Gizmodo | Premature Newborn Dies in Ontario After Catching Measles From Unvaccinated Mother - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxNd3d6dkxyZ0dKV0RIbjJrRXc3UnplUTh6VGJISHFJRXZiS2lCb2trdTRYaUVUcUJxVlNXajB6dHI0bERPN1kyemxsVF9hUlh3YVlVWEZjTmx3MXBpZmNqWTg3TzZyM25VYkx6Qm1Ja29xdEFnSXF3a0dpMnI5N0prTGlPUFhKbm1BRDlqRXpISGw1eG5hQzBjMTlsZFdQcTJRX0lxTGlrQUl4bEVlZlRTdlFR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;A premature newborn in Ontario, Canada, has died after contracting measles—the first death this year linked to an ongoing outbreak of the vaccine-preventable disease in the country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ontario health officials &lt;a href="https://news.ontario.ca/en/statement/1006004/statement-from-the-chief-medical-officer-of-health"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; the death Thursday. The child caught the viral infection from their mother, who was not vaccinated from measles. Canada, the U.S., and Mexico have all faced surging outbreaks of measles in 2025, fueled by low vaccination rates in certain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It is with deep sadness that I confirm that an infant, born prematurely and infected with measles, has tragically passed away in southwestern Ontario,” said Kieran Moore, the chief medical officer of health in Ontario, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ongoing measles outbreaks in North America are believed to have first started in Ontario last fall. By January 2025, measles began to hit parts of Texas, with cases eventually spreading to nearby states and Northern Mexico. The outbreaks have largely occurred in rural Mennonite communities where people often forego routine vaccinations and other healthcare services provided by outside doctors. The U.S. and Mexico have each reported around 1,000 cases of measles this year, while over 2,700 cases have been reported in Canada, mostly in Ontario. But these numbers are almost certainly an underestimate of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Moore, the child contracted measles while in the womb, which may have contributed to their premature birth. The child did have other medical complications unrelated to the virus, however, so it’s possible that the infection may not have been the primary or sole factor behind their death. Measles in general has a very low fatality rate, but it’s highly contagious among unvaccinated people and is known to be more dangerous to developing fetuses and very young children. Over 100,000 people &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles"&gt;died&lt;/a&gt; from measles globally in 2023, according to the World Health Organization, most of whom were children under the age of five.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though this is Canada’s first death linked to measles this year, it’s not the first in North America. There have been three confirmed measles deaths in the U.S. so far, while more than 100 people (mostly children) have been hospitalized. Unlike the latest death, two of these U.S. deaths &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/31898/712-cases-of-measles-reach-nearly-half-of-U-S?autologincheck=redirected#:~:text=Two%20of%20the%20deaths%20were%20unvaccinated%20school%2Dage%20children%20in%20Texas%20who%20had%20no%20underlying%20conditions."&gt;occurred&lt;/a&gt; in children with no pre-existing health issues.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles has been resurgent in much of the world as of late, aided by declining vaccination rates. But while this problem has been building up over time, the situation in the U.S. is only &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/millions-of-measles-cases-could-hit-u-s-over-next-25-years-if-vaccination-rates-drop-2000593944"&gt;expected to worsen&lt;/a&gt; under the current presidential administration. Many of President Donald Trump’s appointees—in particular Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—have regularly spread misinformation about the safety of vaccines, including the combination measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. Kennedy has both downplayed the ongoing outbreaks and supported dubious measles treatments with little to no evidence behind them, such as cod liver oil supplements. Many Americans today remain &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-shocking-number-of-americans-are-still-clueless-about-measles-polling-suggests-2000593282"&gt;woefully in the dark&lt;/a&gt; about the severity of these outbreaks and the importance of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Anyone who is unvaccinated is at risk and I urge everyone, but especially those who may become pregnant, to ensure they have received two doses of the MMR vaccine, which will protect both a parent and baby. This vaccine has been safely used for over 50 years and is highly effective,” Moore noted in his announcement of the child’s death.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A fitness trend known as Japanese walking is &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJfx77GPJbM/?hl=en"&gt;capturing attention online&lt;/a&gt;, promising major health benefits with minimal equipment and time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on interval-style bursts of fast and slow walking, Japanese walking was &lt;a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/walk-hard-walk-easy-repeat/?_r=0"&gt;developed&lt;/a&gt; by Professor Hiroshi Nose and Associate Professor Shizue Masuki at Shinshu University in Matsumoto, Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It involves alternating between three minutes of walking at a higher intensity and three minutes at a lower intensity, repeated for at least 30 minutes, four times per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The higher-intensity walking should be done at a level that is "somewhat hard". At this level, it is still possible to talk, but holding a full conversation would be more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161443" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161443" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2.jpg" alt="Older women walking together outdoors." class="wp-image-161443 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2.jpg 2121w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2121px) 100vw, 2121px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161443" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;You might need to stop chatting and pick up the pace. (Ariel Skelley/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lower-intensity walking should be done at a level that is "light". At this level, talking should be comfortable, though a little more laboured than an effortless conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese walking has been likened to high-intensity interval training or Hiit, and has been referred to as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0025619611613037"&gt;"high-intensity walking"&lt;/a&gt;, although it is less taxing than true Hiit and is performed at lower intensities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also easy to perform and requires only a stopwatch and space for walking. It requires little planning and is less time-consuming than other walking targets, such as achieving 10,000 steps a day. This makes it suitable for most people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the evidence show?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese walking offers significant health benefits. A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4065/82.7.803"&gt;2007 study&lt;/a&gt; from Japan compared this method to lower-intensity continuous walking, with a goal of achieving 8,000 steps per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who followed the Japanese walking approach experienced notable reductions in body weight. Blood pressure also dropped – more so than in those following the lower-intensity continuous walking routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leg strength and physical fitness were also measured in this study. Both improved to a greater extent in those following the Japanese walking programme, compared to those completing moderate-intensity continuous walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A longer-term &lt;a href="https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2018.32.1_supplement.588.9"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; also found that Japanese walking protects against the reductions in strength and fitness that happen with ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These improvements in health would also suggest that Japanese walking can help people live longer, though this has not yet been directly studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few things to consider with this new walking trend. In the 2007 study, around 22% of people did not complete the Japanese walking programme. For the lower intensity programme, with a target of 8,000 steps per day, around 17% did not complete it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that Japanese walking may not be suitable for everyone, and it might not be any easier or more attractive than simple step-based targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Achieving a certain number of &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00302-9/fulltext"&gt;steps per day&lt;/a&gt; has also been shown to help people live longer. For those aged 60 and older, the target should be around 6,000 to 8,000 steps a day and 8,000 to 10,000 for those aged under 60. Similar evidence does not appear to exist for Japanese walking… yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So is this walking trend really the be-all and end-all? Or does it matter less about what exercise you do and more about how often and how hard you do it? The answer is likely to be the latter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003757"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; tells us that people who regularly perform more bouts of moderate to vigorous physical activity live longer, regardless of how long each bout is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that we should focus on ensuring we perform regular moderate to vigorous physical activity and make it habitual. If that activity happens to be Japanese walking, then it's a worthwhile choice.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/257302/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Now, research points to a simple but powerful strategy that involves meeting a certain quota of weekly activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After combing through extensive data, epidemiologist &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo&lt;/a&gt; from the University of California, San Francisco (&lt;a href="https://medicine.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCSF&lt;/a&gt;) and her colleagues noticed that many individuals start off active but lose momentum by middle age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This decline appears to drive up the risk of developing hypertension, a medical condition marked by above-normal blood pressure levels that can result in heart disease and other complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-blood-pressure"&gt;Understanding blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hypertension" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hypertension&lt;/a&gt; affects billions worldwide, placing a significant burden on public health. It develops when the force of blood against the arterial walls remains too high, which can hurt critical organs over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of people live with hypertension without even realizing it, a reason it is often described as a silent condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once discovered, however, moderate to vigorous exercise has proven to be an effective way to reduce those numbers on the blood pressure gauge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inside-the-study"&gt;Inside the study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 5,100 adults from four US cities contributed to this one particular study on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/morning-coffee-drinkers-have-a-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers took regular physical measurements and tracked each person’s exercise routines over three decades to see how consistent physical activity influenced blood pressure later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At each stage, participants who logged more hours of physical effort ended up with better circulatory readings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who managed five hours of moderate exercise per week saw a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-foods-might-work-like-medicines-to-lower-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;meaningful reduction&lt;/a&gt; in their chances of having high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-activity-targets-that-matter"&gt;Activity targets that matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Achieving at least twice the current minimum adult guidelines may be more beneficial for the prevention of hypertension than simply meeting the minimum guidelines,” said &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/jason.nagata" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jason Nagata&lt;/a&gt;, a UCSF expert in young adult medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This perspective supports the evidence that any type of exercise can help manage blood pressure for people without advanced cardiovascular conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderate exercise helps the body regulate blood vessels and hormones linked to stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that staying active consistently, rather than pushing hard for a short spurt, can keep the cardiovascular system on a stable path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exercise-helps-blood-pressure"&gt;Exercise helps blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five-hour weekly target mentioned in the study isn’t just a random number. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It lines up with results from other &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;large-scale reviews&lt;/a&gt; showing that greater amounts of moderate aerobic activity (like brisk walking or biking) can lead to even bigger drops in systolic blood pressure, especially in people at risk but not yet diagnosed with cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review by the researchers confirmed this trend across 435 clinical trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings showed that regular exercise lowered &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;systolic blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; by an average of 3.5 mmHg in healthy adults and by 5.5 mmHg in those with lifestyle-related diseases, including hypertension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These numbers matter because even small reductions can significantly lower the risk of stroke and heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-social-and-racial-differences"&gt;Social and racial differences&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed that race and social backgrounds heavily influence a person’s ability to stay &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fitness-focused-medicine-physical-activity-reduces-chronic-disease-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;physically active&lt;/a&gt;. At 40 years old, physical activity dipped among White men and women, yet Black men and women saw a continued decline rather than a plateau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By age 45, Black women in the study surpassed White men in the number of hypertension cases. At 60, upwards of 80 to 90 percent of Black participants were living with high blood pressure, compared to around 70 percent of White men and about half of White women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people face hidden obstacles that make it difficult to stay active over the years. Work shifts, unsafe neighborhoods, lack of access to parks, and limited time all contribute to the decline in physical &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/caffeine-at-night-disrupts-sleep-and-brain-activity-especially-in-young-adults/"&gt;activity&lt;/a&gt;, especially in underserved communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although Black male youth may have high engagement in sports, socioeconomic factors, neighborhood environments, and work or family responsibilities may prevent continued engagement in physical activity through adulthood,” said Nagata. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers noted that socioeconomic factors and environment weren’t directly measured in this study, but they likely played a major role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-consistent-fitness-habits"&gt;Consistent fitness habits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Teenagers and those in their early 20s may be physically active but these patterns change with age,” explained Bibbins-Domingo. In earlier years, many teenagers and people in their early 20s get daily movement through sports and outdoor activities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This might be especially the case after high school when opportunities for physical &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fitness-focused-medicine-physical-activity-reduces-chronic-disease-risk/"&gt;activity&lt;/a&gt; diminish,” said Nagata. At some point, life’s responsibilities can interfere with exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health advocates often focus on educating children and adolescents about adopting active lifestyles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in this study highlight how those messages remain vital for maintaining heart health as people transition to jobs, parenthood, and hectic schedules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-pressure-exercise-and-heart-health"&gt;Blood pressure, exercise, and heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health guidelines recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week for adults, though this research suggests going beyond that threshold offers clear advantages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding structured workouts or simple movement like brisk walks can be powerful steps in lowering long-term risk of high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a committed exercise routine takes extra planning as the years go by. However, the rewards include protecting the heart, keeping &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-from-plastic-bottles-linked-to-high-blood-pressure-and-heart-problems/"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; vessels flexible, and minimizing the negative effects of chronic stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying consistent with physical activity offers a chance to lower the probability of hypertension before serious complications set in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41440-024-01974-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Journal of Preventive Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 14:41:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxOVlR4OXpBeC1TZ0lpNHRubGMtZ1BhSFNPTkIyZ2VQSnJCS29wNDNkaGhRTG1BcWs0b2xkVXRNV2NnUjdxLXFoM3JvZzNrNHh5MzN0aWt2TmpOVjY0dVpZXzMzMnBjZmRsUGYxX3lRNTJBbWJ1NGd3VGEzTnFoTGZrZ05mR0ZRM1djZHFwTDZHVGFFclJkZTVkZjV0d1VpYkZqeEY3bzhaaTIxTF9EOVJ4dmhMZ0d4YUtMc1puVDhB</guid></item><item><title>餐厅受到Hickman Farms禽流感疫情的打击- ABC15亚利桑那州 | Restaurants take hit with Hickman Farms bird flu outbreak - ABC15 Arizona</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPMGJaVmFub3pKNUxnT3VCekVMajZQQmFUbllsSVZXcmV5cWlYWm1WcTNTSDFIamVyaFU4b09xWDlRalduOXVIWUlWZFJGLXZaSXM4TUhIc2pkNkI2YmRCLUp1NnUwS1FXbS1VZFJiZHAtNnRHSW9zQjNfbWFEaUlSdWxCeUVvbk5qUkVtTnNmZENGejlWZmxqMlJCWUZEVEk3RXlB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextArticleBody-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHOENIX — Even as &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.abc15.com/news/local-news/rising-egg-prices-taking-a-toll-on-valley-restaurants"&gt;sky-high egg prices&lt;/a&gt; have eased, a new problem is emerging for local restaurants and food vendors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.abc15.com/news/state/third-case-of-bird-flu-detected-at-commercial-farm-in-maricopa-county"&gt;bird flu at Hickman’s Farms&lt;/a&gt; created another hurdle for the local food industry, as the farm is one of the largest egg suppliers in the southwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carolina's Mexican Food uses Hickman’s Farms eggs for their breakfast burritos, and one of their suppliers, Merit Foods, told ABC15 the West Valley farm was their only supplier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;We follow up with their owner and others as they look to navigate another hurdle with the egg industry in the video player above.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They warned that the U.S. could be at the mercy of other countries in the next pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The administration's actions are gutting our deterrence from biological threats," said Beth Cameron, a senior adviser to the Brown University Pandemic Center and a former director at the White House National Security Council. "Canceling this investment is a signal that we are changing our posture on pandemic preparedness," she added, "and that is not good for the American people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Flu pandemics killed up to &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://news.emory.edu/features/2018/10/flu-pandemic/index.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;103 million people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide last century, researchers estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In anticipation of the next big one, the U.S. government began bolstering the nation's pandemic flu defenses during the George W. Bush administration. These strategies were designed by the security council and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority at the Department of Health and Human Services, among other agencies. The plans rely on rolling out vaccines rapidly in a pandemic. Moving fast hinges on producing vaccines domestically, ensuring their safety and getting them into arms across the nation through the public health system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The Trump administration is undermining each of these steps as it guts health agencies, cuts research and health budgets and issues perplexing policy changes, health security experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Since President Donald Trump took office, at least half of the security council's staff have been laid off or left, and the future of BARDA is murky.

"When the need hits and we aren't ready, no other country will come to our rescue and we will suffer greatly," said Rick Bright, an immunologist and a former BARDA director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Countries that produced their own vaccines in the COVID-19 pandemic had &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02383-z" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;first dibs&lt;/a&gt; on the shots. While the United States, home to Moderna and Pfizer, rolled out second doses of mRNA vaccines in 2021, hundreds of thousands of people in countries that didn't manufacture vaccines died waiting for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The most pertinent pandemic threat today is the bird flu virus H5N1. Researchers around the world &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/bird-flu-ground-zero-texas-dairy-farms-whodunit-h5n1/" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;were alarmed&lt;/a&gt; when it began spreading among cattle in the U.S. last year. Cows are closer to humans biologically than birds, indicating that the virus had evolved to thrive in cells like our own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As hundreds of herds and dozens of people were infected in the U.S., the Biden administration funded Moderna to develop bird flu vaccines using mRNA technology. As part of the agreement, the U.S. government stipulated it could purchase doses in advance of a pandemic. That no longer stands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Researchers can make bird flu vaccines in other ways, but mRNA vaccines are developed much more quickly because they don't rely on finicky biological processes, such as growing elements of vaccines in chicken eggs or cells kept alive in laboratory tanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Time matters because flu viruses mutate constantly, and vaccines work better when they match whatever variant is circulating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Developing vaccines within eggs or cells can take 10 months after the genetic sequence of a variant is known, Bright said. And relying on eggs presents an additional risk when it comes to bird flu because a pandemic could wipe out billions of chickens, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/bird-flu-potential-pandemic-vaccine-chicken-egg-quandary/" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;crashing egg supplies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Decades-old methods that rely on inactivated flu viruses are riskier for researchers and time-consuming. Still the Trump administration &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/trump-hhs-rfk-flu-vaccine-nih-grant-taubenberger/" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;invested $500 million&lt;/a&gt; into this approach, which was largely abandoned by the 1980s after it caused seizures in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"This politicized regression is baffling," Bright said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;A bird flu pandemic may begin quietly in the U.S. if the virus evolves to spread between people but &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/bird-flu-trump-immigration-raids-farmworkers-threats-california-michigan/" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;no one is tested&lt;/a&gt; at first. Indeed, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's dashboard suggests that only 10 farmworkers have been tested for the bird flu since March.

If the Senate approves Trump's proposed budget, the agency faces about $32 billion in cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Further, the Trump administration's cuts to biomedical research and its push to slash grant money for overhead costs could undermine academic hospitals, rendering them unable to conduct large clinical trials.

"The longer it takes to respond, the more people die."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Researchers suggest other countries would produce bird flu vaccines first. "The U.S. may be on the receiving end like India was, where everyone -- rich people, too -- got vaccines late," said Achal Prabhala, a public health researcher in India at medicines access group AccessIBSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He sits on the board of a &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://medicinespatentpool.org/what-we-do/mrna-technology-transfer-programme" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;World Health Organization initiative&lt;/a&gt; to improve access to mRNA vaccines in the next pandemic. A member of the initiative, the company Sinergium Biotech in Argentina, is testing an mRNA vaccine against the bird flu. If it works, Sinergium will share the intellectual property behind the vaccine with about a dozen other groups in the program from middle-income countries so they can produce it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, an international partnership headquartered in Norway, is providing funds to research groups developing rapid-response vaccine technology, including mRNA, in South Korea, Singapore and France. And CEPI committed up to $20 million to efforts to prepare for a bird flu pandemic. This year, the Indian government issued a call for grant applications to develop mRNA vaccines for the bird flu, warning it "poses a grave public health risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Pharmaceutical companies are investing in mRNA vaccines for the bird flu as well. However, Prabhala says private capital isn't sufficient to bring early-stage vaccines through clinical trials and large-scale manufacturing. That's because there's no market for bird flu vaccines until a pandemic hits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Limited supplies means the United States would have to wait in line for mRNA vaccines made abroad. States and cities may compete against one another for deals with outside governments and companies, like they did for medical equipment at the peak of the covid pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I fear we will once again see the kind of hunger games we saw in 2020," Cameron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In an email response to queries, HHS communications director Andrew Nixon said, "We concluded that continued investment in Moderna's H5N1 mRNA vaccine was not scientifically or ethically justifiable."

By comparing identical twins where only one has MS, researchers reduced confounding genetic and environmental factors and pinpointed 51 bacterial taxa with different abundances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a mouse model, they found that gut bacteria from MS-affected twins could trigger MS-like symptoms, implicating Lachnoclostridium sp. and Eisenbergiella tayi as potential disease-causing microbes. These findings open a path to targeted gut-based therapies and emphasize the role of microbiome and lifestyle in MS development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MS-Discordant Twins Used:&lt;/strong&gt; Identical twins helped isolate microbial factors by minimizing genetic and lifestyle variation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functional Evidence in Mice:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice colonized with gut bacteria from MS patients developed MS-like symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two Microbes Implicated:&lt;/strong&gt; Lachnoclostridium sp. and Eisenbergiella tayi emerged as potential MS triggers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Max Planck Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than 280,000 people in Germany have multiple sclerosis (MS) and approximately 15,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes MS the most common inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. In MS, the body’s own immune cells attack the insulating layer surrounding nerve fibers, damaging their function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on where attacks occur, a wide variety of symptoms can arise, which is why MS is also known as the disease of a thousand faces. Impaired vision, other sensory disturbances, and paralysis are just some of the symptoms that people living with MS must contend with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly how MS causes immune cells to become dysfunctional is still largely unclear. MS is a multifactorial disease—there is no single trigger, but rather several factors must come together for the disease to develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to genetic components, various environmental factors such as smoking, vitamin D deficiency, certain infectious diseases, and especially microorganisms in the gut have all been linked to the development of MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have identified numerous bacterial strains that distinguish the intestinal flora of MS patients from that of healthy individuals. However, the significance of these differences for the course of the disease remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, it was often difficult to interpret the results, as genetic differences or differing eating habits among the test subjects can have a major influence on the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Twin study reduces confounding factors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To minimize these confounding factors, a team from several research institutions launched a major collaborative project—with the help of twins. Although identical twins share nearly the same genetic makeup, in some MS cases one twin may develop the disease while the other remains symptom-free—known as an MS-discordant pair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 100 such twin pairs are currently taking part in the MS TWIN STUDY at the Institute of Clinical Neuroimmunology at the University Hospital of the LMU Munich, enabling the disease to be studied under more comparable conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to their minimal genetic differences, the twins lived together until early adulthood, meaning they were exposed to many of the same environmental factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Comparing the gut flora&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined stool samples from 81 pairs of twins enrolled in the MS TWIN STUDY, and compared their composition between siblings. They identified 51 taxa—groups of microorganisms—that differed in abundance between twins with and without MS symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the researchers went one step further in this study: Four of the twin pairs also agreed to have samples taken from their small intestines using enteroscopy. The disease-causing interactions between microorganisms and the body’s own immune cells are believed to occur there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, most previous studies have relied exclusively on stool samples, which provide only limited information about the microorganisms in the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test whether the samples from the small intestine contain disease-causing organisms, the researchers used special transgenic mice. These live a healthy life under germ-free conditions, however after colonization with gut bacteria, they can develop a MS-like disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the study, the mice were given samples from a twin with or without MS in parallel. Symptoms were mainly observed in mice that had been colonized with MS samples, indicating the presence of disease-causing microorganisms in the small intestines of people with MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then examined the feces of the diseased mice and identified two members of the family of Lachnospiraceae (&lt;em&gt;Lachnoclostridium sp&lt;/em&gt;. and &lt;em&gt;Eisenbergiella tayi&lt;/em&gt;) as potential disease-causing factors. Due to their low abundance in the intestine, these bacteria had previously only been associated with MS in large and well-controlled studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, with their innovative experimental strategy, the researchers were able for the first time to functionally characterize these bacteria and provide evidence for their pathogenicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists emphasize that there may be other microorganisms with the potential to trigger MS. Further studies are needed to obtain a more comprehensive picture and to examine the pathogenicity of the two candidates identified so far in detail—initially in a mouse model of the disease and later also regarding the transferability of the results to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if it turns out that only a small number of microorganisms trigger the disease, this could open up new therapeutic options. Strikingly, the study demonstrates the role that lifestyle habits play in the development of MS and provides new experimental strategies to further investigate their effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this multiple sclerosis research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a9cac1dbc0daddc0c7c887cbc0ccc5c4ccc0ccdbe9cbc087c4d9ce87cdcc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Christine Bielmeier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mpg.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Max Planck Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Christine Bielmeier – Max Planck Institute&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2419689122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Multiple sclerosis and gut microbiota: Lachnospiraceae from the ileum of MS twins trigger MS-like disease in germfree transgenic mice—An unbiased functional study&lt;/a&gt;” by Hartmut Wekerle et al. &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple sclerosis and gut microbiota: Lachnospiraceae from the ileum of MS twins trigger MS-like disease in germfree transgenic mice—An unbiased functional study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We developed a two-tiered strategy aiming to identify gut bacteria functionally linked to the development of multiple sclerosis (MS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we compared gut microbial profiles in a cohort of 81 monozygotic twins discordant for MS.

In an exploratory approach, we enteroscopically sampled microbiota from different gut segments of selected twin pairs and compared their compositional profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess their functional potential, samples were orally transferred into germfree transgenic mice prone to develop spontaneous MS-like experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) upon bacterial colonization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that MS-derived ileal microbiota induced EAE at substantially higher rates than analogous material from healthy twin donors. Furthermore, female mice were more susceptible to disease development than males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The likely active organisms were identified as &lt;em&gt;Eisenbergiella tayi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lachnoclostridium,&lt;/em&gt; members of the Lachnospiraceae family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results identify potentially disease-facilitating bacteria sampled from the ileum of MS affected twins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experimental strategy may pave the way to functionally understand the role of gut microbiota in initiation of MS.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 13:35:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiYEFVX3lxTE02Nl93SVpuVV9qdUpRYXV5OFVpeE16TnhNMkZfXzgtTVVUMno0NHZIcUk1N1F2Yk93ZG1PV0xJeUtVUWNydTkyYUdiVVNtd2NSaFhvZXJHYV9nRmxjQnZyUQ</guid></item><item><title>怀孕期间未摄入足够的某些食物可能会增加婴儿成为双性人的机会-每日邮报 | Not eating enough of certain food during pregnancy may raise chance of baby being intersex - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPWWctbWFpeTBEVG4wYkFFNnFjek1qSGZkelRHNTRsSnl4OGRrZGdxZFJBMkRHNW9kTGlHX1JtaWg3dTFtbUJOM0NYbUt5YmtITGxocFR3SHo1bFZxYXNlc3hrYkpFZWZPY01wT3hUN2FYa3hhS0pWUE1GS05VVUpjM2JzUVFpYmVaNXpDbXNzWjJfdWZmNTQ1Mm5UNmN2V0lBYWVKMzVuYUQ2d9IBrwFBVV95cUxPRzZfVFR6V2pabDZHQXVhTnpLalVhR01RTVpDMFNhV3hvb3NXbWQtVVdVOUZfUlREcDNoNHlydDBMT2RLdDJKeG5OZXV2bWtvRkJMdEl6WDcyNWd6Z29uUGJrRzlFNWExTk15WXBYamdLYlRDM1Q4Q1BpdUJYY2dsdlNaMDdLRUIweGZJVzVBNU1pRzR5RndTeVNWdUt2SWNBekVLakdfTDBiTWR3aDVZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not getting enough iron during pregnancy could raise the risk of babies being born intersex, a study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have found for the first time that pregnant mice deficient in the mineral are more likely to give birth to males who have female genitalia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14779805/pregnancy-woman-drinking-alcohol.html"&gt;This deficiency during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; is most often caused by a&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14715491/Tired-time-nutritional-deficiency-warn-experts.html"&gt; lack of iron in the diet&lt;/a&gt;, which can naturally come from eating iron-rich foods like red meat, red kidney beans, edamame beans, chickpeas, nuts and leafy green vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A simple blood test can determine a woman's iron levels and if she is deficient, a supplement can be prescribed. Sometimes, it is recommended to also take vitamin C, which can help the body absorb iron more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is already known that iron plays a role in organ development, and another recent study showed babies born to mothers with low iron levels were more likely to suffer heart defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the new evidence suggests the mineral could also influence the development of sex organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The recent study is the first time a dietary mineral has been found to trigger intersex, which occurs in one to two percent of the population, and while the team said there hasn't been any research to make this link in humans, they believe it could play a role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead researcher Vincent Harley, a molecular geneticist at the Hudson Institute of Medical Research in Australia, said this 'presents an exciting new area of study.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Not getting enough iron during pregnancy could raise the risk of babies being born intersex, a study suggests &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Intersex is a condition in which individuals have genitals or reproductive organs that do not fit the typical binary definitions of male or female. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who are intersex may also have chromosomes that differ from the typical male and female binary. Their genitals may not match their reproductive organs or they may have traits of both. This can include variations in e&lt;span&gt;xternal or internal reproductive organs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In mammals, biological sex is determined by the presence or absence of a Y chromosome — females typically have XX chromosomes whereas males typically have XY ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, a primary gene is responsible for formation of the corresponding sexual organs, such as testicles and penis or ovaries and vagina. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mice, for instance, with XY chromosomes usually develop testes if a gene called 'Sry' (Sex-determining Region Y gene) is activated and ovaries if it is not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers behind this latest study had previously shown that Sry is activated by an enzyme called 'histone demethylase,' which needs iron to function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In their new lab tests, they looked at how iron levels would therefore impact the development of sexual&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14732945/fertility-female-experts-improve-birth-rate-decline.html"&gt; organs in unborn babies. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one of their trials, the researchers gave mice with low levels of histone demethylase an iron-deficient diet for a month before pregnancy and for two weeks during pregnancy, and compared them with mice that were fed a control diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The levels of hemoglobin and red blood cells were lower among iron-deficient mice than in the control-diet mice, as expected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But two of the 43 male babies carried by iron-deficient mothers also developed female-typical sex organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All the control mice grew sex organs typical of their chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other tests, which dug into the impact of iron further, revealed similar results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Iron deficiency during pregnancy is most often caused by a lack of iron in the diet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one study, four mice with XY (typical male) chromosomes were born with two ovaries and one with one ovary and one testis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It could be posited that when iron levels are low, the enzyme 'histone demethylase' may not activate the Sry gene, which is responsible for the development of male sex organs and reproductive organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because of this, mice with XY chromosomes may develop female - or both types of - organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Emerging evidence suggests maternal diet and exposure to environmental toxins can affect gene activity involved in the early development of testes and ovaries. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The latest findings could have implications for medical advice about iron intake during pregnancy, Harley adds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A separate study investigating the link between iron and organ development found b&lt;/span&gt;abies born to mothers with low iron levels are far more likely to suffer heart defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists now posit anemia - low levels of red blood cells due to low iron levels - in pregnant women may be to blame for about one in 20 congenital heart disease (CHD) cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The deadly condition is one of the most common types of birth defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, by the British Heart Foundation, analyzed the data of 16,500 mothers and found the chances of having a child with CHD was 47 percent greater in women with low iron levels in their first 100 days of pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts will now investigate whether taking iron supplements before and during pregnancy could help prevent heart defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;In recent years, an increasing number of scientific investigations have backed an alarming hypothesis:  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="164012" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease may not be merely a condition of an aging brain, &lt;a href="scientists-identify-a-virus-and-two-types-of-bacteria-that-could-be-linked-to-alzheimer-s"&gt;but the product of infection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the exact mechanisms of this infection are something researchers are &lt;a href="scientists-think-alzheimer-s-may-be-caused-by-our-brains-defence-system"&gt;still trying to isolate&lt;/a&gt;, numerous studies suggest the &lt;a href="alzheimers-disease-beta-amyloid-source-outside-brain"&gt;deadly spread&lt;/a&gt; of Alzheimer's &lt;a href="surgical-tools-could-spreading-alzheimers-proteins"&gt;goes way beyond&lt;/a&gt; what we used to think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such study, published in 2019, suggested what could be one of the most definitive leads yet for a bacterial culprit behind Alzheimer's, and it comes from a somewhat unexpected quarter: gum disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of their study:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a paper led by senior author Jan Potempa, a microbiologist from the University of Louisville, researchers reported the discovery of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyromonas_gingivalis"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Porphyromonas gingivalis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – the pathogen behind &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_periodontitis"&gt;chronic periodontitis&lt;/a&gt; (aka gum disease) – in the brains of deceased Alzheimer's patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't the first time the &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1532-5415.2010.02788.x"&gt;two factors have been linked&lt;/a&gt;, but the researchers went further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In separate experiments with mice, oral infection with the pathogen led to brain colonization by the bacteria, together with increased production of amyloid beta (Aβ), the sticky proteins commonly associated with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, coordinated by pharma startup Cortexyme, which was co-founded by first author Stephen Dominy, wasn't claiming to have discovered definitive evidence of Alzheimer's causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was clear they thought we had a strong line of investigation here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=" wf_caption"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="/images/2019-01/530-alzheimers-gum-disease-bacteria-1.jpg" alt="530 alzheimers gum disease bacteria 1" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis' gingipains&lt;/em&gt; (red) among neurons in the brain of a patient with Alzheimer's. (Cortexyme)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Infectious agents have been implicated in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease before, but the evidence of causation hasn't been convincing," &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324298"&gt;Dominy said at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now, for the first time, we have solid evidence connecting the intracellular, Gram-negative pathogen, &lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt;, and Alzheimer's pathogenesis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the team identified toxic enzymes called gingipains secreted by the bacteria in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, which correlated with two separate markers of the disease: the tau protein, and a protein tag called ubiquitin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even more compellingly, the team identified these toxic gingipains in the brains of deceased people who were never diagnosed with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's important, because while &lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; and the disease have been linked before, it's never been known – to put it simply – whether gum disease causes Alzheimers, or whether dementia leads to poor oral care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152675" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152675" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/dentist_gum_disease_642.jpg" alt="dentist checking x rays" class="wp-image-152675 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/dentist_gum_disease_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/dentist_gum_disease_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/dentist_gum_disease_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152675" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Does gum disease cause Alzheimer's, or could those with dementia be at greater risk of poor dental hygiene?

The implant, woven into a lattice of light-sensitive nanowires, converts both visible and near-infrared light into electrical signals for the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In blind mice, it restored visual reflexes and behavioral vision, while in macaques, it enhanced detection of wavelengths beyond natural sight. This breakthrough marks a major step toward restoring vision in the blind and augmenting human vision beyond current biological limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vision Restored in Mice:&lt;/strong&gt; The nanowire prosthesis restored pupil reflexes and visual cortex activity in blind mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrared Vision in Macaques:&lt;/strong&gt; Sighted primates with the implant gained sensitivity to near-infrared light.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safe and Biocompatible:&lt;/strong&gt; The implant showed no adverse effects in blind macaques, supporting long-term clinical promise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AAAS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new prosthesis for the retina weaved with nanowires partially restored vision in blind mice and allowed detection of near-infrared light in macaques, according to a new study. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new technology’s feasibility and strong safety profile marks a milestone in the development of artificial vision, which could prove invaluable to patients worldwide who are living with blindness or retinal disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are many approaches to restoring vision in the blind, but almost all of these treatments face obstacles such as electrical interference or a lack of long-term efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110713"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne.jpg" alt="This shows an eye." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Using imaging and electrophysiological recording, the team found that implanting the prosthesis into genetically blind mice restored reflexes in the pupil and evoked neuron firing in the visual cortex. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, researchers are also trying to augment the human eye’s capabilities to detect other wavelengths of light, including near-infrared. Such a technology could be a boon to vision restoration efforts, as detecting near-infrared light would provide better color contrast and could be helpful in dark conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To kill two birds with one stone, Shuiyuan Wang and colleagues designed a nanoprosthesis for the retina based on tellurium, a silver-white, light-sensitive element that’s used as a semiconductor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers constructed tellurium nanowires and interlaced them into a lattice network, creating an architecture that can easily be implanted and efficiently converts both visible and near-infrared light into electrical signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using imaging and electrophysiological recording, the team found that implanting the prosthesis into genetically blind mice restored reflexes in the pupil and evoked neuron firing in the visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blind mice with the implants also performed better on pattern recognition tests and could find LED lights during a behavioral test, and eventually almost matched the performance of normal mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nanoprosthesis was safe and biocompatible when implanted into a blind crab-eating macaque, and augmented the eye’s sensitivity to near-infrared light in a sighted macaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The long-term success of these technologies depends on developing cost-effective solutions and ensuring their availability to a broader range of patients,” cautions Eduardo Fernández in a related Perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurotech and visual neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#daa9b9b3aabbb19abbbbbba9f4b5a8bd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Science Press Package&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aaas.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AAAS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Science Press Package – AAAS&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adu2987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tellirium nanowire retinal nanoprosthesis improves vision in models of blindness&lt;/a&gt;” by Shuiyuan Wang et al. &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tellirium nanowire retinal nanoprosthesis improves vision in models of blindness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In nature, there are animals, such as snakes, that assess their environment more accurately by sensing both infrared radiation and the visible-light spectrum. The human eye lacks photoreceptors responsive to the infrared spectrum, and infrared light with a longer wavelength and lower energy cannot trigger visual signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In patients with severe eye diseases (e.g., macular degeneration), infrared vision could, in principle, aid vision in low light and darkness. Developing technologies that use a wider spectrum of light, including infrared, could provide notable benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;RATIONALE&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Present designs for broad-spectrum retinal protheses use nanoparticles or photodiodes to convert infrared into visible light or heat to stimulate retinal cells. Because they require injections or bulky auxiliary devices, there are safety and practicality issues for potential application to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creation of a safe, easy-to-implant retinal prosthesis that enables the processing of both visible and infrared light may restore vision loss and enhance natural vision. We designed a next-generation retinal nanoprosthesis based on tellurium nanowire networks that intrinsically converts broadband light—including visible to infrared light—with efficient photovoltaic conversion, yielding giant with photocurrents under zero-electric bias and without the need for extra auxiliary equipment. We then achieved safe and simple implantation in the subretinal space of mice and &lt;em&gt;Macaca fascicularis&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through theoretical calculations, we show spontaneous giant and wide-spectrum photocurrents of tellurium nanowire networks to be correlated with the asymmetry of nanowire lattice internal defects and external interfacial effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a combination of narrow bandgaps, strong absorption, and engineered asymmetries, tellurium optoelectronic nanodevices showed record-high photocurrents and the widest spectrum of responsive photosensitivity wavelengths compared with reported techniques for the restoration of photosensitivity in blindness, covering the visible to near-infrared–II range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preimplantation tests confirmed the stability of the nanoprosthesis’s optoelectronic properties and its precise response to light patterns. In blind mice, the implanted nanoprosthesis replaced damaged photoreceptors and triggered responses in both the optic nerve and visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implanted mice showed better light-induced pupil reactions and improvement in light-associated learning behaviors (such as water reward–based visual-cue associative learning and choice-box tasks) when compared with untreated mice and when using light intensities nearly 80 times weaker than the clinical safety threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biocompatibility and efficacy of the proposed nanoprosthesis was further demonstrated in nonhuman primates (&lt;em&gt;Macaca fascicularis&lt;/em&gt;), where the nanoprosthesis was tightly bound to the retina in the subretinal space and generated robust retina-derived responses to visible and infrared light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study provides biologically feasible parameters for a retinal prosthesis using designed tellurium nanowire networks. These nanowires naturally convert light into photocurrent signals with zero electrical bias and can cover the visible to infrared spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tested nanoprosthesis generates strong photocurrents to activate the remaining retinal circuitry in a dysfunctional eye, works through a simple subretinal implantation procedure, and avoids bulky intra- and extraocular components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In blind mice, this retinal nanoprosthesis restored the brain’s response to light and improved vision-based behaviors at clinically safe light levels. Nonhuman primates implanted with this nanoprosthesis gained infrared vision without impairment of normal vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This successful animal study paves the way for future human trials, showcasing the potential of this prosthesis to restore visible vision and expand augmented infrared perception for blind humans and offer a safer, more effective, and wider-spectrum solution than existing technologies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 12:55:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE1PVmJJZHdJZlhuWkZ1TXd6M0R3bVE5amxNWHhKemloNW5YaEpzLS1ZbzlhNlJCM0FyQ2kzVHdXUnEwcURvMmZEbURoY2w5REJlTkRPVnBFWG1FUzBaZWtIYThtakJsZW5BVTNF</guid></item><item><title>您的汗水可以揭示您的健康状况- CNN | What Your Sweat Could Reveal About Your Health - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxOUFBaaGhwbVlPempld1NaR0xpdEwyWUtwck1fVERub3ZBN3R4UXBPallkZEVVT0Y0R1hFQXc2WnJaV09Ramo3bnNRZ2F1TG5fNV92dTBWVGVEYzJ6d3I4TW5CRF9nUnRTM3RydnZWU1NQanF3X3pEUkM1Z0k4bG5Yc3V0UEdWdUpaX3pmdUhlU042Z0NPeUtVVw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="episode-transcript-container" id="transcript-container"&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Welcome to Chasing Life and welcome to Summertime. You know, it's that time of year. Barbecues, baseball games, the beach, lounging by the pool, maybe lounging by the lake like we do in my home state of Michigan. I love summertime. But you know, summertime also means heat and for our bodies, that means sweat. We all sweat every day. Some of us more than others, yes, but nothing to be ashamed of. You certainly know that sweat is our body's natural cooling system. There's been all this research recently telling us that sweat can do a lot more than just turn down our body's temperature. Each droplet of sweat could be full of signs and signals about what's going on deep inside our bodies. Sweat could be the key to understanding not only our hydration, but also our nutrient levels, our kidney health. Sweat is a lot fascinating than you probably ever realized. And today I'm sitting down one of the scientists who's leading that research. His name is Professor John Rogers, and he is director of Northwestern's Querry Simpson Institute for Bioelectronics. He is an expert on sweat, and he's gonna talk me through the basics of sweat, but also its potential, and help me understand how sweat could save a lot of lives and help us all perform at our very best. I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, and this is Chasing Life.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:01:37
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              First of all, just some terms. What is sweat?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So sweat is a fluid created by glands that exist about a millimeter below the surface of the skin. These glands connect to ducts that transport sweat generated by the glands to the surface of the skin. The density of sweat glands is highest on the fingertips about 400 glands per square centimeter.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:02:01
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              On your fingertips? I didn't realize that.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah, if you look at the sort of the magnified view of your fingertips, the sweat pores exist on the upper surfaces of the ridges of the texture of the skin of the fingertips. So quite a lot of sweat will come out of your finger tips. You get sweaty palms, you know, you feel nervous or something like that, you're exercising. But you have also sweat glands distributed across your entire body, obviously not just your fingertips. So there's pretty high density of sweat glands in your forehead. About a hundred and fifty sweat glands per square centimeter on your forearms uh... Maybe half of that on your back and your your abdomen that kind of thing so there are two classes of sweat glands one is called eccrine sweat glands uh... And those are the ones that i just referred to. There are other sweat glands that a little bit different and they involve a more complex chemistry associated with the sweat those are that apocrine glands they exist the armpits the genital regions and so on.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:02:59
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Most people hear sweat and they think... I get hot, I sweat. That helps my body cool down. Is that the primary reason we sweat?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Primarily, that is the reason for thermal regulation, so maintaining thermal homeostasis. So sweating is triggered when the core body temperature rises above a certain threshold, and then the rate of sweating is determined by the external temperature and humidity level and so on. But sweating can also be induced by nervousness. There are sort of emotional cues that will cause a sweating. You're really nervous in an interview, you will start to sweat.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:03:35
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Are you sweating now?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Not yet, yeah. We'll see how it goes. And there are different kinds of foods that you can eat, right, that will cause sweat.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:03:43
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So you mentioned three reasons that we sweat to cool the body when we may be nervous and maybe in response to certain foods. Is the sweat different depending on what the stimulus for the sweat?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              It's more or less the same, although the chemical composition of sweat can depend on sweat rate and the total volume of sweat that's been lost. So if you sweat very quickly, for example, at a high rate of sweating, the chloride concentration can be higher than its slow rates of sweating. So there are some dependencies there on the rate and the amount of sweat has been lost, but not so much on the mechanism by which the sweat is induced.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:04:25
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Is your sweat fundamentally going to be similar to my sweat? Is there variation from human to human?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So there's quite a large variation in the electrolyte level in sweat, and that's just genetically determined. It can be modulated by that, but there's sort of genetic baseline that determines your kind of average electrolyte levels. But it can be modulated by dietary habits, it can modulated be the amount of exercise you're doing, your fitness levels, that kind of thing. But for more basic biochemical species, let's say creatinine and urea, which we'll talk about in a little bit in the context of kidney health. That tends, what we're seeing in the data is that those two biochemicals species in sweat correlate very nicely with the same species in blood.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:05:15
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Now I do want to take a moment here and explain a couple things. First of all, the reason sweat carries the same biomarkers as blood is because they have something in common: interstitial fluid. Interstitial fluid comes from blood as it's traveling through small blood vessels or capillaries. It's found throughout the body and its main function is to transport oxygen and other nutrients to cells and also remove waste from cells. But here's the thing: When sweat glands are activated, they are pulling from that same interstitial fluid, which then diffuses across layers of skin to become sweat. The second thing you're gonna hear us talk a lot about the concept of correlation. Specifically, whether or not certain levels of biomarkers detected in sweat could have the same medical significance if found in blood. When I went to the doctor, I got my blood drawn and everything, they're measuring basic chemistries, my sodium, my potassium, chloride, things like that. They might also measure my cholesterol and lipids and things like that. What can sweat measure?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So for the things that we're looking at specifically, it's electrolyte level, electrolyte replenishment becomes very important for athletes, for workers in oil and gas manufacturing, construction, that kind of thing. Chloride for cystic fibrosis diagnostics, we published on that and we've done studies on large cohorts of infants. Kidney health is one that we think is really, really interesting. Looking at creatinine and urea concentrations in sweat, as I mentioned. We're also very interested in sweat, the nutritional biomarkers that are in sweat. So we have assays for vitamin D9, vitamin C, calcium, zinc, and iron. And we're in the process of establishing whether those species in sweat also correlate with species in blood. That's ongoing work. But I think that would be very powerful because you would be able to assess nutritional balance very quickly, right? And I think especially in lower and middle income countries. Nutritional deficiencies in pediatric patients can cause health challenges throughout an individual's life.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:07:24
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              We're going to take a quick break here, but when we come back, I'm in the hot seat.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Take a look and see if you've started sweating.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:07:32
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              They say to never let them see you sweat, well for me, that's about to change. Last year I decided to go pay Professor John Rogers a visit at his lab at Northwestern.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              All right, welcome to our testing facility.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:07:49
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              He had one goal for me.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So we have a portable sauna here. It's going to replicate the environment that you would.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:07:54
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And that's right, in the lab was a portable sauna. Picture of this small tent where your entire body is zipped in, except for your head. And then the temperature inside that tent is cranked up to a cozy about 135 degrees Fahrenheit. And the whole point is to get me to sweat, which you can probably see that I'm starting to do, having been in here for about 15 minutes. Now, while I was in the sauna, Professor Rogers had me wear this small patch that he and his team had designed. This patch sticks straight onto your skin. And then on the backside there are these reservoir channels. If you're looking at it, it basically looks like a semiconductor. Now when a person sweats, or in this case when I sweat, the channels fill with that sweat and turns the patch different colors to correlate with different levels of biomarkers in your body. What is interesting though, is that they're basically trying to measure sweat on my arms here. And you can tell on this one, for example, that I've started to sweat. You can see some sweat on my arm. This is measuring all these different things, ketones, chloride, All these things that you'd normally get tested with a blood draw by sticking a needle in your arm. Now, you don't need to be in...
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Let's take a look and see if.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:09:09
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I'm starting to feel it a little bit, about 12 minutes.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Not much yet on that side, why don't we check the other device. So it's started to fill. There's chloride assays over here, so you're seeing a slight pink color, which means probably chloride concentration around 10 millimolar, 15, something that range. Great job. Thank you.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:09:30
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I sat here and did nothing, literally.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah, yeah. Well, your sweat glands did something. They're working.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:09:39
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Finding a way to actually collect the sweat, that has been the key in studying it. You know, I think it's sort of fascinating. I remember thinking this before I met you, but then sort of reflecting on it afterwards, this idea that we study blood, we have all sorts of different ways of imaging the body. Why weren't we studying sweat all along? It seems like an easy one to sort of study.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I think probably the reason why it hasn't sort of taken off earlier is it's just difficult to collect pristine uncontaminated volumes of sweat. In the early days, you'd use like a device to kind of scrape along the surface of the skin, sort of collect enough sweat that you can get it into a pipette or a syringe or a vial or something like that. The other way to do it is you have like an absorbent pad and a layer of tape on top of it and you kind of put it down and then you peel it off bring the sweat out of the pad, but kind of clumsy approaches overall. So I think that was kind of a missing element, kind of an engineering mechanism for collecting volumes of sweat in a very reliable, reproducible way.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:10:48
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Was it just the, as you call it, the clumsiness that led to this sort of being under-studied, or do you think there was just so much inertia around blood and urine and things like that?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Well, probably a combination of both. I do think there was sort of this missing capacity for collecting tiny volumes of sweat and manipulating those. There's no question that that did not exist prior to maybe 2016 or so. So that was definitely a shift. The other thing may be a broader societal change where there's a greater and greater appreciation of sort of continuous health monitoring using non-invasive sort of wearable devices, you know, whether that's a you know, a watch type device that goes on your wrist or something that goes on your finger or what we've been interested in, sort of soft skin adherent patches, essentially, be placed on anatomically relevant locations of the body for measuring different conditions associated with patient care. And so maybe in that context, it just makes a lot more sense to think about sweat and the ability to kind of capture that biochemical information and sort of a continuous wearable sort of platform. You put it on, sweat enters in. The color develops, you take a smartphone camera, you snap a picture of the device, it does automated color extraction, and the color then calibrates to a specific concentration of those species. So that's the way our devices work. Very simple, sort of single use device construction is the way we have it set up.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:12:21
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So it's not a binary thing because it's not just color changing. You're actually then quantifying what that color means it sounds like.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah, that's right. The vibrancy of that color, the depth of that color correlates directly to a specific concentration level in a continuous manner.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:12:38
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Is the real secret sauce here, this figuring out of the microfluidics, is that what you're alluding to? Yeah.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah, from an engineering standpoint, that's it. But as you've pointed out, really establishing through sort of medical research, what are the correlations between sweat chemistry and blood chemistry? And that's a little bit kind of outside of the domain of the microfluidic device itself, because you can in principle study those correlations with any kind of collection vehicle. I think the microfluentics allows that kind of reproducibility and precision in collecting pristine volumes of samples. Of sweat, but that's more kind of in a biology domain, figuring out those correlations. But then the engineering piece, I think it's already in place.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:13:18
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Well, so when it comes to sweat, then where do you think this is going to go? I mean, are you going to get better if you look at lots and lots of data, for example, blood data and sweat data, and you have these huge machine learning models now, will we get better correlating sweat with blood so that sweat becomes more meaningful? Where is this heading,?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Well, that's a great point. I would say, you know, this kind of machine learning models are gonna be important in really getting a very deep understanding of one's health condition from a combination of biophysical sensor outputs, as well as some of this biochemical information that we're capturing through sweat. And you collect it all together. I think it's gonna be a really powerful opportunity. So I think is a really exciting area for the future. The other thing is a lot of these species just correlate in a very natural way. It doesn't really even require machine learning. Like creatinine and urea we were just talking about, caffeine, alcohol. I think what we will find, we haven't completely proven this, there are a lot micronutrients in sweat. Vitamin C, for example, a number of different essential minerals for a healthy diet appear in sweat as well. We're very interested in pediatric health in that context. You put on a patch, you do kind of almost a full panel analysis of species relevant to a healthy nutrition. But I think there are enough reasons to be interested in sweat, again, biased perspective, that we're plenty motivated. We're gonna continue no matter what. And I think it's a great discovery area in terms of the biology. And there are some immediate applications here that don't even require these correlations to be established.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:14:56
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              What about lipids? Could lipids potentially be measured through sweat like cholesterol or triglycerides or triglycerides?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              That's a good question. We're hoping for cholesterol. We haven't found substantial amounts of it. Cortisol is an interesting one, and we just submitted a new paper on sweat cortisol. As you mentioned, there's a correlation there. The concentrations are super low. I mean, some of the challenge just is related to the very minute concentrations of some of these. More of a kind of an engineering challenge, I guess. Sweat's 99% water. It's only 1% of all of these different chemicals, you know, collected together, so they're very minute in terms of their presence. But amino acids are there, we can capture those. I think it's a really interesting discovery space, like we started talking about. There just hasn't been a lot of work on sweat, but I think a lot of the pieces are there and we're pretty excited about it.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So how has it been going? Are people using it for these purposes?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Well, so great question. So full disclosure, I'm involved in a startup company that has kind of spun out of the academic work that we do kind of in our university lab environment here. I don't have any day-to-day role. I don't have a consulting relationship, anything like that, but I am the board. So it's good to kind of disclose that. But the company is called Epicore Biosystems. And so they have a couple of large sort of customers and business relationships in sports and athletics. And in worker safety. So in those cases, you don't have to worry about correlations to blood because you're tracking sweat loss as a mechanism for determining how much water you've lost as a result of an athletic competition, a training, or if you're in the oil and gas industry, you're working in a hot human environment, you're just sweating. And it also measures electrolyte loss via that same mechanism. And that's important for sports performance because it's well known that poor hydration can lead to cramping and injury and decreased levels of performance. And so the idea is these devices can provide a precise way to determine how much body water you've lost as a result of sweating. And you can use that information to hydrate at appropriate levels. So avoid over hydrating or under hydrating. And by similar token, you can determine how much electrolyte supplement salt tablets you need to take in order to get back to where you were before you lost electrolytes by sweating. And so they have a joint product offering with Gatorade. I don't want to pitch products, but you ask. And so I think they've done about 3 million of these Gatorade, GX patches and There's an app that goes along with the patch. It works exactly the same way that I was just describing. It's a sticker, you put it on, you know, and the channels fill with sweat. You can determine the extent of filling, and then there's a colorimetric reagent. In this case, it responds to chloride concentration, which is pretty much electrostatically balanced with sodium, so it's a good indicator of overall electrolyte concentration. And with the electrolyte consideration, you determine electrolyte loss. And so that guides replenishment.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              But if I wanted to buy one, could I buy one?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah, you can buy them at Dick's Sporting Goods. You can order them off of the Gatorade website. They're bundled in many cases with the GX bottles and the pods and that whole thing. So I think they're about $10 for a pack of two kind of in that.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Well, you know, I just got to say again, when I first heard about your work, it made so much intuitive sense to me that you have sweat as a biofluid, from which we can learn a lot of things about someone's health. And it seems like you've just taken it further and further. It's fascinating to me. It seems to me that it'll just continue to grow.
            &lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;Some OB-GYNs are pushing back against the federal government’s decision not to recommend the COVID shot for pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a tragedy,” said Linda Eckert, MD, in an interview from UW Medicine. “It doesn’t follow the science or the data or the clinical experience we’ve had since COVID has been part of our lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eckert said pregnant women develop more serious symptoms from COVID than women who are not pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They develop more hospitalizations; they have to be in the ICU more often,” she said. “They need the use of a ventilator more often. They even die more often.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;UW doctor outlines importance of COVID vaccine recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eckert insists the vaccine not only reduces the risk of severe illness in pregnant mothers, it protects their newborns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If a pregnant woman develops an immunity to COVID, especially with a vaccine, and she has a high level of antibodies, she passes those on to the infant,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said data show that infants are much less likely to be hospitalized with COVID, within the first six months of life, if their mothers had been vaccinated while pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And she points out that there’s no approved COVID vaccine for babies, six months and younger, yet they face serious complications if infected. In fact, she said they have the same hospitalization rate as adults over the age of 65, yet COVID vaccines are still being recommended for that age group.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
                        
                    &lt;/p&gt;
                
&lt;p&gt;She worries the new government recommendations will discourage insurance companies from covering the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If insurance chooses not to cover this vaccine and people only have the option of paying out of pocket, we know that a lot of people aren’t going to be able to afford it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Junior said he would remove the CDC’s recommendation that children and healthy pregnant women get the COVID vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has since said that children can get COVID shots if their parents first consult their health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;

Made with a blend of eight functional mushrooms, including royal sun, lion’s mane, turkey tail, and others, they somehow avoid an earthy flavor. Actually, they’re raspberry-flavored. They’re vegan, non-GMO, and allergen-free. The mushrooms are grown in the United States, primarily in the Rocky Mountains, using regenerative practices. Plant People is a B Corp and Climate Neutral Certified company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Plant People, the effects (stress relief, better mood, consistent energy levels) build over the first month of consumption. I tried them for five days, which isn’t enough time to say if they “worked,” but it was enough to make me crave more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonus: Across the board, Plant People’s functional mushroom gummies are easy to take, with no bitter aftertaste.

			&lt;p&gt;Not only can the drug &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"&gt;metformin&lt;/a&gt; help to effectively manage type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="163568" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, it may also give older women a better chance of living to the grand old age of 90, according to new research – thanks, it seems, to a variety of anti-aging effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research used data from a long-term US study of postmenopausal women. Records on a total of 438 women were picked out – half who took metformin for their diabetes, and half who took a different &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-confirms-experimental-drug-breaks-record-for-weight-loss-in-clinical-trials"&gt;diabetes drug&lt;/a&gt;, called sulfonylurea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are a lot of caveats and asterisks to the study, those in the metformin group were calculated to have a 30 percent lower risk of dying before the age of 90 than those in the sulfonylurea group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Metformin has been shown to target multiple pathways of aging and therefore has been postulated as a drug that may extend human longevity," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/glaf095"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that metformin initiation increased exceptional longevity compared with sulfonylurea initiation among women with type 2 diabetes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We already know quite a lot about metformin. It's been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-common-diabetes-drug-will-be-trialled-as-an-anti-ageing-elixir-from-next-year"&gt;around for decades&lt;/a&gt;, and is considered a gerotherapeutic: a drug able to slow down various aging processes in the body. For example, it's been shown to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2016.05.011"&gt;limit DNA damage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arr.2022.101621"&gt;promote gene activity&lt;/a&gt; associated with long life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_163572" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-163572" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ElderlyWoman.jpg" alt="Elderly woman" class="wp-image-163572 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ElderlyWoman.jpg 2000w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ElderlyWoman-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ElderlyWoman-738x415.jpg 738w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ElderlyWoman-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ElderlyWoman-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ElderlyWoman-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-163572" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The study used 90 years old as the marker for 'exceptional' longevity. (&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/persons-hand-in-shallow-focus-CeZypKDceQc"&gt;Danie Franco/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown metformin can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-diabetes-medication-slows-brain-aging-in-monkeys"&gt;put the brakes on&lt;/a&gt; wear and tear in the brain, and even reduce the risk &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cheap-diabetes-drug-slashes-risk-of-long-covid-study-finds"&gt;of long COVID&lt;/a&gt;. However, scientists aren't yet sure that the drug extends lifespan, especially in humans – which is part of the reason for this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research can't prove cause and effect like a randomized control trial (RCT) might be able to, because the participants weren't randomly assigned to one treatment or the other – rather, they were following professional advice. What's more, there was no &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo"&gt;placebo group&lt;/a&gt; given no treatment at all. The overall sample size wasn't particularly large, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the study also has its strengths – not least the average 14 to 15 years of follow-up, which goes way beyond the length a standard RCT would be able to. That's important when you're trying to see how lifespan is affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A key advantage of our analysis was the long follow-up period after treatment initiation enabled by examination of a cohort with extensive follow-up from midlife to ages 90 and older, which is not feasible in typical randomized controlled trials," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/glaf095"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RCTs could be something that follows further down the line to dig deeper into these results, the researchers suggest. In the meantime, with the global population continuing to skew older and older, studies continue to find ways of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-30-year-study-may-have-found-the-single-best-diet-for-healthy-aging"&gt;keeping us healthier&lt;/a&gt; for longer, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-how-much-sleep-you-need-for-successful-aging"&gt;reducing damage to the body&lt;/a&gt; as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The geroscience hypothesis posits that biological aging is malleable and that slowing biological aging may delay or prevent the onset of multiple age-related diseases and disability," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/glaf095"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A key goal of geroscience is to identify novel therapeutic and preventive interventions that slow biological aging."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/glaf095"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Gerontology: Medical Sciences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Ontario’s chief medical officer of health, Kieran Moore, said that the infant faced other unrelated medical complications, but confirmed that measles may have been a contributing factor in both the premature birth and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We have not had a measles outbreak in the community, of this size, for as long as I have practiced. Lots of doctors have never seen measles before now,” said Asmaa Hussain, a doctor who is head of paediatrics at the St Thomas Elgin general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hussain said that the true scale of the outbreak may be even larger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There are likely lots and lots of children and families at home who had measles, who never presented to the hospital,” she said. “The tested cases do not capture even a fracture of what has happened in the community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c355fb29-e641-4f21-9f84-900189b30491" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;A sign outside Southwestern Public Health in St Thomas, Ontario, on 4 March 2025.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Geoff Robins/Canadian Press via AP/Alamy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Nearly 40% of cases in Ontario have been reported by the Southwestern Public Health Unit, which services Oxford county, Elgin county and the city of St Thomas, all about a two-hour drive south-west of Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Shocking though the scale of the outbreak may seem, doctors on the frontline and scientists who study public health say that the return of measles was grimly predictable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A confluence of antiquated local public health vaccination strategies, sparse access to family doctors, delays in routine immunization due to Covid-19 and a surge in vaccine hesitancy propelled by online misinformation since the pandemic all have contributed to the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;South-western Ontario is also home to populations of close-knit vaccine-hesitant religious communities who are less exposed to public health messaging, such as Mennonites. The current outbreak has been traced to a Mennonite wedding in New Brunswick, from which a guest returned to Ontario with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Meanwhile, case numbers have also been creeping up in the western province of Alberta, which this week reported a total of 710 confirmed cases, making it the worst year for measles since 1986, when 843 cases were reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Measles is characterized by fever, cough, and a blotchy red, purple or brown widespread rash, and it can result in brain damage, blindness and death in severe cases. It is highly preventable through vaccination, however, and Canada’s goal is for 95% of the population to be immunized against the disease to prevent community spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But the country has dropped below that as first-dose coverage for measles nationally fell from 2019 to 2023, from 90% to 83%, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In St Thomas, Hussain said that this year she has treated many babies younger than 12 months old with measles. Babies under a year are not eligible for the measles vaccine, and Hussain said that in many cases they are infected by unvaccinated older siblings who have picked up the virus from school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hussain also said she had treated an unvaccinated woman who caught the disease from her children before transmitting it to her newborn baby after delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It is illegal to send an unvaccinated child to school in Ontario unless they are immunized against various illnesses, including measles. But, exemptions are possible for valid medical reasons and when vaccination goes against personal religious belief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Also, when unvaccinated families present with measles at healthcare centres, doctors sometimes struggle to even discuss vaccination with the parents, Hussain said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s really hard to even approach the conversation. I would ask: ‘How come you aren’t [vaccinated]?’ And they will say: ‘Oh, we’re exempt’ or ‘We’ve had this discussion before and we just don’t want to,’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dawn Bowdish, an immunologist and professor at McMaster University in Ontario, said while distrust of vaccines has increased, Canada’s&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/06/canada-primary-healthcare-budget-cut-study" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; family doctor crisis&lt;/a&gt; also precipitated the measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;About 20% of Canadians have no family doctor at all, and many more have irregular access to clinicians, so parents do not have easy access to a trusted healthcare professional to discussion vaccinations. Furthermore, the lack of a national vaccine registry means that it can be challenging to know your own vaccination status, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Bowdish also warned that vaccine exemptions were too easily obtained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“One of the challenges is that there’s been a loosening of exemptions as well, so people may not have that faith-based reason, or a reason that’s actually supported by their religion, but just a general sense that they don’t get their kids vaccinated. It’s really hard to balance personal freedoms with public health,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;It’s really hard to balance personal freedoms with public health&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Dawn Bowdish, McMaster University&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Ontario’s Ministry of Health did not respond to a query about vaccine exemptions and strategies to reach religious minority communities. The Southwestern Public Health Unit referred queries to Public Health Ontario, who in turn referred the question to the Southwestern Public Health Unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Various vaccine clinics have been launched across south-western Ontario to ramp up the measles immunization status in the region, though they have not been held at schools. The Ontario government has previously said its teams are on the ground with local public health units, but that convincing vaccine-hesitant people is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kumanan Wilson, a doctor and professor at the University of Ottawa who studies public health policy, said the Covid pandemic heightened anxieties about perceived government overreach – and simultaneously resulted in many people losing direct, frequent access to medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But, he said, focusing on religious communities in the current outbreak could obscure broader concerns that previous methods used by public health agencies to manage illness have lost efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="37af9f54-2a38-4bde-ba34-b48e293f5a05" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":31,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"World may be ‘post-herd immunity’ to measles, top US scientist says","elementId":"37af9f54-2a38-4bde-ba34-b48e293f5a05","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/03/measles-post-herd-immunity"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“They’re going to have to learn to navigate this new world of people not trusting government as much and more populist tendencies. And that’s going to take an adjustment in how we communicate,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Twenty years ago, Wilson carried out &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15811647/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; that found providing accurate public health information actually increased mistrust among the vaccine-hesitant, who said they found it “manipulative”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“You need to find champions within those communities, who believe in what the public health people are telling them, and can communicate that message,” he said. He said Canadian public health has previously focused on shaming those who do not vaccinate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“And in this era, that doesn’t work,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A study by the Angus Reid Institute published at the end of May found that a quarter of Canadians overall do not trust their provincial governments to respond to the measles outbreak adequately. That number was higher in Ontario, at 27%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;That study also found that one in five Canadians with children under 18 are hesitant to vaccinate their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hussain fears that other previously dormant illnesses may return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Measles, when mild, can be managed by physicians like herself. But an illness like polio could result in more dire consequences, including higher rates of death, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“My worry is about the next outbreak. Because there will be a next one coming, right?” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxPQmJJU3lQVTFwaEpfcDRNS1lUc1B2T1h6ZndDTWhEVHo4NFQwa25ZbDViYjZjTW9QN3JVVGVOYl9QdXhqVFl5MHpma29UT3U1UTFkSy01WU5kNWx0ZmZ2MzdHMHhBdG4wMWQ1bHpOTGlNTVNtaVR5Z1I0dmRoUFRCYkdQUQ</guid></item><item><title>前往欧洲度假者的麻疹警告- BBC | Measles warning for holidaymakers heading to Europe - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1OU002dDBvb1RQblBCdzF0bmtzWTdCaWFlTzFhX0RPOThaSmJJdTZMa1MtT0JubXNONUVKdVVhcXlYMF9SVHRmMTZZenYyLTNiT1pGRk1kM1VlZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE5qZFhBUE5McDhyWTNjTGlQc0JsYmN0S1hkY1ZvcFFwNVdxQkZ0anhGVlBIZGM1Z2tuTWpLUzRUV09Zb2ZWRUFvbXZBZnplX2lYMVF3QTNQd1VvaVlxbVRj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;Measles holiday warning as cases rise in Europe&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-801dd632-0 eSlECZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-801dd632-12 jSIeFi"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-801dd632-5 kRoBHa"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-7 lasLGY"&gt;Dominic Hughes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-801dd632-8 hwLppI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Health Correspondent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/668b/live/fa693460-42c3-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/668b/live/fa693460-42c3-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/668b/live/fa693460-42c3-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/668b/live/fa693460-42c3-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/668b/live/fa693460-42c3-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/668b/live/fa693460-42c3-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/668b/live/fa693460-42c3-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/668b/live/fa693460-42c3-11f0-93dd-9f3a34381ccc.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images A child's torso covered in the red spots of a measles rash" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Health experts warn that measles spreads very easily and can lead to some children suffering life-long consequences&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Families travelling abroad this summer on holiday or to visit relatives are being warned about the rise in measles cases in Europe and other regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Measles infections in Europe are at a 25-year high, while cases are also surging in countries such as Pakistan and Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Childhood vaccination rates in the UK that offer protection against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) are still a long way below the recommended 95% uptake, with the lowest regional rates found in London at just over 73% vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The UK Health Security Agency is warning holidaymakers to make sure they are up to date with their vaccinations and stress that it is never too late to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The UKHSA's latest data on measles infections shows that an outbreak is continuing in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Some 109 cases were confirmed in April and 86 so far in May.

This is a fundamental principle of virology,” said Dr. Perry Halkitis, an infectious disease epidemiologist and dean of the Rutgers School of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HO457PACUNDWXGP5Y2WEX6YREY"&gt;“As long as the virus continues to circulate, we will keep seeing new variants,” said Halkitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How quickly will it spread?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FD6Q2LSSEFG73HKIOXIZLNCXVM"&gt;NB.1.8.1 is growing rapidly compared to other variants, according to the WHO. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" data-gaid="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FKIRM6HODVD4PENS62WPPH7BNU"&gt;The virus is more prevalent in other countries than the U.S. right now. But that could quickly change, said Dr. Edward Liu, chief of infectious diseases at Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16" data-gaid="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IG5BOX4FAFAQRFFF2TSDWGCQ4A"&gt;“This has been an international virus from the start,” said Liu. “People sick on airplanes were early transmitters of the virus in the first wave. So, air travel means that international problems are still something that we have to monitor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17" data-gaid="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is this variant more dangerous than others?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DRQ3QJMADRHHXDX7YYUMJD4JXI"&gt;Clinical surveillance data doesn’t indicate any signs of increased severity associated with NB.1.8.1 so far, compared to previously circulating variants, according to the WHO. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-19" data-gaid="inarticle-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZDCI7Y4P75EIFJ47OFSTXCWM24"&gt;Currently, there is no evidence of increased ICU admissions and deaths per hospitalizations. However, that doesn’t mean the virus isn’t a threat, especially to the immunocompromised or the unvaccinated, according to public health experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-20" data-gaid="inarticle-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GO6OZ56Z75BIHH7FMMPPBQRGRE"&gt;“I think natural infection immunity is waning. If the last time you had COVID was years ago, you probably don’t have much immunity. And the last vaccine for a lot of people may have been several years ago,” said Liu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-21" data-gaid="inarticle-21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Does the COVID-19 vaccine protect against new strains?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-22" data-gaid="inarticle-22"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MWFTH3RX45HU7E4J4G2OUUWTWE"&gt;Currently approved COVID-19 vaccines are expected to remain effective against symptomatic and severe disease from this variant, according to the WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-23" data-gaid="inarticle-23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QLADVF4ADVDO7O72WZL672BLOU"&gt;However, the WHO adds, compared to other variants circulating, NB.1.8.1 has mutations that could increase the variant’s transmissibility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-24" data-gaid="inarticle-24"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UFTE4KTFX5GWPEL7PSGPW3T2BQ"&gt;“This one stood out because vaccine-created antibodies may be slightly less effective neutralizing these viruses than some other variants,” Liu said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-25" data-gaid="inarticle-25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CQZYNISN2RFDTK5IZZ3KNWTDU4"&gt;The CDC recently updated its COVID-19 vaccine recommendations. The agency no longer recommends vaccines for healthy children under 18 and for pregnant women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-26" data-gaid="inarticle-26"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Will it increase this summer?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-27" data-gaid="inarticle-27"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="U5FJC7R4ABEBTMOLNVTQYAEOJY"&gt;Don’t cancel those summer plans just yet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-28" data-gaid="inarticle-28"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AOWTAQVH7FBO7KXBP5OCOF5CRQ"&gt;“It’s unlikely that this variant will ‘ruin’ the summer, especially because warmer months bring more outdoor activity and better ventilation, which reduce transmission risk,” said Halkitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-29" data-gaid="inarticle-29"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KWVQKL2KEFHUFDERYORSG4JBOM"&gt;The real concern, Halkitis said, will come in the fall when people begin to gather indoors again—in schools, offices, and other enclosed spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-30" data-gaid="inarticle-30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OG2JUN2BGFDB3HH6T6MK6RDDKU"&gt;“COVID-19 remains a real and ongoing threat,” said Halkitis, adding that vaccines remain the greatest defense against illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-31" data-gaid="inarticle-31"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4T4NXCMPAFECVJHM4LZSB4WKVA"&gt;“Vaccines work and have enhanced our longevity and quality of life,” said Halkitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-32" data-gaid="inarticle-32"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:WPZPY4XKJBFAZN5OMPMP6C3MA4" data-fusion-component="WPZPY4XKJBFAZN5OMPMP6C3MA4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:WPZPY4XKJBFAZN5OMPMP6C3MA4" data-fusion-component="WPZPY4XKJBFAZN5OMPMP6C3MA4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-33" data-gaid="inarticle-33"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UXESSRZKFBD5JAMPEYPTUENNM4"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

A founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, Calif., Dr. Topol is also the author of a New York Times bestselling new &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Super-Agers/Eric-Topol/9781668067666" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;book&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “Super Agers: An Evidence Based Approach to Longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently sat down with Topol to discuss his book’s insights into slowing down, or turning back, our aging clocks to become more like super agers — or who he calls the “Wellderly” — people who live well into their 80s and 90s without any chronic illness or disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive answer to that question requires reading his book, written for a lay audience curious about the latest (and upcoming) scientific breakthroughs in longevity medicine. But in our hour-long conversation, Topol discussed several do’s and don’ts for anyone seeking to make 80 the new 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="1-do-strengthen-your-immune-system" class="subhead"&gt;1. Do: Strengthen your immune system&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is one main thesis to Topol’s book, it’s that healthy aging is a function of a strong immune system, which can defend against diabetes, cancer, heart disease and other chronic conditions. “I keep saying to myself that old thing about the economy: ‘It’s the immune system, stupid,’ you know?” Topol told me. “Because it really is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He suggests focusing on habits that support and build immune health:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular strength and resistance training builds strong immune systems and is the single best way to extend lifespan and, importantly, health span.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep a Mediterranean-style diet that maximizes whole foods, colorful vegetables, lean meats, olive oil and minimal dairy, and minimizes ultra-processed food.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get deep, restorative sleep — crucial for supporting your body’s immune function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain so-called “lifestyle+” factors, like spending time in nature, avoiding environmental pollution like food-borne plastics and airborne toxins, and maintaining strong friendships and a regular social calendar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll go deeper into some of these specific strategies, like sleep and nutrition, below. But the common denominator is supporting a robust immune function, Topol said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We should be having immune system testing as we get older,” he said, “because it is the reason why aging can hurt us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="2-dont-limit-your-medical-care-to-only-what-your-insurance-covers" class="subhead"&gt;2. Don’t: Limit your medical care to only what your insurance covers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most employer-provided health insurance programs cover only the minimum annual tests to gauge basic heart health and disease risks, cholesterol level and hormone health. “Standard medicine is missing out, leaving too many unsolved questions about a person’s risk,” Topol said. “Just do the tests based on a person’s risk; the yield is much higher.“ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recommends a few lower-cost, specific tests to help personalize medical care and guide preventive strategies that can help flag potential disease risks that most insurance-covered tests do not:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS): Often costing fewer than $50, these tests provide validated risk estimates for common cancers (e.g., prostate, breast, lung, colorectal, melanoma) and other diseases. Use this test alongside other health data, like family history and routine blood tests, to provide a more comprehensive risk assessment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DEXA scans: Typically costing less than $100, this is a relatively inexpensive and useful tool for monitoring changes in body composition, such as muscle and fat mass, or older adults concerned about muscle loss. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sequencing your genome: For about $200, this process can help determine which, if any, cancers you may be most predisposed to. This is a test you need to take only once, for lifelong knowledge. Caveat: Unfortunately, most of the validated datasets for genomic cancer risk are still for people of European ancestry only.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="3-do-nourish-your-gut-brain-axis" class="subhead"&gt;3. Do: Nourish your “gut-brain axis”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In “Super Agers,” Topol writes at length about the bidirectional communication between gut hormones and the brain, and calls it critical to healthy immune function. Gut hormones are chemical messengers made by special cells in the digestive tract that help control digestive functions. They communicate with the brain through the bloodstream and the vagus nerve, which runs through the throat and vocal cords and connects the gut and brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m pretty well-convinced now that the gut hormone story is the most extraordinary thing I’ve ever seen in medical intervention,” he told me. “Because the gut hormones talk to the immune system, and they talk to the brain, which is mission control for the immune system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It isn’t just the microbiome, it’s the gut’s hormone production,” he said. “The way to a person’s brain and to healthy aging, it likely will be through their gut.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to nourish the two-way communication along the so-called gut-brain axis:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain a strong and diverse gut microbiome: Consume a variety of whole foods (meat, grains, legumes, dark leafy greens), and minimize ultra-processed foods (i.e., anything with a long list of ingredients you can’t pronounce). Foods with active macrobiotic cultures like yogurt, kimchi, sauerkraut and kombucha are great for building healthy, diverse gut bacteria.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stimulate and strengthen your vagus nerve. Care for it via deep-breathing exercises that engage the diaphragm. Singing, humming, laughing and even gargling stimulate the vagus nerve, and cold-water exposure can activate it and enhance its tone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="4-dont-sleep-too-little-or-too-much" class="subhead"&gt;4. Don’t: Sleep too little — or too much&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all know that getting enough sleep is critical to health and specifically to healthy aging, and many doctors rightfully call Americans’ chronic lack of proper sleep a public health crisis. But there’s another side to the sleep story, Topol said, admitting his own surprise: According to plenty of &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00210-2" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;clinical research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for people in their late 30s and older, getting more than seven to eight hours of sleep was associated with greater mortality risks, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The principal finding was that about seven hours is the optimal duration of sleep,” he writes in his book. “Every one-hour-a-night increase in sleep duration above that seven- to eight-hour threshold is associated with 12%  higher risk of total cardiovascular disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To improve sleep function, Topol recommends maintaining a consistent bedtime and waking schedule, and avoiding eating or drinking alcohol for a few hours before sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="5-do-use-ai-to-answer-health-aging-questions-but-with-caution" class="subhead"&gt;5. Do: Use AI to answer health aging questions — but with caution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The convergence of AI with advances in biomedical data — such as genomics, microbiome analysis and digital health monitoring — create a transformative force that can radically improve disease prediction, prevention and personalized care, Topol told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For consumers, AI is a powerful tool, he said, that can still be grossly mistaken, sometimes. So with caution and vigilance for AI “hallucinations” that provide flat-out wrong information, here’s how you can use it to help you age with strength:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leverage personal health data: Consider feeding consumer AI apps like Claude (Anthropic), Gemini (Google) and Perplexity your anonymized data from wearable devices, mobile health apps and at-home testing kits for real-time feedback and personalized recommendations. Maintaining proper digital privacy means scrubbing personally identifying information like your name, address and social security number from any documents you upload to AI platforms. (Assume personally identifying data you provide an AI system may be captured by the company that owns it.) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make AI your personal food and beverage analyst: The more specific you can get about which foods you consume and how much, the more AI can give you an accurate idea of how balanced your diet is compared to nutritional standards. I’ve done this and received eye-opening feedback. Always ask the AI system what nutrition standards it’s using, and don’t be afraid to challenge results that don’t sound right. (Some AI can be good at admitting when it’s wrong.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask AI for non-technical explanations of emerging longevity trends, treatments and scientific breakthroughs. For instance, ask Perplexity, “Why are doctors so excited about GLP-1s now?” What it replies may well surprise you. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixAFBVV95cUxOODVCb2JFaF96T2gxZ2g4d2FLRUthSU40eTJTQzlHa0dfSldLR2NmRlIybWF2b1kzWmxMNHJwQTE3YXFoYWhqUXA0MkNiamFUWlRlYk9nenY0VlBkbmU5N3ExZTZTN0pwUU1WejdibU83b1lMMFZ0Z004Vk1yakN1dDd6Vnd3MG4tc3JEYkw0cmN3YU5Gcjd2UlRVQ0NEb0ptR1Rpd0l0cl9WT2JFZkdzNkhHTEoyT3JZTWFackFrWWRDcEhZ</guid></item><item><title>忘记“生物年龄”测试—长寿专家正在使用800美元的雷达下血液测试来实时测量衰老- Business Insider | Forget 'biological age' tests — longevity experts are using an $800 under-the-radar blood test to measure aging in real-time - Business Insider</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxNY0tvaHFlVnVIUl9tS180N002VC1RM0VWdHE1V1dnNVBaaWpVYUIzT25RS1VhWnREd2Y0d0E3VXg0dm1ObnJhMk1pYVhGZEwxN090c2RUYk5HTzBIMUx1eHB4enpDYno5eHBpa3dhNUFsVDgxdEhJRXd2MGllb3FNVjIzTGs4WkI4ZjJfN0ozeVNQejNMYllOeWtIcmtCTHA3ZnktQWl3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="post-body-content post-story-body-content" data-component-type="post-body-content" data-load-strategy="exclude" data-track-content="" data-post-type="story" data-track-marfeel="post-body-content"&gt;

"You see the relationship with women's hormones. You see the relationship with food and alcohol. You don't ever get that with genes."&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;A test like this isn't available to consumers just yet, but it's already being used by researchers at elite universities and high-end longevity clinics. They hope it can become a tool any doctor could use to assess patient health in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A startup called Vero, which was spun out of some foundational proteomics research at Stanford University, is hoping to beta test a proteomics product for consumers this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Knowing your oldest organ isn't the point; changing the trajectory is," Vero co-founder and CEO Paul Coletta told a crowd gathered at the Near Future Summit in Malibu, California, last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coletta told Business Insider Vero's not interested in doing "wealthcare." The company plans to make its test available to consumers for around $200 a pop, at scale. Their draw only requires one vial of blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="50784475-553f-4a01-b48d-c925d6008fec" data-toc-id="50784475-553f-4a01-b48d-c925d6008fec"&gt;Why measuring proteins could be the key to better personalized medicine&lt;/h2&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The big promise of proteomics is that it could be a more precise real-time tool for tracking important but subtle changes that emerge inside each of us as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic testing can measure how our bodies are built, spotting vulnerabilities in a person's DNA that might predispose them to health issues. Standard clinical measurements like a person's weight, blood pressure, or cholesterol readings are a useful proxy for potential health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there are the increasingly popular "biological age" tests available to consumers at home. Most of those look at "epigenetic changes" — how environmental factors affect our gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proteomics does something different and new. It measures the product that our bodies make based on all those genetic and environmental inputs: proteins. It offers a live assessment of how your body is running, not just how it's programmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If validated in the next few years, these tests could become key in early disease detection and prevention. They could help influence all kinds of medical decisions, from big ones like "What drugs should I take?" to little ones like "How does my body respond to caffeine or alcohol?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="4e0e67e9-fd6f-4ee4-b09d-b4a0657b6a3c" data-toc-id="4e0e67e9-fd6f-4ee4-b09d-b4a0657b6a3c"&gt;Elite longevity clinics already use proteomics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some high-end &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-longevity-clinic-executive-physical-2024-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;longevity clinics&lt;/a&gt; are already forging ahead using proteomics to guide clinical recommendations, albeit cautiously.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Dr. Andrea Maier, a professor of medicine and functional aging at the National University of Singapore, told BI she uses this measurement all the time in her longevity clinics. For her, it's just a research tool, but if the results of her ongoing studies are decent, she hopes to be able to use it clinically in a few years' time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to know what kind of 'ageotype' a person is, so what type of aging personality are you, not from a mental perspective, but from a physical perspective," Maier said. "It's really discovery at this moment in time, and at the edge of being clinically meaningful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once we have that validated tool, we will just add it to our routine testing and we can just tick the box and say, 'I also want to know if this person is a cardiac ager, or a brain ager, or a muscle ager' because now we have a sensitive parameter — protein — which can be added," Maier said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two big-name proteomics tests are Olink and SOMAscan. For now, their high-end &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/abstract/S1550-4131(24)00401-7" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;screening&lt;/a&gt; costs around $400-$800 per patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm losing lots of money at the moment because of proteomics for clinical research!" Maier said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="1bdcf7c9-1358-4c80-adde-4dd13b082ba1" data-toc-id="1bdcf7c9-1358-4c80-adde-4dd13b082ba1"&gt;Proteomics could soon help predict who's most likely to get certain cancers, fast-tracking both prevention and treatment&lt;/h2&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Top aging researchers at Stanford and Harvard are pushing the field forward, racing to publish more novel insights about the human proteome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest findings from Harvard aging researcher Vadim Gladyshev's lab, published earlier this year, suggest that as we age, each person may even stand to benefit from a slightly different antiaging grocery list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To research this idea, Gladyshev looked at proteins in the blood of more than 50,000 people in the UK, all participants in the UK Biobank who are being &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/enable-your-research/about-our-data" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;regularly tested and studied&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about their long-term health. He tracked their daily habits and self-reported routines like diet, occupation, and prescriptions, comparing those details to how each patient's organs were aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He discovered some surprising connections. Yogurt eating, generally speaking, tended to be associated with better intestinal aging but had relatively no benefit to the arteries. White wine drinking, on the other hand, seemed to potentially confer some small benefit to the arteries while wreaking havoc on the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;​​"The main point is that people age in different ways in different organs, and therefore we need to find personalized interventions that would fit that particular person," Gladyshev told BI. "Through measuring proteins, you assess the age of different organs and you say, 'OK, this person is old in this artery.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, there's too much noise in the data to do more. Dr. Pal Pacher, a senior investigator at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism who studies organ aging and injuries, told BI that proteomics is simply not ready for clinical use yet. There's just too much noise in the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he imagines a future where a more sophisticated protein clock could help link up which people may be most vulnerable to diseases like early cancer, kidney disease, and more.

for weight-loss reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Originally created as a method to aid in the management of type two diabetes, the drug family works by mimicking a hormone called GLP-1, which regulates the body's blood sugar and appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;As the hormone levels rise in your brain it tricks the body into being full, alongside reducing the amount of glucose produced in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Which means not only are GLP-1 (Ozempic, Wegovy) and GLP-1 and GIP (Mounjaro) good for controlling diabetes, but they also help with weight management, although it's important to note that Ozempic has not been FDA approved for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;And it seems like everyone from &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/celebrity"&gt;A-listers&lt;/a&gt;

Her doctors put it down to a rare disorder she had that caused her lungs to become chronically inflamed. "No worry, it must be that," she was told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;When she finally had an X-ray, a shadow was detected on her lung. "That set the ball rolling," Martha recalls. "First, a CT scan was done, then a bronchoscopy [a procedure that involves using a long tube to inspect the airways in a person's lungs] to take tissue samples." After the tumour was removed, about four months after she'd first reported symptoms to her GP, she received the diagnosis: &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/lung-cancer/stages-types-grades/stage-3" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Stage IIIA lung cancer&lt;/a&gt;. The tumour had infiltrated the surrounding lymph nodes but had not yet spread to distant organs. Martha was 59 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It was a total shock," says Martha. Although she would occasionally light up a cigarette at a party, she never considered herself a smoker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Lung cancer is the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.wcrf.org/preventing-cancer/cancer-statistics/lung-cancer-statistics/#:~:text=Lung%20cancer%20is%20the%20most,most%20common%20cancer%20in%20women." class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;most common cancer worldwide&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lung-cancer" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;leading cause of cancer death&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://gco.iarc.who.int/media/globocan/factsheets/populations/900-world-fact-sheet.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;In 2022&lt;/a&gt;, about 2.5 million people were diagnosed with the disease and more than &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://gco.iarc.fr/today/en/dataviz/pie?mode=population&amp;amp;group_populations=0&amp;amp;cancers=15&amp;amp;types=1" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;1.8 million&lt;/a&gt; died. Although tobacco-related lung cancers still account for the majority of diagnoses worldwide, smoking rates have been &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news/item/16-01-2024-tobacco-use-declines-despite-tobacco-industry-efforts-to-jeopardize-progress" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;declining&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2833289" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;for several decades&lt;/a&gt;. As the number of smokers continues to fall in many countries around the world, the proportion of lung cancer occurring in people who have never smoked is on the rise. Between &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/lung-cancer-never-smokers" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;10 and 20%&lt;/a&gt; of lung cancer diagnoses are now made in individuals who have never smoked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Lung cancer in never-smokers is emerging as a separate disease entity with distinct molecular characteristics that directly impact treatment decisions and outcomes," says Andreas Wicki, an oncologist at the University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland. While the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38195910/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;average age at diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; is similar to that of smoking-related lung cancers, younger patients with lung cancer are more likely to have never smoked. "When we see 30- or 35-year-olds with lung cancer, they are usually never-smokers," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Another difference is the type of cancer being diagnosed. Until the 1950s and 1960s, the most common form of lung cancer was &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8639747" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;squamous cell carcinoma&lt;/a&gt; – a type which begins with the cells that line the lungs. In contrast, lung cancer in never-smokers is almost exclusively &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519578/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;adenocarcinoma&lt;/a&gt; – a type which starts in mucus-producing cells – which is now the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(24)00428-4/abstract" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;most common form&lt;/a&gt; of lung cancer in both smokers and never-smokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Like other forms of lung cancer, adenocarcinoma is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage. "If there's a 1cm (0.4in) tumour hidden somewhere in your lungs, you won't notice it," says Wicki. The early symptoms, which include persistent coughing, chest pain, shortness of breath or wheezing, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4375-lung-cancer" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;often only appear&lt;/a&gt; when the tumour is larger or has spread. In addition, the historically strong link between smoking and lung cancer may inadvertently lead non-smokers to attribute symptoms to other causes, says Wicki. "Most cases in never-smokers are therefore only diagnosed at stage 3 or 4."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images The smoke from cooking fuel and fumes from cooking oil can increase a person's risk of lung disease, including lung cancer (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;The smoke from cooking fuel and fumes from cooking oil can increase a person's risk of lung disease, including lung cancer (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Lung cancer in never-smokers is also more common in women. Women who have never smoked are more than &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://go2.org/wp-content/uploads/GO2-WLC-Facts-0823.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;twice as likely&lt;/a&gt; to develop lung cancer as male never-smokers. Aside from &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/why-is-there-an-increase-in-lung-cancer-among-women-who-have-never-smoked-249406" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;lung anatomy and environmental exposures&lt;/a&gt;, at least part of the answer may lie in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/s44321-024-00175-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;genetic mutations&lt;/a&gt; that are more common in women, especially in Asian women. One of the most prevalent is a mutation known as EGFR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Lung cancer cells in people who have never smoked usually have a number of mutations that could be causing their cancer, explains Wicki – so-called driver mutations. These &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/lung-cancer/symptoms-diagnosis/biomarker-testing/egfr" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;genetic changes drive tumour growth&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/1568026620666200303123102" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;EGFR&lt;/a&gt; gene which codes for a protein on the surface of cells and is called epidermal growth factor receptor. The reasons why these driver mutations are more frequently found in female patients, particularly those of Asian descent, are not entirely understood. There is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3391698/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;some evidence&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8524770/#sec12-15353702211019697" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;female hormones&lt;/a&gt; may play a role, with certain genetic variants that affect oestrogen metabolism being more prevalent in East Asians. This could potentially explain the higher incidence of EGFR-mutant lung cancer in Asian women, although the data is very preliminary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Following the discovery of mutations which can lead to lung cancer in non-smokers, the pharmaceutical industry began to develop drugs that specifically block the activity of those proteins. For example, the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://scholarworks.indianapolis.iu.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/46cb7e85-0b8b-46d3-b5b2-fecd68c8b3e1/content" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;first EGFR inhibitors&lt;/a&gt; became available around 20 years ago and most patients showed an impressive response. However, treatment often led to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2670612/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;resistant cancer cells&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in tumour relapse. In recent years, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41571-024-00971-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;much effort&lt;/a&gt; has been put into overcoming this problem, with &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39366135/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;newer types of drugs&lt;/a&gt; now entering the market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As a result, the prognosis for patients has steadily improved. "The median survival rate of patients who carry such driver mutations is now several years," Wicki explains. "We have patients who have been on targeted therapy for more than 10 years. This is a huge step forward when you consider that the median survival rate was less than 12 months about 20 years ago." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As the proportion of lung cancer in never-smokers increases, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44276-023-00006-w" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;experts say&lt;/a&gt; it is crucial to develop prevention strategies for this population. A number of risk factors have been implicated. For example, studies have revealed that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9264880/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;radon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4126868/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;second-hand smoke&lt;/a&gt; can elevate the risk of lung cancer in non-smokers. Additionally, exposure to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4232458/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;cooking fumes&lt;/a&gt; or to stoves burning wood or coal in poorly ventilated rooms may also increase this risk. Since women traditionally spend more time indoors, they are particularly vulnerable to this type of indoor air pollution. However, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7904962/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;outdoor air pollution&lt;/a&gt; is an even more significant factor in the development of lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Particulate air pollution can increase a person's risk of developing lung cancer (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Particulate air pollution can increase a person's risk of developing lung cancer (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In fact, outdoor air pollution is the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2023.05.024" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;second leading cause of all lung cancer cases&lt;/a&gt; after smoking. Studies have revealed that people who &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-025-02999-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;live in highly polluted areas&lt;/a&gt; are more likely to die of lung cancer than those who do not. Particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter (about a 30th of the width of a human hair), typically found in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10543654/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;vehicle exhaust&lt;/a&gt; and fossil fuel smoke, seems to play an important role. And intriguingly,  &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.esmo.org/press-releases/scientists-discover-how-air-pollution-may-trigger-lung-cancer-in-never-smokers" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;research has shown&lt;/a&gt; a strong link between high levels of PM2.5 and lung cancer in individuals who have never smoked and who carry an EGFR mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;At least one study has shown an association between wildfire exposure and increased incidence of lung cancer – Christine Berg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;How air pollution may trigger lung cancer in never-smokers carrying the EGFR mutation has been the focus of research at the Francis Crick Institute in London. "When we think about environmental carcinogens, we usually think about them as causing mutations in the DNA", says William Hill, a post-doctoral researcher in the cancer evolution and genome instability laboratory of the Francis Crick Institute. Cigarette smoke, for example, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6546629/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;damages our DNA&lt;/a&gt;, thus leading to lung cancer. "However, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37020004/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;our [2023] study&lt;/a&gt; proposes that PM2.5 doesn't directly mutate DNA, rather it wakes up dormant mutant cells sitting in our lungs and starts them on the early stages of lung cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In their experiments, the researchers showed that air pollutants are taken up by immune cells called macrophages. These cells normally protect the lung by ingesting infectious organisms. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10213952/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;In response to PM2.5 exposure&lt;/a&gt;, macrophages release chemical messengers known as cytokines, which wake up cells carrying the EGFR mutation and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/s44321-024-00175-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;causes them to proliferate&lt;/a&gt;. "Both air pollution and EGFR mutations are needed for tumours to grow," says Hill. Understanding how PM2.5 acts on the microenvironment of cells carrying EGFR mutations to promote tumour growth, he adds, could pave the way for new approaches to preventing lung cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The association between air pollution and lung cancer is not new. In a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/2/4682/739" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;landmark paper&lt;/a&gt; establishing the link between smoking and lung cancer in 1950, the authors suggested outdoor pollutants from the burning of fossil fuels as a possible cause. But policies to date have focused almost exclusively on tobacco control. But 75 years later, air pollution is finally coming into focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;…99% of the world population lives in areas where air pollution levels exceed WHO guideline limits – Ganfeng Luo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Air pollution levels &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://phys.org/news/2024-03-air-quality-europe-significant-decades.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;in Europe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43492-9" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the US&lt;/a&gt; have fallen in recent decades. But the effect of changes on lung cancer rates has not yet become apparent. "It probably takes 15 to 20 years for changes in exposure to be reflected in lung cancer rates, but we don't know for sure," says Christine Berg, a retired oncologist from the National Cancer Institute in Maryland, US. Moreover, the picture is not static: climate change is likely to have an impact in the future. "With the increasing risk of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21708-0" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;wildfires&lt;/a&gt;, air pollution and PM2.5 levels are rising again in certain regions of the US," says Berg. "At least &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542519622000675" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; has shown an association between wildfire exposure and increased incidence of lung cancer. Transitioning away from coal, oil and gas is therefore crucial not only to slow global warming but also to improve air quality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In 2021, the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/what-are-the-who-air-quality-guidelines" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;WHO halved&lt;/a&gt; the annual mean air quality guideline for PM2.5, meaning it has adopted a more stringent approach to particulate matter. "But 99% of the world population lives in areas where air pollution levels exceed [these updated] WHO guideline limits," says Ganfeng Luo, a postdoctoral researcher at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in Lyon, France. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(24)00428-4/abstract" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt;, IARC researchers estimated that approximately 194,000 cases of lung adenocarcinoma worldwide were attributable to PM2.5 in 2022.

"But not all of these cases will be in never-smokers," says Harriet Rumgay, an epidemiologist and a co-author of the study. Adenocarcinoma also occurs in smokers, especially in those using filtered cigarettes. "There's still a lot we don't know," says Rumgay. "More research is needed to disentangle the different factors and also to understand, for example, how long you would need to be exposed to air pollution before developing lung cancer." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As treatments continue to improve, lung cancer in never-smokers is becoming more survivable.

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;While exercising and eating well is not only important for staying healthy, research shows it may also give you an upper hand in the fight against cancer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://cancer.ca/en/about-us/media-releases/2025/exercise-improves-survival-for-colon-cancer"&gt;latest study&lt;/a&gt; funded by the Canadian Cancer Society followed people who were prescribed a 3-year exercise program after treatment for colorectal cancer. It found that those who received the program had both a 28% lower risk of recurrence of the disease and new cancer — plus, a 37% lower risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Bires, a specialist in psychological oncology and executive director of the Peterson Life with Cancer program at Inova’s Schar Cancer Institute, said studies on other forms of cancer, such as melanoma, are also showing the importance of diet and exercise during treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Incorporating a healthy lifestyle before you get cancer, during treatment or even into survivorship, can be a really key component of increasing quality of life, longevity and feeling better,” Bires said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said both exercise and nutrition have been shown to help with fatigue, quality of life, and adhering to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bires noted that the field has shifted, as more cancer doctors include diet and exercise to patient treatment plans. According to Bires, one issue — historically — is research money not being available for studies on the effects of nutrition and working out following cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think what’s complicated is that food is not a drug company, and so oftentimes there’s not a lot of funding for research in these areas, but definitely people are becoming more and more interested, and we’re seeing more and more data come out on the impact of a healthy diet and nutrition and how it can impact prevention as well as treatment,” Bires said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to exercise, Bires recommends those battling cancer should keep moving as much as they can during treatment, and that they get back to it as fast as they can after completing treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whether it’s doing walking, gentle weight lifting, yoga and stretching, moving our bodies is really important for a number of reasons,” Bires said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bires added that more data is showing inflammatory foods and foods with additives don’t help those fighting cancer, but that whole foods — including vegetables, fruits and whole grains — do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do imagine that we’re going to see more and more studies coming out that show how nutrition and the gut microbiome impacts treatment and really quality of life while receiving treatment into survivorship,” Bires said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important way to help yourself during a cancer battle is by lowering stress levels, Bires said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said when it comes to starting an exercise and diet routine, whether it be during cancer treatment or to prevent cancer, it’s okay to start out small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Maybe start with going on a walk each day or replacing one unprocessed food with a vegetable or fruit, and also creating some accountability. Anytime that we can exercise with friends or share recipes and really creating some accountability, that can be helpful for some of these habits,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bires said there isn’t one strategy for getting started that works for everyone, but instead the goal is to begin “creating habits.” Also, don’t let missed days derail your plan entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re all going to miss days or have missteps, but we want to make sure that we’re doing these things the majority of the time,” Bires said.&lt;/p&gt;

He thinks he got it from his high school girlfriend — now his wife — who once he got sick would ring the doorbell, drop off his homework and run away before he could get to the door. “She was afraid I might give her something,” said Cohen, who was laid low for a week with a fever, sore throat and swollen glands. “I’m certain it actually came from her.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="media-ui-Paragraph_text-SqIsdNjh0t0-" data-component="paragraph"&gt;That teenage case of mono, also known as glandular fever, would make a lasting impression. Five decades later, Cohen is now chief of the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases inside the National Institutes of Health, where he’s leading efforts to create a vaccine for Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV, which causes mono.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Bloomberg</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 08:00:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxOQWd2UFd3SS1jekVPaWFOOGpxbk55R05STmVHZGFuWkVkZFJVekFqbzB1UTJENWNmMlpyZm1zeFdJZHQ2Ul9kVTRtNXdFTW5oU0V3NW8wS3JqVzIzYjc0cTBTbnVlcmQ5QjNWLUIzV2NUeWJHSVpncWx0LTlYeHNqMTZWZWJ1a0hPb1BITVVCeE5GNkVlUUVldkhlMnFENEF2ZUtlazV4VGhVbUlzUWhnNTJXeXc5cUNfUmxyNkpMdw</guid></item></channel></rss>
