But a new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is raising awareness of ways to lower that risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2746dd" class="body-graf"&gt;The study points to five risk factors that public health officials — and, in some cases, women themselves — can do something about: obesity, diabetes, smoking exposure, food insecurity and low levels of folate (an essential vitamin that helps the body produce cells).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3f3b48" class="body-graf"&gt;According to the study, 66% of women ages 12 to 49 have at least one of these risk factors, and 10% have three or more. The CDC’s findings, &lt;a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(25)00438-6/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, are based on responses from 5,374 women who completed the agency’s National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2007 to 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-59ba56" class="body-graf"&gt;“We can’t underscore enough how important it is to raise awareness about these risk factors and encourage women to speak with their doctors if they have any concerns or questions before becoming pregnant,” Arick Wang, a health scientist at the CDC and the lead author of the new study, said via email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-39d619" class="body-graf"&gt;She added that the “risks can be lowered through steps like getting the recommended 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid daily, healthy diet and exercise, and managing blood sugar.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2769f9" class="body-graf"&gt;Birth defects are the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/maternal-infant-health/infant-mortality/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;leading cause of death in infants&lt;/a&gt;, according to CDC data. The risks often start before some women even know they’re pregnant. Though the causes of birth defects are largely a mystery, scientists generally recognize that some combination of genetics, environment and lifestyle factors is responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-160a62" class="body-graf"&gt;“This should be a wake up call to all of us,” said Dr. Michael Warren, chief medical and health officer of March of Dimes, a nonprofit research and advocacy group focused on maternal and infant health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d34eb2" class="body-graf"&gt;“We want to make sure that people have access to nutritious foods,” said Warren, who wasn’t involved in the study. “We want to make sure that people have safe places to be physically active.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fe2186" class="body-graf"&gt;People with food insecurity can be deficient in nutrients that are vital for a fetus’ organs to develop properly, including folate. For instance, low concentrations of folate in the blood are associated with neural tube defects — brain or spine defects that develop in the first month of pregnancy. Doctors recommend that people who are pregnant or trying to get pregnant take folic acid, the synthetic version of folate.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d50f31" class="body-graf"&gt;Since 1998, the Food and Drug Administration has required that enriched cereal-grain products be fortified with folic acid. Wang, the CDC scientist, said in a press release that the policy likely prevents more than 1,300 babies each year from being born without neural tube defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4353b2" class="body-graf"&gt;“The vast majority of birth defects that occur, we still don’t know why they occur,” Nembhard said. “Even when women do everything right — they don’t smoke, they don’t drink during pregnancy, they monitor caffeine intake, they exercise — you can still have an outcome that is not what you wanted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1f3cdb" class="body-graf"&gt;Warren, who until June served as associate administrator of HHS’ Maternal and Child Health Bureau, said many women might not be aware that conditions like obesity and food insecurity are also risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7c841b" class="body-graf"&gt;Obesity, which affected roughly one-third of the women surveyed, was the most common modifiable risk factor in the CDC study. Scientists aren’t exactly clear on why it’s linked to birth defects, but they suspect it has something to do with changes to a woman’s metabolism — such as the way her body manages insulin and glucose — that may lead to abnormal development in the fetus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-90f59a" class="body-graf"&gt;“When [our] cells are growing and forming organs, we really rely on everything to be working just as it should. And when you disrupt those processes, things can go awry,” Warren said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f0317b" class="body-graf"&gt;High blood sugar from diabetes may also lead to abnormal organ development, he said. And some of the chemicals in cigarette smoke, including nicotine, can reduce the supply of oxygen to the fetus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8a0cc2" class="body-graf"&gt;Warren said there’s more to be done. He pointed to Mississippi, which &lt;a href="https://msdh.ms.gov/page/23,30305,341.html" target="_blank"&gt;declared a public health emergency&lt;/a&gt; last week over its high infant mortality rates and pledged to eliminate “care deserts,” where women don’t have access to obstetricians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-df275c" class="body-graf"&gt;Outside researchers lauded the study’s release amid layoffs and proposed funding cuts to the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-976572" class="body-graf"&gt;“We’re delighted that this study has been ongoing. There were some questions about whether or not it would continue,” said Wendy Nembhard, director of the Arkansas Center for Birth Defects Research and Prevention at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7d8bba" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services in March &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restructuring-doge-fact-sheet.html" target="_blank"&gt;announced the termination of 2,400 CDC employees&lt;/a&gt;. However, a federal judge &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.rid.59507/gov.uscourts.rid.59507.89.0.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;issued a preliminary ruling&lt;/a&gt; on Aug. 12 that blocked the layoffs for certain CDC programs, including the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities — the group behind the new study. At least 600 CDC employees are still &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-layoffs-827585f95b24d7dfdf99dd453960a991" target="_blank"&gt;expected to receive permanent termination notices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 04:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxQcW9BMDdDWXFzMGJkRUs2bElMTGhmUXJmalFRZnZKTWc2dU5iYnU4Z0FhYUdEMWhFZ0V3RURvM3dTbU5FdURvQ0gxRXJSTnJYR3FDV0x1N0VBem9MeGRtNXRELUkwOHVoRjFwWXZPTElITU85dVRCMDJHakJycGJOejFmVWF1WDQwbmNBS19kV21iRHIwWE4xWUJhRlY4Z3IwYS1aYnFhejRtUWZpeXV3Y1gyTdIBVkFVX3lxTFBTUUhXNDEwdVNyZUROTEZVTUI0S0ZMZG1DX2phTzVpSnlQcmxmUWFZemJJV1VtMEo5cld0bjBWc3VVQmhwMHdQN1FOa2VUVWJDQ29IVVln</guid></item><item><title>中国：外科医生进行猪-人肺移植- DW</title><link>https://www.dw.com/en/china-surgeons-conduct-pig-to-human-lung-transplant/a-73764713</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-tracking-name="rich-text" data-tracking-skip="true" class="c17j8gzx rc0m0op r1ebneao s198y7xq rich-text l1evdo4u blt0baw s16w0xvi rcjjkz7 w128axg5 b1fzgn0z"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surgeons in &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/china/t-18480887"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; have conducted a successful pig-to-human lung transplant which they say demonstrated the feasibility of the procedure – even if substantial further tests are still required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to scientists at the National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease in the southern Chinese city of &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/china-several-dead-after-ship-hits-bridge-in-guangzhou/a-68334582"&gt;Guangzhou&lt;/a&gt;, the pig lung, which was transplanted into a brain-dead human recipient, "maintained viability and functionality" for 216 hours (nine days) without becoming infected or being rejected by its host.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-vendor-cmp-id="c44391" data-lang-code="en" data-id="68339716" class="embed dw-widget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is xenotransplantation?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transplantation of organs across species is known as &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/could-pigs-hearts-soon-beat-in-human-bodies/a-46615611"&gt;xenotransplantation&lt;/a&gt; and has been touted as a potential solution to the global organ shortage crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a rel="noopener follow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03861-x" title="External link — Guangzhou study"&gt;Guangzhou study&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, advancements have recently been made in heart and kidney xenotransplantation from pigs to humans, but lungs present "distinct challenges" due to their "anatomical and physiological complexity."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among other things, the direct contact of the lung with the outside air naturally increases the risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the genetically altered lung transplanted from the 22-month-old, 70-kilogram, male, Chinese Bama Xiang pig to the 39-year-old male human patient survived and functioned for over a week of monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This study demonstrates that genetically modified pig lungs can maintain viability and functionality in brain-dead recipients for 216 hours without signs of hyperacute rejection or evidence of uncontrolled infection," concluded the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This success highlights the progress made in genetic modifications and immunosuppressive strategies but also underscores key challenges that must be addressed for clinical translation."&lt;/p&gt;

Another type – Salmonella Dublin – is primarily associated with cattle and can cause more severe illness in people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors see more bloodstream infections, longer hospital stays, and a higher risk of severe outcomes when this &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10803612/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dangerous bacteria&lt;/a&gt; infects people, which it has started doing recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does it get there? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-raw-milk-health-hazard-pasteurization-important/"&gt;Unpasteurized milk&lt;/a&gt; and undercooked beef are common routes, and contact with sick animals can spread it too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not only a farm issue; it is a public health issue because what happens around cattle does not always stay around cattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-humans-cattle-and-salmonella-dublin"&gt;Humans, cattle, and Salmonella Dublin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have wrestled with a practical question: Are the Salmonella Dublin strains in cattle, people, and farm-linked environments in the United States different or basically the same? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer shapes how we prevent infections and how we handle antibiotics. If the strains match closely across settings, the effective approach should connect animal health, human health, and environmental monitoring – an idea many researchers call “&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/one-health/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;One Health&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This catchy phrase isn’t just a slogan. If the same bug moves between species and spaces without changing much, targeting only one part of the supply chain system will not be enough. We need solutions that address the pathogen wherever it travels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-salmonella-dublin"&gt;Studying Salmonella Dublin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers gathered Salmonella Dublin from three places: sick cattle, sick people, and environmental sites tied to farms or processing facilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then they sequenced the bacteria’s DNA to compare how closely the strains were related. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In genetics, scientists track tiny letter-level changes called single nucleotide polymorphisms (&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/genomicresearch/snp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SNPs&lt;/a&gt;), pronounced “snips.” Fewer SNP differences mean the strains likely share a recent common ancestor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal was to see whether strains from cows, people, and the environment clustered into separate groups or stayed together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they stayed together, that would point to active movement between hosts and places, not isolated pockets of disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-we-know-so-far"&gt;What we know so far&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team learned that strains from cattle, humans, and the environment in the U.S. were extremely similar – often differing by only a small number of SNPs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in &lt;em&gt;Applied and Environmental Microbiology&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers reported that despite some genetic differences across 2,150 Salmonella Dublin strains, the bacteria remained highly similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This similarity shows potential for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/reverse-zoonoses-humans-are-getting-their-pets-sick/"&gt;cross-transmission&lt;/a&gt; between cattle, humans, and the environment,” explained team leader and senior author Erika Ganda, an associate professor of food animal microbiomes in the Penn State &lt;a href="https://agsci.psu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;College of Agricultural Sciences&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s important, because it shows that Salmonella Dublin is highly connected across humans, animals and the environment – so efforts to control it need to consider all three,” Ganda continued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study’s findings provide detailed genetic evidence that can help guide surveillance – tracking the bacteria, intervention strategies such as limiting &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/antibiotic-resistance-increasing-enterococci-looming-global-crisis/"&gt;antibiotic use&lt;/a&gt; in livestock and public health policies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-salmonella-dublin-has-a-tight-family-tree"&gt;Salmonella Dublin has a tight family tree&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic picture does not split into distant branches based on where or when strains were found. It looks like a “tight family tree.” That suggests ongoing movement between animals, people, and farm environments or equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of connected pattern matters for hospital readiness, farm policies, and everyday choices at the dinner table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also examined &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/climate-change-increases-threat-antimicrobial-resistance/"&gt;antimicrobial resistance&lt;/a&gt;. They did not stop at asking whether resistance existed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They checked which resistance genes appeared and how those patterns differed among strains from cows, people, and the environment. They found meaningful differences across those sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means control strategies should match the resistance patterns in each place. A one-size-fits-all antibiotic plan is unlikely to work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responsible antibiotic use requires laboratory testing and clear guidelines, not guesswork, to protect drugs that still work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-farms-families-and-food-chains"&gt;Farms, families, and food chains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevention starts before anyone gets sick. On farms, that includes biosecurity to keep new or sick animals from spreading infection, plus cleaning and disinfection that reach tough spots. In the food chain, the basics work: &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/most-americans-dont-know-the-dangers-of-raw-milk-and-bird-flu/"&gt;pasteurize milk&lt;/a&gt; and cook beef thoroughly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For home kitchens, avoid raw milk and use a thermometer. Ground beef should reach 160°F, and whole cuts like steaks should reach 145°F with a rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For clinics and hospitals, rapid laboratory testing helps clinicians avoid antibiotics that will not work. When lab teams can see the resistance profile early, patients get better treatment sooner, and we save the stronger drugs for when they are truly needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-high-resolution-genome-map"&gt;High-resolution genome map&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genome sequencing turns thousands of bacterial samples into a high-resolution “map.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparing SNP differences across many strains, scientists can connect dots that older methods might miss, including hidden links between farm sources and human cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means public health teams can focus on the pathways doing most of the harm. Targeted steps beat broad, blunt strategies, especially when resources and time are limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-salmonella-dublin-and-human-health"&gt;Salmonella Dublin and human health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a fear story or some type of political stunt. It’s a highly-coordinated scientific study driven by peer-reviewed evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Salmonella Dublin population looks tightly knit and changes only a little as it spreads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That clarity helps, because it points to a shared job and a big “to-do” list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials must strengthen surveillance that connects animal, human, and environmental samples; tailor antibiotic guidelines to the resistance patterns seen in each source; and block obvious transmission routes with pasteurization, thorough cooking, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-confirm-first-case-of-rare-parasite-in-pigs-posing-health-risks/"&gt;farm hygiene&lt;/a&gt;, and smart infection control in clinics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put simply, the same pathogen keeps appearing in cows, people, and nearby environments, showing a nearly identical genetic profile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a shared target and coordinated defenses, we stand a better chance of stopping it before it reaches pandemic levels by starting on someone’s dinner plate, ending up in the bloodstream, and spreading from there like wildfire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.00689-25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Applied and Environmental Microbiology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 01:52:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQNEJSSlBKcWcxa3ZHZ0MwR29zVmNQWkw3SnZhRTgtdGtpaC1GRVFOLTR4OUVJMXpDTjRoSGpqSFpPMmtobXNuU2FjR0pLU0ZRTFFKV3ZpeEVvOHE5YTgwNThsSnNHbG91elB4NWNvSUV4cUlMZV9UaUl6THI0QVJYSmk1Rm1paVIxM3kzbC11VmRJejVpcnNfUlNrV2RsaVo3T3B1ZDF3MGpPNnM</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法， 50岁以上的女性应该吃5种抗炎食物- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/anti-inflammatory-foods-for-women-over-50-11794640</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Berries, beans, greens, salmon and nuts can help reduce inflammation and protect health after 50.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These foods provide antioxidants, fiber, protein and minerals to support brain, bone and muscle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthy aging also requires movement, quality sleep, social connection and regular health checkups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once you hit 50, you might be among the women either in the midst of or approaching menopause. This phase of life may bring digestive issues, hot flashes, weaker bones and muscles, and chronic inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It’s also a time where taking care of your brain and body are all the more important so you can age healthily. Fortunately, some nutrition changes can help reduce inflammation and manage other health issues that may arise in midlife. Dietitians recommend eating plenty of berries, beans, leafy greens, nuts and fatty fish to boost your intake of antioxidants, fiber, calcium, healthy fats and protein.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-berries"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Berries &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, raspberries—all are rich in antioxidants that help reduce inflammation and support healthy aging.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “I love recommending these because they’re easy to add on to foods that you might already be eating, like your morning yogurt or your midday snack plate,” says &lt;a href="https://www.loveyourchichos.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Zariel Grullón, RDN, CDN&lt;/a&gt;.re a key part of the MIND diet—an eating pattern designed to help prevent dementia and other forms of cognitive decline. Given that 2 out of 3 Americans experience cognitive decline by age 70, eating foods that support brain health is valuable for healthy aging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Berries are a key part of the MIND diet—an eating pattern designed to help prevent dementia and other forms of cognitive decline.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Given that 2 out of 3 Americans experience cognitive decline by age 70, eating foods that support brain health is valuable for healthy aging.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-beans"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Beans &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans contain compounds called peptides, polyphenols and saponins that have anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Getting a mix of beans makes sure you’re feeling fuller longer and also helps to fight off excess inflammation in the body,” says Grullón.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What’s more, beans are full of fiber to support a healthy gut microbiome, which may help manage menopause-related gut issues.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You’ll get about half of your daily fiber needs in just 1 cup of black beans!&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; They also provide valuable plant protein that can help prevent age-related muscle loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Beans are great because, similar to the berries, we can add them as a side to any meal, whether it’s refried or stewed beans in the morning, or a dense bean salad to supplement your lunches,” says Grullón. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Dark leafy greens like spinach, kale, watercress and bok choy are loaded with beneficial nutrients and phytochemicals that [quash] inflammation and help reduce oxidative stress,” says &lt;a href="https://seemashahrd.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Seema Shah, M.P.H., M.S., RD, IFNCP, WIMI-CP&lt;/a&gt;. This includes vitamins A, C, E and K, as well as powerful polyphenols.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Several dark leafy greens also contain plant chemicals like sulforaphane and indole-3-carbinol, which inhibit several pro-inflammatory pathways in the body,” says Shah. Like most other foods on this list, they’re also a source of fiber, “which helps with immune modulation, blood sugar management and the lowering of inflammatory processes,” says Shah. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; During menopause, drops in estrogen can wreak havoc on bone health, so it’s even more important to eat enough calcium when you’re in this phase of life.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Dark leafy greens are especially rich in bone-building minerals like calcium, magnesium and potassium,” says Shah.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you only think of dark leafy greens as a salad base, consider broadening your horizons. “When you’re tired of making salad, but are still trying to increase greens, consider a plant-based smoothie that balances the fruit with dark leafy greens,” recommends &lt;a href="https://ladybugnutrition.com/#" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jamie Baham, M.S., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Salmon is worth adding to your diet since it’s chock-full of omega-3s—fatty acids well-known for their anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Including one to two servings of fatty fish per week can support heart health, reduce stiffness associated with arthritis and help preserve brain function. For women in this age group, it’s also a great source of high-quality protein and vitamin D—two nutrients that support muscle mass and bone strength,” says &lt;a href="https://www.faynutrition.com/dietitians/elizabeth-oconnor" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Lizzie O’Connor, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are lots of tasty ways to add this inflammation-fighting food to your diet. “One of my favorite ways to incorporate fatty fish into my weekly regimen is making homemade poke bowls with salmon, brown rice, avocado, cucumber and a drizzle of soy sauce. It’s a delicious sushi-in-a-bowl delight that has been a repeat in my home,” says Baham.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-nuts"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Nuts &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A handful of nuts offers a number of antioxidants and heart-healthy nutrients—such as phytosterols, selenium, magnesium, tocopherols, polyphenols, unsaturated fats and fiber. Nuts make for a convenient snack whether you’re at home or on the go. Thanks to their robust nutrition profile, nuts can help lower your risk of cardiovascular disease. Almonds and walnuts appear to be especially helpful for lowering inflammation, while Brazil nuts help reduce oxidative stress.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Particularly if you don’t eat fish, walnuts are worth adding to your diet for their inflammation-fighting omega-3 fatty acids.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay active:&lt;/strong&gt; Physical activity can help prevent chronic disease, falls, pain, muscle loss, osteoporosis and cognitive impairment. For the most benefits, incorporate a mix of cardio, strength training, balancing and stretching into your workout routine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Socialize:&lt;/strong&gt; Loneliness and social isolation can increase your risk of chronic disease and early death. So, make an effort to maintain or develop quality relationships as you age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize your sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Studies show that good-quality sleep is linked with lower rates of disease and disability, and better physical and mental functioning with age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So look at sleep as an essential part of your wellness routine!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get regular health checkups:&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t underestimate the importance of keeping up with your health care visits and vaccinations. It can help prevent illness, catch health issues early and/or manage existing health issues proactively.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As you approach midlife and beyond, making a few dietary changes can help ward off chronic disease and inflammation. Foods like berries, beans, leafy greens, salmon and nuts can be especially beneficial. By adding these foods throughout your day, you’ll boost your intake of antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, fiber and healthy fats. You’ll also get key nutrients for brain, muscle and bone health to support healthy aging. In addition to adding more of these foods, don’t underestimate the power of physical activity, sleep and socialization! These, along with getting regular health checkups, are also central to aging well.&lt;br&gt;

In a groundbreaking study, they found that a daily dose of vitamin D may help preserve DNA and keep people biologically younger by years. The trial, called VITAL, tracked more than 1,000 adults over four years and has just been published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the Harvard study found&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study tested 2,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D3 daily—about three times the recommended amount, but still within the safe upper limit of 4,000 IU. Participants taking the supplement showed significantly less DNA damage compared to those who received a placebo. Researchers measured telomeres—protective caps on chromosomes that shorten with age and are strongly linked to longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“VITAL is the first large-scale and long-term randomized trial to show that vitamin D supplements protect telomeres and preserve telomere length,” said Dr. JoAnn Manson, Chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. She added, “This is of particular interest because VITAL had also shown benefits of vitamin D in reducing inflammation and lowering risks of selected chronic diseases of aging, such as advanced cancer and autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the findings, participants on vitamin D lost far less telomere length than the placebo group, preventing the equivalent of nearly three years of aging. First study author Dr. Haidong Zhu, a molecular geneticist at the Medical College of Georgia, said: “Our findings suggest that targeted vitamin D supplementation may be a promising strategy to counter a biological aging process, although further research is warranted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to use vitamin D safely&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the promising results, experts caution against overuse. Most adults are advised to take 600–800 IU daily, while supplements commonly come in doses of 1,000–2,000 IU. Taking more than 4,000 IU per day can be harmful, leading to a dangerous buildup of calcium in the blood. This condition, called hypercalcemia, can cause nausea, vomiting, constipation, kidney stones, and even organ damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Harvard researchers stress that while vitamin D shows great potential, the trial was relatively short and lacked diversity, as most participants were white.

GEORGE — Two school-aged children in Washington County have tested positive for measles, according to the Southwest Utah Public Health Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The children's schools have been notified of potential exposure — school started on Aug. 11 in Washington County — as have parents of students who attend the schools, a statement from the health department says. All unvaccinated children and adults who believe they have been exposed to the disease are also encouraged to stay home for 21 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents of immunocompromised children are advised to consider keeping those youngsters home for 21 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Southwest Utah health officials said measles symptoms typically start seven to 14 days after exposure, which was on Aug. 21 in this case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include "a high fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes, and a rash that starts on the face before spreading to the rest of the body. While most people recover at home, some people — especially children — can experience complications of breathing problems, pneumonia, brain swelling, seizures, hospitalization, and even death," reads the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents, school employees, children and anyone else exposed to measles are encouraged to call their health care provider before going to be evaluated at a medical facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Residents should make sure that they and their children are caught up on vaccinations as soon as possible," the health department said..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 00:26:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNNlAyTmtONU5xMmFocHg2VXlGUEJ2U3UyVVc0R3NHT012cHllanpfaFlWVnVma3UtT3JfMFYwMDM0RklETHJYQnpDcFI2cDJvMGNHQURVemd1Vk9YZ2JJVFRwa3gxcnJHWnk2NVcwMmRIb210UUxsLWpoZ182Vjk1Y2hhNi1GLVFYUldTZng4Q2pkbklha1VWeDBORmt5Z09XTDhtTklDUzZDdw</guid></item><item><title>强迫症患者的大脑活动中出现了一种独特的模式- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/a-distinct-pattern-emerges-in-the-brain-activity-of-people-with-ocd</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_disorder"&gt;Obsessive–compulsive disorder&lt;/a&gt; (OCD) negatively impacts the lives of millions of people worldwide, but more effective treatments could be on the way after researchers were able to identify specific neural biomarkers associated with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These biomarkers are patterns of brain activity present in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ocd-is-a-serious-illness-and-its-more-common-than-you-think"&gt;people with OCD&lt;/a&gt; when they're acting compulsively, and which don't show up the rest of the time. While it's difficult to know exactly what these firing neurons are doing, their patterns could help understand the condition – and figure out how to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by a team from the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands, the researchers looked at data from electrodes implanted in the brains of 11 people with chronic OCD, seeing how their brain activity changed over time in reaction to compulsive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/us-woman-receives-revolutionary-brain-implant-for-ocd-and-epilepsy"&gt;US Woman Receives Revolutionary Brain Implant For OCD And Epilepsy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the first time, we have found a clear biological marker for OCD in the brain, a marker that we may be able to use in future treatments for OCD," &lt;a href="https://nin.nl/news/neural-biomarkers-discovered-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Tara Arbab of the University of Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patterns were put into four stages: baseline (sitting quietly), &lt;a href="https://www.ocduk.org/ocd/obsessions/"&gt;obsession&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.ocduk.org/ocd/compulsions/"&gt;compulsion&lt;/a&gt;, and relief (post-compulsion). An obsession might be avoiding dirty surfaces, for example, with the compulsion being washing hands; these were tailored for each person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171260" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171260" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/WaveChart.jpg" alt="Brain waves chart" class="wp-image-171260 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/WaveChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/WaveChart-600x359.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171260" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers measured brain waves during different phases. (Arbab et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Mental Health&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain waves of two specific frequencies, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_wave"&gt;alpha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_wave"&gt;delta&lt;/a&gt;, were noticeably prominent during compulsive acts. These electrical signals surged across all brain regions, and were observed for both mental and physical compulsions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In psychiatry, it is almost never possible to link a symptom so directly to brain activity," &lt;a href="https://nin.nl/news/neural-biomarkers-discovered-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Arbab. "This study shows that it is possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were able to measure deep brain activity with very high spatial and temporal precision. That's not possible with an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging"&gt;fMRI&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography"&gt;EEG&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study participants had all received various forms of treatment for their OCD, without success. The implants used as brain monitors here had already been implanted prior to the study so that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_brain_stimulation"&gt;deep brain stimulation&lt;/a&gt; (DBS) could be tried as a therapy approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are so many different parts to OCD that it's difficult to be certain about how it works: scientists have also looked at &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/record-study-connects-hundreds-of-genetic-markers-with-ocd"&gt;genetic influences&lt;/a&gt; and links &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ocds-origins-might-not-lie-in-the-brain-like-we-thought"&gt;to gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt; for clues about how the condition starts and how it persists. The severity of OCD can vary quite significantly from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As OCD treatments go, DBS isn't often used, and is still in an experimental stage. The idea is to control brain signaling to some extent, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5498/wjp.v11.i9.659"&gt;it can work well&lt;/a&gt; – but questions remain about long-term effectiveness and potential side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the new information gathered in this study, the DBS approach could perhaps be made more targeted and effective. Further down the line, it might even be possible to artificially manipulate brain waves &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-brain-signals-associated-with-ocd-for-the-first-time"&gt;during compulsive episodes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's still some way off, but we do now know more about how OCD changes activity in the brain: where these changes happen, and how long they last for. These 'neural signatures' for the disorder are being slowly built up, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-neural-signature-of-ocd-has-been-identified-in-the-human-brain"&gt;piece by piece&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have been doing [DBS] in animal models for years, but in patients, this technology is still new," &lt;a href="https://nin.nl/news/neural-biomarkers-discovered-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Arbab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44220-025-00457-9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Mental Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have trouble pooping in the morning, eating dinner at the right time might help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GI experts say eating dinner three hours before bed may help you go in the morning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It gives your body time for digestion and works with your body’s natural rhythms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For most people, a morning poop can feel like the perfect start to the day. Your body feels lighter, your mind is at ease, and you’re ready to move on without worrying about when nature will call. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you want to set yourself up for that smooth morning bathroom trip, &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; you eat dinner matters almost as much as what’s on your plate. Digestive-health experts say that finishing your last meal about three hours before bedtime can give your digestive system the time it needs to do its job. This early-evening eating window takes advantage of your gut’s natural rhythms, prevents &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-after-5-pm-to-poop-the-next-morning-11774654" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sluggish digestion overnight&lt;/a&gt; and can help you stay regular without relying on more stimulating methods like coffee or laxatives. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, pooping in the morning is not essential. But it does come with some advantages. “Mornings are convenient because your body is naturally primed to eliminate after waking and eating, and it can set a nice one-and-done rhythm before the day gets busy,” says gastroenterologist &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelbassmd/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Michael Bass, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you could use some help getting things going in the morning, here’s how eating dinner three hours before bed can give your gut the kick start it needs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-3-hours-before-bed-is-the-best-time-to-eat-dinner"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why 3 Hours Before Bed Is the Best Time to Eat Dinner &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Gives Your Body Enough Time for Digestion &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your digestive system is most active during the day, and it naturally slows down in the evening.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “If you finish dinner at least two to three hours before bed, you give your body time to digest enough so that, by morning, the colon is ready to move things along,” explains Bass. Wrapping up dinner about three hours before bed allows your gut to focus on processing your meal while you’re awake instead of trying to multitask while you sleep. That digestive break can lead to a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-before-in-the-morning-to-help-you-poop-11718405" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;smoother, more predictable bowel movement&lt;/a&gt; the next morning.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Helps Train Your Gut &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Our guts love routine almost as much as our brains do. Eating around the same time each night helps train your digestive system to follow a regular pattern. “The body thrives on rhythm and patterns more so than isolated events, so focusing on &lt;em&gt;consistent&lt;/em&gt; sleep and wake times, meal patterns, movement and adequate hydration is most important,” points out &lt;a href="https://www.staceycollinsnutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Stacey Collins, M.A., RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Stacey Collins Nutrition, a gastrointestinal-focused registered dietitian.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When your body gets used to receiving food at consistent times, it tends to respond in kind, often with a morning bathroom visit right on schedule.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Syncs with Circadian &amp;amp; Digestive Rhythms &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just like your sleep-wake cycle, digestion runs on an internal 24-hour clock known as your circadian rhythm. “The body is usually primed for a morning bowel movement due to cortisol shifts with the body’s natural circadian rhythm,” says Collins.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By eating earlier in the evening, you’re aligning your mealtime with your body’s natural digestive peak. That sync-up can mean &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-in-the-morning-to-prevent-bloating-throughout-the-day-11782328" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;less bloating at night&lt;/a&gt; and a better shot at a timely trip to the bathroom after breakfast.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-strategies-to-promote-regular-bowel-movements"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Strategies to Promote Regular Bowel Movements &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Timing is essential, but these evening habits can also set you up for success the next morning. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hydrate Well. &lt;/strong&gt;Water helps keep stool soft and easy to pass, and your colon can’t do its job without it.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, don’t skimp on fluids when you eat dinner. Herbal tea, water or even a broth-based soup all count. Just keep in mind that gulping large amounts of liquid right before bed might have you up for reasons other than a morning bathroom trip. And don’t neglect your water first thing in the morning, either. “A big glass of water right after waking can kick-start your gut,” says Bass.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Load Up on Fiber. &lt;/strong&gt;Fiber adds bulk to stool and helps it move through your digestive tract more efficiently. At dinner, aim for a mix of soluble fiber and insoluble fiber. Soluble fiber, found in foods like beans, lentils, oats, nuts, apples, pears, oranges and strawberries, helps soften stool. Insoluble fiber, in whole grains and many veggies, bulks things up to keep them moving along.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take It Easy on Sodium. &lt;/strong&gt;Research has found that people with high sodium intake are more prone to constipation. Conversely, people who eat more low-sodium whole foods like fruits, vegetables and lean protein (especially plant protein and seafood) tend to be more regular.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move a Little After Dinner. &lt;/strong&gt;A brisk walk after your evening meal can gently stimulate digestion and keep things moving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, it’s a great way to wind down without heading straight for the couch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try Magnesium Before Bed. &lt;/strong&gt;“Nighttime magnesium could help stimulate a morning bowel movement,” says Collins. That’s because magnesium pulls water into your gut, lubricating your stool so it’s easier to pass.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Bonus: Some people feel magnesium helps promote sleep. While more studies are needed to confirm this association, a nighttime magnesium supplement could be an added plus if it also helps you poop in the a.m.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skip the Late-Night Snack. &lt;/strong&gt; “Late-night snacks can muddy the waters a bit,” says Bass. “If you’re grazing right up until bedtime, that can blunt the ‘overnight reset’ and make your morning bowel reflex less predictable.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating dinner about three hours before you hit the hay is a smart way to work &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; your body’s natural rhythms to help you poop in the morning. This interval gives your body enough time to digest your dinner, creates a predictable pattern for your digestive system and syncs with your body’s circadian rhythm. Like most health-related habits, consistency is key, says Collins. So, try to stick with this timing as often as possible.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For your best shot at regular morning bowel movements, pair this habit with plenty of water, fiber-rich, low-sodium whole foods, magnesium supplements and an after-dinner stroll. As helpful as these strategies may be, it can be good to know there’s no such thing as the perfect time to go to the bathroom. “Don’t stress if you skip a morning or two,” says Bass. “Regular means what’s normal for your body, not the same time every day.”&lt;br&gt;

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's a drink most people enjoy every day. But consuming it while taking common antibiotics may raise the risk of being sickened by deadly bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from three countries evaluated nearly 100 chemical substances and how they interacted with &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/e-coli/index.html" id="mol-1bf3f850-81b6-11f0-9cfc-a5f058e671f2"&gt;E. coli&lt;/a&gt;, a type of bacteria that can cause &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14772061/safety-warning-popular-healthy-food-deadly-bacteria.html"&gt;diarrhea, cramps and vomiting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that coffee - or, more specifically, caffeine caused E. coli to absorb a lower level of common antibiotics like ciprofloxacin (Cipro), which is prescribed to treat everything from urinary tract to skin and respiratory infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This makes the antibiotics less effective in treating infections caused by E. coli bacteria, known as antibiotic resistance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some cases, antibiotic resistance makes bacterial infections impossible to treat, increasing the risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The effects of caffeine were specific to E. coli, which sickens more than 250,000 Americans every year. Caffeine did not weaken antibiotic treatments for similar bacteria like salmonella.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings come as about two-thirds of Americans report drinking coffee, one of the most prevalent sources of caffeine, every day along with tea and energy drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common source of E. Coli is undercooked ground beef, where bacteria can spread during processing. Leafy greens like romaine and spinach are another major culprit, along with raw milk and other unpasteurized dairy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Caffeine in drinks like coffee may lower the effectiveness of common antibiotics, a new study has suggested (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;E. coli bacteria can cause infections leading to bloody diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea and vomiting.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most people recover within a week, but some people can become severely ill and develop a dangerous kidney condition called hemolytic uremic syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 265,000 Americans are sickened by E. coli every year and over 3,000 are hospitalized. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report about 61 deaths from the bacteria each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, published last month in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003260#sec009"&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/a&gt;, looked at 94 different chemical substances and their effects on E. coli and salmonella. The substances ranged from antibiotics to prescription drugs to everyday chemicals like caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers evaluated the effect on transporter genes, which control what enters and leaves cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found caffeine activates the protein Rob, which stops as much Cipro from entering cells, rendering it less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ana Rita Brochado, study author and biological engineer at the University of Tübingen in Germany, said: 'Caffeine triggers a cascade of events starting with the gene regulator Rob and culminating in the change of several transport proteins in E. coli – which in turn leads to a reduced uptake of antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team noted because the experiments were carried out with cell samples, it's unclear if the same results would be true in human studies. However, they plan to conduct further research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The study found caffeine affected the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (Cipro), which is filled about 4million times a year in the US (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's also unclear how much caffeine exactly would weaken antibiotics like Cipro against E. coli and if there are specific differences between caffeine sources like coffee and tea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers estimate that 4million prescriptions for Cipro are filled every year, making it one of the most common antibiotics in drugs like amoxicillin and doxycycline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'Based on these findings, we foresee a challenging, but unavoidable and important task in mapping key determinants of transport functions across different bacteria.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It then uses machine learning to recognise patterns that would be difficult for humans to detect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Currently, the disease is usually diagnosed using a mix of scans and biopsies, such as an ultrasound scan, a CT scan, a needle biopsy, a laparoscopy or surgery to remove tissue or possibly the ovaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is often detected late because symptoms such as bloating, feeling full quickly after eating or having to pee frequently are not always obvious potential signs of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The blood test looks for what ovarian cancer sheds into the bloodstream, even in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cancer cells release fragments into the blood that carry tiny, fat-like molecules known as lipids, along with certain proteins. This combination of lipids and proteins are like a biological fingerprint for ovarian cancer, according to AOA Dx, which developed the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It also uses an algorithm that has been trained on thousands of patient samples to recognise subtle patterns across these lipids and proteins that signal ovarian cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The test can detect the disease “at early stages and with greater accuracy than current tools”, according to Alex Fisher, the chief operating officer and co-founder of AOA Dx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Abigail McElhinny, the chief science officer at AOA Dx, added: “By using machine learning to combine multiple biomarker types, we’ve developed a diagnostic tool that detects ovarian cancer across the molecular complexity of the disease in sub-types and stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This platform offers a great opportunity to improve the early diagnosis of ovarian cancer, potentially resulting in better patient outcomes and lower costs to the healthcare system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A study, led by the universities of Manchester and Colorado and published in the American Association of Cancer Research journal Cancer Research Communications, tested 832 samples using the AOA Dx platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In samples from the University of Colorado, the test was able to accurately detect ovarian cancer across all stages of the disease 93% of the time, and 91% in the early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In samples from the University of Manchester, the test showed 92% accuracy at all stages and 88% accuracy in early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Emma Crosbie, a professor at the University of Manchester and an honorary consultant in gynaecological oncology at Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, said: “AOA Dx’s platform has the potential to significantly improve patient care and outcomes for women diagnosed with ovarian cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We are eager to continue advancing this important research through additional prospective trials to further validate and expand our understanding of how this could be integrated into existing healthcare systems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 23:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxOa28xVURldzBqTXhVR0Q5Ql80U1JYRjVLaWlKUVhWNUpqS3ZLUHI4NE9xVU1MWElnZnhDbGZoRnBmZ1ozdm9meWVabTBxQ2R0cVZCaEw3aGxBY1FKV2hWeGphWXpwZ0FoMmJrbVVQM1BNMWNPbE1LOGQwRzE0WmYweXpHenZQSFMyM3V4UWxhZFhGRGtMMEpwNm8tZFFnQTZlenVDZ3J0OEtxak5wRTBNVWYyVQ</guid></item><item><title>60年后，科学家发现糖尿病药物二甲双胍背后的隐藏大脑通路- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/after-60-years-scientists-uncover-hidden-brain-pathway-behind-diabetes-drug-metformin/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content cf entry-content content-spacious"&gt;

A new study from Baylor College of Medicine reveals a surprising player: the brain. Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists found that metformin acts in the brain through Rap1 to control blood sugar. This insight could lead to more precise diabetes treatments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metformin has been the standard treatment for type 2 diabetes for more than six decades, yet scientists still do not fully understand how it works. A team from Baylor College of Medicine, working with international collaborators, has now identified an unexpected factor in its effectiveness: the brain. Their findings reveal a brain pathway involved in metformin’s glucose-lowering action, pointing to new strategies for treating diabetes with greater precision.

&lt;p&gt;“It’s been widely accepted that metformin lowers blood glucose primarily by reducing glucose output in the liver. Other studies have found that it acts through the gut,” explained Dr. Makoto Fukuda, associate professor of pediatrics – nutrition at Baylor and the study’s corresponding author. “We looked into the brain as it is widely recognized as a key regulator of whole-body glucose metabolism. We investigated whether and how the brain contributes to the anti-diabetic effects of metformin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers concentrated on a small protein called Rap1, located in a region of the brain known as the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). They discovered that metformin’s ability to lower blood sugar at clinically relevant doses depends on suppressing Rap1 activity in this brain area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Rap1 protein and experimental evidence&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore this further, the Fukuda lab and collaborators studied genetically engineered mice that lacked Rap1 in their ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). These mice were placed on a high-fat diet to simulate type 2 diabetes. When treated with low doses of metformin, their blood sugar levels did not decrease. In contrast, other diabetes drugs, including &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;insulin&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, crucial for regulating blood glucose levels. It helps cells in the body absorb glucose from the bloodstream and convert it into energy or store it for future use. Insulin production and action are essential for maintaining stable blood sugar levels. In people with diabetes, the body either does not produce enough insulin (Type 1 diabetes) or cannot effectively use the insulin it does produce (Type 2 diabetes), leading to elevated levels of glucose in the blood. This can cause various health complications over time, including heart disease, kidney damage, and nerve dysfunction. Insulin therapy, where insulin is administered through injections or an insulin pump, is a common treatment for managing diabetes, particularly Type 1. The discovery of insulin in 1921 by Frederick Banting and Charles Best was a landmark in medical science, transforming diabetes from a fatal disease to a manageable condition.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;insulin&lt;/span&gt; and GLP-1 agonists, remained effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To strengthen the evidence that the brain plays a central role, the researchers administered extremely small amounts of metformin directly into the brains of diabetic mice. This approach produced a marked reduction in blood sugar, even when the doses were thousands of times lower than those typically given orally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Neuronal activation in the hypothalamus&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We also investigated which cells in the VMH were involved in mediating metformin’s effects,” Fukuda said. “We found that SF1 neurons are activated when metformin is introduced into the brain, suggesting they’re directly involved in the drug’s action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using brain slices, the scientists recorded the electrical activity of these neurons. Metformin made most of them more active, but only if Rap1 was present. In mice lacking Rap1 in these neurons, metformin had no effect, showing that Rap1 is essential for metformin to “switch on” these brain cells and lower blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This discovery changes how we think about metformin,” Fukuda said. “It’s not just working in the liver or the gut, it’s also acting in the brain. We found that while the liver and intestines need high concentrations of the drug to respond, the brain reacts to much lower levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although few anti-diabetic drugs act on the brain, this study shows that widely used metformin has been doing so all along. “These findings open the door to developing new diabetes treatments that directly target this pathway in the brain,” Fukuda said. “In addition, metformin is known for other health benefits, such as slowing brain aging. We plan to investigate whether this same brain Rap1 signaling is responsible for other well-documented effects of the drug on the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gut microbes produce D-lactate that worsens metabolism. A trap for it restores healthier blood sugar and liver function.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of Canadian researchers has identified an unexpected way to lower blood sugar and protect the liver: by capturing a little-known fuel produced by gut bacteria before it enters the body and causes harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;, could open the door to new therapies to treat metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Microbial molecule disrupts metabolism&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists from McMaster University, Université Laval, and the University of Ottawa discovered that a molecule generated by gut microbes can cross into the bloodstream, where it drives the liver to overproduce glucose and fat. By designing a method to trap this molecule in the gut before it reaches circulation, they achieved striking improvements in blood sugar regulation and fatty liver disease in obese mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a new twist on a classic metabolic pathway,” says Jonathan Schertzer, senior and corresponding author and professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences at McMaster. “We’ve known for nearly a century that muscles and the liver exchange lactate and glucose — a process called the Cori cycle. What we’ve discovered is a new branch of that cycle, where gut bacteria are also part of the conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1947, Carl Ferdinand Cori and Gerty Theresa Cori were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for showing how muscle-generated lactate fuels the liver to make blood glucose, which then cycles back to power muscle activity. Their work established the foundation for understanding how muscles use one form of lactate (L-lactate) and how the liver uses blood glucose in a tightly coordinated fuel exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian team has now shown that obese mice — and even humans with obesity — carry elevated levels of a different molecule, D-lactate, in their blood. Unlike the well-studied L-lactate produced by muscles, D-lactate largely originates from gut bacteria and was found to raise blood sugar and liver fat more strongly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Blocking D-lactate with a substrate trap&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To stop this, the researchers created a “gut substrate trap” — a safe, biodegradable polymer that binds to D-lactate in the gut and prevents it from being absorbed. Mice fed this trap had lower blood glucose, less &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;insulin&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, crucial for regulating blood glucose levels.

&lt;p&gt;“This is a completely new way to think about treating metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease. Instead of targeting hormones or the liver directly, we’re intercepting a microbial fuel source before it can do harm,” says Schertzer, a member of the Centre for Metabolism, Obesity, and Diabetes Research (MODR) and Farncombe Family Digestive Health Research Institute at McMaster. Schertzer holds a Canada Research Chair in Metabolic Inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

Chan School of Public Health and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. It was published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03891-5" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“One reason we wanted to study the Mediterranean diet is because it is the only dietary pattern that has been causally linked to cognitive benefits in a randomized trial,” study first author &lt;a href="https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/147408" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Yuxi Liu,&lt;/a&gt; a research fellow in the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham health care system, and a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard and Broad, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We wanted to see whether this benefit might be different in people with varying genetic backgrounds, and to examine the role of blood metabolites, the small molecules that reflect how the body processes food and carries out normal functions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The release said Alzheimer’s has “a strong genetic component, with heritability estimated at up to 80%.” One gene in particular is implicated: apolipoprotein E (APOE) has the strongest genetic risk for the more common type of Alzheimer’s that developed later in life and is not directly inherited in a predictable pattern, per the researchers. It has four variants and people inherit one from each of their parents. Those with one copy of the APOE4 gene variant have three to four times greater change of developing Alzheimer’s. The risk is 12-fold for those with two APOE4 copies, compared to those without that variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="The-Mediterranean-diet" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;The Mediterranean diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Mediterranean diet is largely plant-based, with lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, beans and legumes. Extra virgin olive oil is the main fat source. The diet can contain fish, poultry and dairy — especially fish that contain a lot of omega-3 fatty acids. Red meat and sweets are discouraged, as is butter, according to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/16037-mediterranean-diet" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/16037-mediterranean-diet"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. The clinic’s webpage includes a Mediterranean food list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Mediterranean diet is also deemed a healthy choice for those looking to reduce their risk of coronary artery disease or other forms of heart disease. The diet has also been linked to maintaining a healthy body weight, improving the gut biome, lowering risk of certain cancers and other health benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="About-the-study" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;About the study&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The researchers looked at data from 4,215 women in the Nurses’ Health Study, average age 57 at baseline, following their data from 1989 to 2023. They also looked at similar data from 1,490 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, using data from 1993-2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;To figure out dietary patterns, they looked at food frequency questionnaires and blood samples for a broad range of metabolites. They also considered genetic risk. Participants were followed over time to see if they developed dementia and a subset of 1,037 women underwent regular telephone-based cognitive testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The release said that those following a Mediterranean-style diet had lower risk of dementia and also slower cognitive decline. The protective effect was strongest in the high-risk group with two copies of the APOE4 variant, “suggesting that diet may help offset genetic risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The researchers note that people may not know their APOE status or whether they have the APOE4 allele, adding “more work is needed to translate these findings into routine medical practice.” Liu said they hope to explore whether using diet or other interventions to target specific metabolites could create a more focused, personalized approach to reducing dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Among limitations, they note the study conducted in well-educated individuals of European descent, which might impact whether it can be generalized to the public at large. And dementia outcomes were “based on self-reported physician diagnoses and death records, which may introduce misclassification.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 20:43:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxOSnZlRlVjSXhJOGcyRXBQU2Jyc05xQWRYcnYteDRjTGRLVGRLTklRVUFYZXZ3azVrX0JIakRQV0l3cFI3WGVQejBZVlAtb0VLTWFkNUwtcVI3UklBVEJGV0dhOXZiMUZHWElpM1daT2VPQ3FUeHh3RE1icFVGQmszdmJqM3d5OThWS0tVQ1VWQ0NIMG5TNV9Ib013UUtFUmdlRHkw</guid></item><item><title>关于肌酸的知识以及为什么军方为特种部队调节肌酸- Military.com</title><link>https://www.military.com/military-fitness/what-know-about-creatine-and-why-military-regulates-it-special-forces</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
    

    






                            &lt;p&gt;Creatine monohydrate is among the most popular and widely researched dietary supplements globally. Athletes and fitness enthusiasts, among others, use it as they seek to enhance physical performance and muscle growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its reputation is built on decades of scientific research and practical results, making it a common addition to sports nutrition routines and even daily health regimens for older adults.&lt;a href="https://www.military.com/military-fitness/health/creatine-and-military-training"&gt; I have seen mixed results&lt;/a&gt; when athletes undergoing rigorous &lt;a href="https://www.military.com/special-operations"&gt;special operations&lt;/a&gt;-level training take creatine. These athletes typically are still competing in high school or collegiate sports programs but attend a Special Warfare exposure weekend or screening, such as what the &lt;a href="https://www.military.com/base-guide/us-naval-academy"&gt;U.S. Naval Academy&lt;/a&gt; does each semester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="content-adblock-68acf98c4ab3b"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="content-adblock-68acf98c4ab3d"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In military training like Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL training (BUD/S),&lt;a href="https://www.military.com/military-fitness/health/protein-supplementation-do-you-need-it"&gt; all supplements are banned for those enrolled.&lt;/a&gt; This is largely a result of dosing and hydration needs not being fully misunderstood and cases of misuse in the 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read Next&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.military.com/military-fitness/essential-swim-workout-military-special-operations-candidates"&gt;The Essential Swim Workout for Military Special Operations Candidates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw many special ops recruits who were collegiate athletes struggle with severe cramps and digestive issues. This was my first exposure to the supplement, and the performance of users was not impressive. Shortly afterward, the military banned all supplements from special ops selection programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="content-adblock-68acf98c4acb6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="content-adblock-68acf98c4acb8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, creatine has made a comeback with science-backed studies showing benefits over a wide range of ages. While it remains banned from high-intensity military training programs -- and should continue to be, in my opinion -- the benefits of regular training doses have shown remarkable results for high-performing athletes and the aging population, outside of just adding bulk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved short-term memory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enhanced mental and cognitive function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Longer attention spans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science has opened my eyes to the use of creatine for many different reasons, not just larger biceps. Here’s what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Is Creatine Monohydrate?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatine is a naturally occurring compound that can be synthesized in the body. The average adult requires 3 to 5 grams of creatine a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can get creatine from dietary sources such as red meat, poultry and fish. If you are a meat eater, you can naturally increase your daily creatine intake by eating 12 ounces of steak, chicken and certain fish, which contain 2 grams, 1.5 grams and up to 5 grams of creatine, respectively. Herring contains 5 grams of creatine per 12 ounces, and salmon is comparable in calories to steak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, cooking meat to a well-done temperature decreases the amount of creatine consumed. If you’re a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7246861/"&gt;vegetarian&lt;/a&gt;, you may want to supplement that, but your body can still synthesize creatine (1 gram daily) with plant-based protein. Discuss with a nutritionist or health-care provider about the proper dosage, especially if you are an athlete or highly active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many things to consider when deciding to take supplements:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do they agree with your digestive system?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the appropriate dosage?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is it a safe and reputable company that develops and distributes supplements?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Side Effects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects of creatine can include weight gain, nausea or diarrhea, and it is not recommended for people with kidney disease, liver disease or diabetes. Severe cramping may also occur, likely ending an athlete's training day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Recommended Dose&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A daily dose of 3 to 5 grams of creatine monohydrate is effective for most individuals. This can be taken at any time of day, with or without food. Power and strength athletes may take much larger dosages (10 to 20 grams), leading to greater effects on performance and how the body handles it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hydration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drink plenty of water throughout the day to support healthy hydration and reduce the risk of cramping or discomfort. Depending on your creatine dosage, gender and size, you may need to consume 3 to 4 liters per day, which is roughly a gallon of water. If you are sweating profusely, you’ll need more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Third-Party Verification for Supplement Safety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you choose to supplement, purchase any products from independently tested companies from organizations that test for impurities, such as the&lt;a href="https://www.nsf.org/knowledge-library/who-is-nsf-international"&gt; National Sanitation Foundation (NSF)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://usp.jobs/about/"&gt;United States Pharmacopeia (USP)&lt;/a&gt; or the&lt;a href="https://www.consumerlab.com/"&gt; Consumer Lab.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thorne is another option to consider. Thorne is a trusted brand for Olympic athletes because of its NSF-certified products. In 2016, Thorne became the first nutritional supplement company to be endorsed by the U.S. Olympic Committee for supplying U.S. national teams. However, athletes must select from Thorne's specific "Certified for Sport" line, as not all Thorne products are tested to this strict standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Research and Benefits That Deserve Consideration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatine has always been linked to improved&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11828245/"&gt; muscle growth, strength growth and power performance enhancements.&lt;/a&gt; With resistance training, sprinting and explosive movements, creatine can increase the body's capacity to perform these short full-effort activities. These benefits have been observed in trained athletes and recreational exercisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental performance has been linked to creatine supplementation&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39070254/"&gt; by supporting cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;. Studies suggest users can improve short-term memory, mental fatigue and overall cognitive processing, especially in situations where the brain's energy demands are elevated, such as during periods of high stress, sleep deprivation or intense mental tasks. This supplement has been especially helpful with aging populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent discovery has to do with &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-54249-9"&gt;mental and physical performance after poor sleep&lt;/a&gt;. Creatine supplementation may help mitigate some of the negative effects of poor sleep by supporting energy availability in the brain and muscles. While not a substitute for adequate rest, creatine may offer some resilience against the cognitive and physical declines associated with occasional inadequate sleep. For the tactical professional, this holds much promise for shift work and broken sleep periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, though, that the effectiveness of creatine may vary, depending on the intensity of training and the availability of hydration before, during and after training. In some cases, it can even be detrimental.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although you can take creatine as a civilian and in the military before entering military special ops service programs, I still do not recommend it. Many supplements create psychological and physiological needs through their use during strength training and muscle development, and that can be an issue in high-attrition training programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You cannot and should not take it during actual military training programs that require long hours of intense physical activity in less than hospitable environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Want to Learn More About Military Life?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you're thinking of joining the military, looking for fitness and basic training tips, or keeping up with military life and benefits, Military.com has you covered. &lt;a href="https://www.military.com/profile/member-profile-newsletter-settings.html"&gt;Subscribe to Military.com&lt;/a&gt; to have military news, updates and resources delivered directly to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;

Out of 100 marathoners and ultramarathoners between the ages of 35 and 50 who underwent colonoscopies, 42 had polyps, or which 15 were considered advanced pre-cancerous growths. These are bigger numbers than you’d expect, and the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;’s &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/health/running-colon-cancer.html"&gt;recent article&lt;/a&gt; on the research has sparked a wave of concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="publisher_div"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not here to dismiss those concerns. Admittedly, as a runner and running journalist, I hope the current version of the story turns out to be wrong. And it’s easy to poke holes in studies whose results you don’t like: this one doesn’t have a control group, for example, and hasn’t yet been through peer review. But what I really want is to understand whether there are genuine risks that runners need to consider, which is a question that will take further research to answer. For now, here are a few thoughts about the broader context of these findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; The Links Between Fitness and Colon Cancer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been plenty of previous studies on how exercise and aerobic fitness affect the risk of colon cancer. The overall conclusion is that being fitter reduces your risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="in-content-leaderboard-I0-P0-CMI0" class="col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37382952/"&gt;a 2023 Swedish study&lt;/a&gt; of 177,000 men found that those with the highest fitness (as assessed with an exercise test to estimate &lt;a target="_self" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/vo2-max-just-turned-100-heres-what-it-means/"&gt;VO2 max&lt;/a&gt;) were least likely to develop colon cancer over the subsequent decade. Here’s a graph showing their risk as a function of fitness:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_2714071" class="pom-image-wrap photo-aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2714071" src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/colon-1.jpg?width=730" alt="Incidence of colon cancer is less for those with higher VO2 max." srcset="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/colon-1.jpg?width=300 300w, https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/colon-1.jpg?width=768 768w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="pom-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="article__caption"&gt;Incidence of colon cancer is less for those with higher VO2 max.&lt;/span&gt; (Photo: JAMA Network Open)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that the graph gets steadily lower with increasing fitness: there’s no hint that it turns up for the fittest people. The highest value of VO2 max on this graph is 55 ml/min/kg, which &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://vdoto2.com/calculator/"&gt;corresponds very loosely&lt;/a&gt; to a marathon time of a little under three hours. These are seriously fit people, in other words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another study of 643,000 U.S. military veterans, &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(25)00155-7/abstract"&gt;published last month&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Mayo Clinic Proceedings&lt;/i&gt;, found a similar pattern. Those with the highest fitness were less than half as likely as the least fit subjects to develop colon cancer over time. Here’s that data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_2714072" class="pom-image-wrap photo-aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2714072" src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/colon-2.jpg?width=730" alt="Higher fitness reduces colon cancer risk for military veterans." srcset="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/colon-2.jpg?width=300 300w, https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/colon-2.jpg?width=768 768w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="pom-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="article__caption"&gt;Higher fitness reduces colon cancer risk for military veterans.&lt;/span&gt; (Photo: Mayo Clinic Proceedings)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this graph, each line shows the fraction of people who have &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; been diagnosed with colorectal cancer, so the higher lines have fewer cases. The “high-fit” group here has aerobic fitness of 13.6 METs, on average, which corresponds to a VO2 max of about 48 ml/min/kg—once again a fairly impressive level of fitness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a high VO2 max is partly genetic, so it’s also worth looking at the data on exercise habits and colon cancer risk. Once again, the relationship is pretty clear. There’s representative data in &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7048166/"&gt;a 2019 study&lt;/a&gt; that merges data from nine previous studies with a total of 755,000 subjects. Here’s the link between amount of exercise per week and risk of colon cancer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_2714074" class="pom-image-wrap photo-aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2714074" src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/colon-3.jpg?width=730" alt="The more you exercise, the less likely you are to develop colon cancer." srcset="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/colon-3.jpg?width=300 300w, https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/colon-3.jpg?width=768 768w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="pom-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="article__caption"&gt;The more you exercise, the less likely you are to develop colon cancer.&lt;/span&gt; (Photo: Journal of Clinical Oncology)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise is measured in MET-hours, which is basically multiples of your basal metabolic rate. The standard recommendation for exercise is 7.5 to 15 MET-hours per week, which corresponds to 150 to 300 minutes of moderate exercise. The highest group in this study was getting 30 MET-hours per week, or roughly 600 minutes (i.e. ten hours) of moderate exercise per week. Again, this is a pretty active group, with no sign of elevated colon cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="in-content-leaderboard-I1-P0-CMI0" class="col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Defining “Extreme” Exercise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we reconcile these two datasets? There’s tons of data suggesting that relatively high levels of both exercise and aerobic fitness are really good for reducing the risk of colon cancer. But perhaps the new study is testing a different group of people who are doing “extreme” levels of exercise that aren’t captured in these big studies of regular people. The distinction here echoes the debate a decade ago about &lt;a target="_self" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/extreme-exercise-heart-health-study/"&gt;the potential for heart damage from excessive endurance training&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the initial studies claimed that running as little as 20 miles per week could cause problems, but those studies turned out to have serious statistical flaws. Instead, the “extreme” groups sometimes involved people who had done dozens or even hundreds of ultra-endurance events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inclusion criteria for the new colon cancer study were that you had to have completed at least two ultramarathons of 50K or longer, or else at least five official marathons. In the running world, this wouldn’t qualify you as some sort of crazy fanatic, but it’s certainly more than casual running. Is it enough to mess up your colon? The theory seems to be that prolonged exercise can cause blood to be redirected from the colon, starving the cells there of oxygen and causing inflammation and damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="in-content-leaderboard-I2-P0-CMI0" class="col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, it’s simply not possible to say with any confidence whether the new results signal a genuine danger, whether they’re a statistical fluke, or whether there’s another explanation—that the people who volunteered for the colon cancer study tended to be people who had already noticed something strange in their bowel health, for example. The findings should generate a wave of new studies that will help us figure out what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s worth considering what we would do if the results do hold up to scrutiny. There are two points that I think are important to consider. One is that the choice of whether and how much to run is a holistic one: you make it based not just on what it does to your colon, but what it does to your heart and lungs and mind and so on. The overall health risks of running pale in comparison to the risks of &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; exercising. The second point is that, in the meantime, you should take those potential risks seriously. The American Cancer Society &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/acs-recommendations.html"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; regular screening for colon cancer beginning at age 45.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s a whole-killed viral vaccine,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Other whole-virus vaccines use live but weakened versions of viruses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ead25c" class="body-graf"&gt;Campbell said that over many years of vaccine research, scientists have been able to identify the parts of a virus that are likeliest to activate the immune system and train it to fight back against an invading pathogen. Those parts are known as “antigens.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1dc9b2" class="body-graf"&gt;If the immune system is like the body’s bloodhound, tracking down invaders, then many newer vaccine technologies that target specific antigens present the bloodhound with just the pieces of the invader’s clothes that are most helpful to it. A whole-virus vaccine, on the other hand, would instead be like presenting a bloodhound with an invader’s entire wardrobe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e4af3f" class="body-graf"&gt;Campbell said that it may sound better at first glance to use the whole virus rather than key pieces of it but that additional pieces of the virus might not actually do anything to improve the immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-de923a" class="body-graf"&gt;“For example, hepatitis B vaccine is one antigen, the hepatitis B surface antigen, and it is almost 100% protective against hepatitis B. You do not need the whole hepatitis B virus,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-40ae50" class="body-graf"&gt;Offit agreed. “The hepatitis B vaccine has virtually eliminated hepatitis B infections in young children,” he said. “So that’s good enough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-afcf7d" class="body-graf"&gt;Campbell offered Covid-19 vaccines as another example. “There were whole-virus Covid vaccines, but they weren’t used in the United States, they were used elsewhere, and if you look at the general protection from them, it’s not as good,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ddd07d" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/75/8/1442/6567428" target="_blank"&gt;A study from Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, found that people who got a whole-virus Covid vaccine were more than 1.5 times to twice as likely to be infected than those who had been immunized with an mRNA vaccine that targeted only the virus’ spike protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-343ee7" class="body-graf"&gt;“If killed whole-virus vaccines for Covid were thought to be the best technology to move forward with back when the pandemic started, we would have,” Campbell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-275e8b" class="body-graf"&gt;Improperly deploying whole-virus vaccines when they aren’t needed isn’t just unnecessary; in some cases, it can be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-44689b" class="body-graf"&gt;Campbell pointed to the development of the RSV vaccine as a case in point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-66447b" class="body-graf"&gt;“When we used whole-virus killed RSV vaccine many years ago, rather than protect children from RSV, it led to what we call ‘antibody-dependent enhancement,’” he said. “Children had a worse RSV than if they had not been vaccinated, and that was because they had formalin-inactivated whole-virus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-191c09" class="body-graf"&gt;That RSV vaccine trial was in the 1960s, and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rsv-vaccine-kids-rsv-vaccine-babies-toddlers-rcna53956" target="_blank"&gt;it set research back decades&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fddb9e" class="body-graf"&gt;Ever since then, Campbell said, RSV vaccination has either been directed only against the F protein, a piece of the virus, or it has used a monoclonal antibody, which is like a preformed immune response. The first RSV vaccine was &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-approves-rsv-vaccine-rcna82461" target="_blank"&gt;approved in 2023&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ee35f7" class="body-graf"&gt;“Those protect really well,” he said. “We do not want to use whole-virus killed vaccine for RSV. It will hurt people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ce16fa" class="body-graf"&gt;Some whole-virus vaccines are still used. The hepatitis A and rabies vaccines are killed whole-virus vaccines, meaning they include the constituent pieces of the virus that have been inactivated.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Seasonal flu vaccines also use whole-virus technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a2b931" class="body-graf"&gt;Campbell said it’s possible that a whole-virus vaccine could be an optimal choice for some pathogens in the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-3062a6" class="body-heading"&gt;In pursuit of a universal flu vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fb337d" class="body-graf"&gt;But as for whether the whole-virus platform will unlock new innovation in the pursuit of a universal flu vaccine, as &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-nih-announces-generation-gold-standard.html" target="_blank"&gt;suggested by the Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt;, Campbell said that it would be possible to use whole-virus vaccines if they could be genetically engineered to express multiple flu strain antigens but that it doesn’t have much to do with the whole-virus platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bb027f" class="body-graf"&gt;“If it’s just whole-virus, and it’s one strain, that’s what we do now,” Campbell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dabe8c" class="body-graf"&gt;Emily Hilliard, the press secretary for HHS, said in a statement: “Generation Gold Standard marks a critical step in restoring strategic focus and radical transparency to America’s pandemic preparedness.”   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7cf4fb" class="body-graf"&gt;“Developed entirely by government scientists — free from industry influence — the BPL vaccine platform could provide broad, long-lasting protection against all influenza viral pathogens, including influenza and coronaviruses, with the added potential to block transmission and stop outbreaks at the source,” Hilliard said. BPL, or beta-propiolactone, is a chemical that has been used for decades to kill the viruses used in vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b7fe59" class="body-graf"&gt;A universal flu vaccine has been a longtime goal of scientists, as it would ideally offer yearslong protection against the flu. Because of how quickly the virus mutates, yearly flu shots are needed to protect against the most current strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-531f45" class="body-graf"&gt;“There’s a lot of different avenues that people are working, and if we choose only one of those — especially one that’s a very old technology that people have tried so many times before and failed to make a universal flu vaccine — I think it’s putting all our eggs in one basket and not really moving the field along,” Campbell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3b7ea0" class="body-graf"&gt;Offit said withdrawing research funding for mRNA vaccines could be particularly harmful in the event of a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-db97aa" class="body-graf"&gt;“If something bad happens, like there is a bird flu pandemic, for example, we will be less prepared,” he said, adding that mRNA technology has a shorter production cycle than whole-killed virus vaccines, meaning an mRNA vaccine would be available much sooner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8f71e0" class="body-graf"&gt;Rasmussen said, “We’d probably need a year to scale to full national scale manufacturing” using a whole-virus vaccine, adding, “You actually have to grow a ton of virus and then inactivate it and then make sure it’s inactivated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-00f42b" class="body-graf"&gt;With other vaccine technologies, like protein subunit or mRNA, “you basically just make the protein or the mRNA, which can be done synthetically, without requiring any virus or anything to grow it in,” she said. “They’re much easier to change and adapt as needed, as new strains might emerge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d6de49" class="body-graf"&gt;Offit said, “One of the studies among the 22 studies that were eliminated in that $500 million withdrawal was looking at to what extent the mRNA technology would be valuable for bird flu.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-606388" class="body-graf"&gt;Ultimately, Campbell said, science should lead the way, not top-down dicta that tie scientists’ hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d1e89d" class="body-graf"&gt;“The devil is in the details, not just in sweeping statements about what platform is an appropriate platform and which is not,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-923237" class="body-graf"&gt;Multiple platforms are available for vaccine development, which are tested for their respective properties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2b3492" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Eventually, one or two, maybe, rise to look the best, and those are the ones that people continue to pursue,” he said. “That’s what we do in vaccinology, is try to figure out what works and what doesn’t work, both by basic science, by immunology, by models of diseases, before they get into humans, and then actual human studies to compare and contrast immune responses, safety and protection, not just sweeping statements about platform.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC

Those with higher purpose were 28% less likely to develop cognitive impairment, even when accounting for genetic risk and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect was consistent across racial and ethnic groups and modestly delayed the onset of decline by more than a month over eight years.

It also remained significant even after accounting for education, depression and the &lt;em&gt;APOE4&lt;/em&gt; gene, which is a known risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose in life helps the brain stay resilient&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that having a sense of purpose helps the brain stay resilient with age,” said Aliza Wingo, senior author and professor in the UC Davis Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even for people with a genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease, sense of purpose was linked to a later onset and lower likelihood of developing dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were not specifically asked about the activities that gave their life purpose. Previous studies on aging, though, have found a wide rang of activities give older adults a sense of life purpose, sometimes referred to as “&lt;a href="https://www.japan.go.jp/kizuna/2022/03/ikigai_japanese_secret_to_a_joyful_life.html"&gt;ikigai&lt;/a&gt;.” These include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relationships: Caring for family, spending time with grandchildren or supporting a spouse or friend.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;or&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;volunteering: Continuing professional work, mentoring or contributing to community causes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spirituality or faith: Religious beliefs, spiritual practices or involvement in faith-based communities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Personal goals: Pursuing hobbies, learning new skills or setting and achieving personal milestones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Helping others: Acts of kindness, philanthropy, caregiving or advocacy work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose delays onset of cognitive decline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also found that people with higher purpose tended to experience cognitive decline later than those with lower purpose. On average, the delay in onset was very modest — about 1.4 months over an eight-year period, after considering the effects of age, education, depressive symptoms, and genetic risk. However, it is meaningful when compared to current treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While medications like lecanemab and donanemab can modestly delay symptoms of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer’s disease, they come with risks and costs,” said Nicholas C. Howard, first author and public health researcher at UC Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Purpose in life is free, safe and accessible. It’s something people can build through relationships, goals and meaningful activities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods and limitations of study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in the study were part of the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative survey funded by the National Institute on Aging. All had normal cognitive health at the beginning of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used a seven-item survey from the Ryff Measures of Psychological Well-being.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants had six possible responses (from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree”) for statements such as: “I am an active person in carrying out the plans I set for myself” and “I have a sense of direction and purpose in my life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their answers were scored and averaged to obtain a well-being number between 1 and 6, with higher values indicating a strong sense of purpose in life.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their cognitive health was tracked using a telephone-based test every two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted the study has many strengths, including the size of the population studied. However, a key limitation is that although there was an association, the study did not prove higher levels of purpose caused the lowered rates of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Findings support role of psychological well-being&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the findings support the idea that psychological well-being plays a key role in healthy aging, said Thomas Wingo, a co-author of the study and a professor and neurologist at UC Davis Health. Wingo hopes future studies will explore whether purpose-building interventions can help prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s exciting about this study is that people may be able to ‘think’ themselves into better health. Purpose in life is something we can nurture,” he said. “It’s never too early — or too late — to start thinking about what gives your life meaning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurology and dementia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#573b323f3820362533173f32363b233f7922343336213e2479323322" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lisa Howard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://health.ucdavis.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;UC Davis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Lisa Howard – UC Davis&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2025.05.009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Life Purpose Lowers Risk for Cognitive Impairment in a United States Population-Based Cohort&lt;/a&gt;” by Aliza Wingo et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life Purpose Lowers Risk for Cognitive Impairment in a United States Population-Based Cohort&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We investigated whether sense of purpose in life (PiL) is associated with a lower risk for and delayed onset of developing cognitive impairment in a diverse US population-based cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants from the Health and Retirement Study aged 45 or older with normal cognitive performance at baseline and ≥ 2 subsequent objective cognitive assessments were included. Cognitive performance was objectively assessed biennially using the modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (mTICS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive impairment was defined as having two consecutive visits with mTICS scores below a psychometrically validated threshold consistent with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. PiL was assessed at baseline using a seven-item questionnaire. Cox Proportional Hazards was modelled to examine the association between PiL and cognitive impairment. Restricted Mean Survival Times was calculated to estimate delay in onset age for cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of 13,765 participants, 1,820 (13%) developed cognitive impairment during follow-up (median of 8 years and up to 15 years). Those with higher PiL had significantly lower risk for developing cognitive impairment compared to those with lower PiL after adjusting for sex, baseline age, educational attainment, average depressive symptom score, and race/ethnicity (HR = 0.72, 95% CI: [0.63–0.82]).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This association remained significant after adjusting for &lt;em&gt;APOE E4&lt;/em&gt; in addition to the above covariates in a subset with genotyping data. Furthermore, participants with higher PiL had a later onset age for cognitive impairment compared to participants with lower PiL after accounting for these covariates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher PiL was associated with approximately 28% lower risk for developing cognitive impairment and a later onset of cognitive impairment across the studied ethnic/racial groups, even among those with genetic risk for dementia. These findings indicate that fostering a sense of life purpose has the potential to reduce cognitive impairment and dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 19:31:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE9JQTdZVjRKcW9RVUFURlNtUE5KNzQ5Z2l0anV0VC1EUjhhd2dxdEpTRHBrNndHQkt1TmpYSmpuZHFpTEhxbElpUXpiRHcwT3FSTUY5bVBYVEhGeW90ZklFZDVzZjJ6bi1LT0dZ</guid></item><item><title>美国疾控中心任命疫苗怀疑论者领导新冠肺炎委员会-路透社</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-cdc-taps-vaccine-skeptic-lead-covid-committee-2025-08-25/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 19:29:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxNaVhidFNQdERXZ3JaS3FQNXNHMWZnVjFjenl6TW1ZMWJldktFUmZ0NmNUYUlySEoxVWNrSkxUNDhCeUtPRkJIeVRQOUo3SXpEMzhuOGVKN1MxRzZmVkxTb3hJa2k1NjFYQmVEQkhHYi1CWWliMDEzNUJselE3LUd1czRzRGlwUDdaWGZCMl9PTHdMck1pOERTejNZWms4ZUEzTFdreURURHVCMm8wSFBxcWdHQjE2YzZ0YnRUcQ</guid></item><item><title>中国首次尝试对脑死亡者进行猪人肺移植- Live Science</title><link>https://www.livescience.com/health/surgery/first-ever-pig-to-human-lung-transplant-attempted-in-brain-dead-person-in-china</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;

The team confirmed that the patient was brain-dead through four different assessments and gained written informed consent from his family to perform the experiment, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="86327c75-9d0d-4b5c-97b8-d5ec8d350c06"&gt;This is the first time doctors have attempted to transplant a lung from another species into a human — a procedure known as lung xenotransplantation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For our team, this accomplishment is a meaningful beginning," study co-author Dr. Jiang Shi, a doctor in the department of organ transplantation at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/25/first-lung-xenotransplant-gene-edited-pig/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/25/first-lung-xenotransplant-gene-edited-pig/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;told STAT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "Lung xenotransplantation presents unique biological and technical challenges compared to other organs." The aim of the study was to investigate how the human immune system might react to such a transplant, "not to claim clinical readiness today," Shi added. In other words, the technique is not yet ready for prime time in living patients; it's still in preclinical investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once transplanted, the pig lung "maintained viability and functionality" for nine days, even though it showed signs of rejection as early as 24 hours after the procedure. The experiment ended on Day 9 at the request of the patient's family. From the report, it's unclear how much longer the lung might have lasted had it been left in for longer, but the organ had accrued damage by Day 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/can-you-transplant-an-organ-more-than-once" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/can-you-transplant-an-organ-more-than-once"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you transplant an organ more than once?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-jggWJ8SVVdL6WohaZYQr56" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-jggWJ8SVVdL6WohaZYQr56 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nobody would sign up for a nine-day lung transplant," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1184883589/adam-griesemer" target="_blank" data-url="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1184883589/adam-griesemer" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Adam Griesemer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a senior member of the xenotransplantation team for NYU Langone's Transplant Institute who was not involved in the procedure, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/25/health/first-pig-to-human-lung-transplant" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/25/health/first-pig-to-human-lung-transplant" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;told CNN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That said, "I think it is very important to do these studies [in brain-dead people] since you can't assume that the animal models are going to perfectly reflect what happens in human recipients," Griesemer added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiment involved a lung from a pig that had been genetically modified using the gene-editing technology &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/58790-crispr-explained.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/58790-crispr-explained.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CRISPR&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; a company called Clonorgan Biotechnology in Chengdu, China, handled the editing. Three of the pig's genes were disabled so that the proteins for which they code wouldn't activate the human immune system; three human genes were also added in an attempt to make the organ more tolerable to a human body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2024, the transplant team removed the left lung of the pig and transplanted it into the brain-dead patient, who retained his right lung. Immunosuppressive drugs were introduced to the patient's body starting one day before the procedure and were given daily following the operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient's body didn't show signs of "hyperacute rejection," which would have taken place immediately after the transplantation if it did manifest. Although the lung made it over that initial hump, signs of rejection began to emerge around the 24-hour mark, marked by swelling and inflammation. The immune system generated &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/antibodies.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/antibodies.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;antibodies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; against the organ by the third day after the operation, resulting in some damage to the lung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggested that for future attempts at this type of experiment, it might help to block the action of specific immune cells, as well as to suppress certain signaling molecules that ramp up inflammation. The lungs present a huge challenge because, given that they're constantly exposed to air from outside the body, they carry many proteins geared toward immune defense — this paradoxically makes them an easy target for the host immune system to see as "foreign." Additionally, their tissue that exchanges oxygen and carbon dioxide is very delicate, meaning any immune attacks launched against them pack a punch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="026058c0-b4e4-49f3-94c1-a2a666fcd9eb"&gt;Other questions remain about how to improve upon the approach and how well it could work for a living patient. Based on the current study, for instance, it's unclear how well the pig lung could have supported the patient if he was removed from life-support machines, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/20280/richard-pierson" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/20280/richard-pierson" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Richard Pierson&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a thoracic transplant surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who was not involved with the recent procedure, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-pig-to-human-lung-transplant" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-pig-to-human-lung-transplant" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;told Science News&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Future studies can refine the approach to lung xenotransplantation and move closer to clinical translation," the study authors concluded.

The disease stems from the body's difficulty processing fats and sugars and often progresses without causing noticeable symptoms until it reaches a severe, sometimes irreversible, stage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A person in the early stages of disease can have a significant amount of liver fat and some scarring without feeling sick, allowing the disease to progress undetected for years or even decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest research found that as MASLD slowly and silently scars the liver until it can no longer filter toxins from the blood, the heart becomes progressively weaker and prone to failure. Yet only five percent of patients in the study had ever been diagnosed with heart failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Marat Fudim, a researcher at Duke Clinical Research Institute and co-author of the report, said in a statement: ‘The findings highlight a critical gap in the recognition and diagnosis of heart failure in this high-risk group.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Nearly 100 million Americans have a chronic liver disease that results when too much fat builds up and causes scarring (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers specifically selected 570 patients with MASLD that was confirmed by a liver biopsy - ‘the gold standard for diagnosis,’ Dr Fudim said, because it provides the most accurate diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patients had been diagnosed with MASLD between 2007 and 2013 and were followed until they died or until January 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age of the study population was about 50 years. Less than two percent had been diagnosed with heart failure before the liver biopsy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly 40 percent had diabetes, 59 percent had high blood pressure and almost 60 percent had high levels of fat in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seventy-one patients (12.5 percent) died during the study’s follow-up period. Of these, nine were liver-related, three were due to cardiovascular causes, 23 were due to other known causes, and the cause of death could not be ascertained on manual chart review in 36 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over that period, researchers found that 100 patients in the study met the criteria for heart failure despite not having been formally diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of those with stage 4-level liver scarring, indicating the most advanced form of the disease, 33 percent who had not been diagnosed before the study were deemed to have heart failure by the researchers when the study was completed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The biggest risk factors were being older and female, potentially due to decreasing levels of estrogen, which protects against liver dysfunction, as women age. Other conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, also increased the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The graph comes from an unrelated study that projected the number of US adults with MASLD will rise from 86 million (33.7 percent) in 2020 to 122 million (41.4 percent) by 2050&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;The lack of symptoms of MASLD in the early stages leads to patients being diagnosed at a point where damage to the liver may be extensive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also looked for early warning signs of heart failure, such as shortness of breath, swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet, irregular or rapid heartbeat, and dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also considered how many times people had been hospitalized for heart trouble, blood tests showing key markers of heart strain, and scans showing the heart was stiff and had trouble filling with blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They discovered that many more people had clues pointing to heart problems than those who actually developed diagnosable heart failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly half of all the patients showed these early warning signs during the study, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 6.7 million Americans are living with heart failure, and it is the direct cause of approximately 8.5 percent of all deaths from heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Duke gastroenterologist and lead author Dr Kara Wegermann said: ‘Our findings point to the under diagnosis of HF and lack of recognition of diastolic dysfunction in patients with MASLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There is a real opportunity to develop better screening strategies so we can identify these patients earlier or even prevent symptomatic heart failure.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on their findings, the study authors strongly recommend implementing targeted heart screening for MASLD patients who are at the highest risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They specifically suggested that individuals who also have diabetes, high cholesterol, or are female should receive regular and proactive heart check-ups, which would allow doctors to detect heart failure much earlier in these vulnerable groups, leading to timelier intervention and better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

A &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03891-5" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; using data from more than 5,700 people gathered over 34 years found that the participants who stuck to the Mediterranean diet were less likely to wind up with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;em&gt;biggest&lt;/em&gt; benefit cropped up in the people who had the highest genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease—those with two copies of the apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) variant. (For reference, carrying just one of these genes makes you three to four times as likely to develop the disease; sport two of them, and that jumps to a 12-fold risk compared to those with none.) Participants in the double APOE4 camp who followed a baseline Mediterranean diet were 35% less likely to get dementia, and the more closely their diet tracked with the Mediterranean ideal, the more they slashed their risk. (By comparison, people with zero or one APOE4 variant experienced more modest benefits, around 5% risk reduction.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get at why, the researchers dug into the metabolic profiles of people in each genetic risk group. It’s been previously shown that the APOE4 variant can affect how people process or metabolize certain foods, particularly lipids (a.k.a. fats), &lt;a href="https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/147408" target="_blank"&gt;Yuxi Liu, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, first author on the study and a research fellow in the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, tells SELF. For starters, it can trigger &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05439-w" target="_blank"&gt;accumulation of certain lipids&lt;/a&gt; in the brain, sparking the kind of &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/how-to-reduce-inflammation-in-the-body" target="_blank"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; that can cause damage and put you on a slippery slope to dementia. Dr. Liu and her team pinpointed several differences in fat-related and other metabolic outcomes in the double-APOE4 folks that could explain why they were both much more at risk for dementia &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; more responsive to the helpful influence of the Med diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall thinking is that having two APOE4 variants messes with elements of your metabolism, and subscribing to the Mediterranean diet could help resolve that disruption by supplying your body and brain with a surplus of certain nutrients. That’s a huge deal since you can’t control your genes—but you can certainly determine what foods you eat. And while it’s long been thought that there was little you could do to meaningfully stave off cognitive decline if you were stuck with the highest-risk genetic profile for Alzheimer’s, this new research suggests otherwise. Exactly which aspects of the Mediterranean diet are responsible for the bulk of the potential benefits and how they drive those changes could be great subjects for future research, Dr. Liu points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for now, we know that there’s plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/foods-to-prevent-dementia" target="_blank"&gt;brain-related upsides&lt;/a&gt; to generally following the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/nutrition-basics/mediterranean-diet" target="_blank"&gt;Mediterranean approach&lt;/a&gt;, which, again, hinges on eating lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and cutting back on red and processed meats and &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/research-health-impact-alcohol" target="_blank"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;. Previous research has found that older folks who closely followed a version of the Mediterranean diet called the MIND diet (Mediterranean-Dash Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) experienced &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38407506/" target="_blank"&gt;slower aging&lt;/a&gt; and were less likely to develop dementia over the course of 14 years than those who didn’t; and several other &lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-023-02772-3" target="_blank"&gt;large&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2016.00022/full" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2016.00022/full"}' href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2016.00022/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have identified the risk-reducing powers of the Med diet for dementia, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1279770725000880" target="_blank"&gt;particularly in women&lt;/a&gt;, and as it relates to certain &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000207176" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000207176"}' href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000207176" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Alzheimer’s-related features&lt;/a&gt; in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the reason Dr. Liu is so excited about the future of diet-dementia studies: We’re approaching an era of “precision nutrition,” she says, where we might soon be able to prescribe specific dietary interventions tailored to people’s genetic backgrounds, and actively thwart their dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.self.com/newsletter/self-daily" target="_blank"&gt;Get more of SELF’s great service journalism delivered right to your inbox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SELF Magazine</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 17:58:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE9SY2w3QkwzUjVmZVJXdm5tNHFBbXV3UFF4bHlqN1NZY05CcWNoX1NIc1I4MUU0alk4ZlpqUWwyVzJxdkw0aFMwU0IwTS02VEZiYmkxUS1Yc1VJb0NsMGdOSjJlaHRkRmljYWJfRFc5a3dCeUd4NXJVYlpR</guid></item><item><title>口腔到肠道细菌迁移解释了为什么吸烟对发炎的肠道有好处- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-08-mouth-gut-bacteria-migration-good.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers led by Hiroshi Ohno at the RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences (IMS) in Japan have discovered why smoking tobacco helps people suffering from ulcerative colitis, a chronic disease typified by inflammation of the large intestine.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/early/2025/08/06/gutjnl-2025-334922" target="_blank"&gt;Published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Gut&lt;/i&gt;, the study shows that smoking produces metabolites that encourage bacteria from the mouth to grow in the large intestines where they trigger an immune response. These findings imply that protection against ulcerative colitis can be achieved through prebiotics like hydroquinone or probiotic therapy with bacteria like Streptococcus mitis, thus eliminating the need to smoke and all the associated risks for other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory bowel disease comes in two main varieties, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Although both cause chronic abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/weight+loss/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt;, their causes and the exact type and location of the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/inflammation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; differ. Along with these differences is a mystery that has puzzled doctors and scientists for over 40 years; smoking increases the risk of Crohn's disease but somehow protects against ulcerative colitis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As both diseases are related to gut inflammation—which is an immune response—and gut immunity depends in part on the types of bacteria in the gut, Ohno and his team at RIKEN IMS set out to investigate whether the differential effects of smoking on these diseases can be explained by &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gut+bacteria/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The researchers used a combination of human clinical data and experiments with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mice/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt; to reach their conclusions. Among those with ulcerative colitis, they found that smokers had certain bacteria usually found in the mouth, such as Streptococcus, growing in the gut, specifically in the colonic mucosa that cover the inner lining of the intestines. This phenomenon did not occur in ex-smokers. Thus, while these bacteria normally pass all the way through the digestive system as we swallow saliva throughout the day, smoking somehow allows them to settle down in the gut mucosa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next question was why? The researchers also examined gut metabolites—small substances produced in the gut when food is broken down and processed by the body and gut bacteria. They found that levels of several gut metabolites were higher in smokers with ulcerative colitis than in ex-smokers with colitis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mice, the researchers found that one of these metabolites, called hydroquinone, promoted the growth of Streptococcus in the gut mucosa. So, smoking-related metabolites like hydroquinone allow mouth bacteria like Streptococcus to flourish in the mucus layer that covers the inner lining of the intestines. But how do these bacteria help reduce inflammation? And why don't they help in Crohn's disease?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then went back to the oral bacteria that they had discovered was growing in the gut mucosa of smokers with ulcerative colitis, and isolated 10 strains from the saliva of smokers. When they treated mouse models of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis with each of these 10 strains for five days, they found that giving the mice Streptococcus mitis had almost the same effect as smoking. Inflammation was reduced in mice with ulcerative colitis and exacerbated in mice with Crohn's disease.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Analysis showed that S. mitis triggered the emergence of helper Th1 cells, which are an important part of the gut's immune response to invaders. In Crohn's disease, this likely worsens the condition because the original inflammation is actually caused by these same helper Th1 cells. But in colitis, the Th1 cells fight against an initial Th2-immune response, and this ends up reducing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As smoking poses high risks for cancer, heart disease, and many other illnesses, it is not a sustainable treatment for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/ulcerative+colitis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;ulcerative colitis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our results indicate the relocation of bacteria from the mouth to the gut, particularly those of the Streptococcus genus, and the subsequent &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+response/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune response&lt;/a&gt; in the gut, is the mechanism through which smoking helps protect against the disease," says Ohno. "Logically, direct treatment with this kind of bacteria, or indirect treatment with hydroquinone, is thus likely to mimic the beneficial effects of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/smoking/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;smoking&lt;/a&gt; but avoid all the negative effects."&lt;/p&gt;

You use your plastic brush to lather a paste pushed from a plastic tube. When you have a cavity, you go to a dentist who might fill the hole with a plastic composite then sand it flush right there in your mouth. Say you grind your teeth at night. Your dentist might prescribe you a fitted piece of cured acrylic to grind into instead, the surface of which eventually gets visibly rough and worn. Perhaps your teeth are not very straight, so you contemplate getting aligners—thin sheets of thermoplastic that would be heated and then molded to the contours of your mouth and that you would need to wear almost constantly. The retainers you’d wear afterward to keep your newly straight teeth in place might also be plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly every part of modern dentistry and orthodontics involves—and is enhanced by—this remarkably useful material. In some cases, it’s part of necessary medical treatments: A cavity must be filled to prevent worse damage, and at least the plastic-glass composite filling your cavity won’t &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/mercury/mercury-dental-amalgam" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:leach mercury;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;leach mercury&lt;/a&gt;, like the silver fillings that were more common for prior generations. But in cases that are purely aesthetic—tooth straightening can fall into this category—the trade-offs may look different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although many &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/09/avoiding-microplastics-luxury/679939/?utm_source=yahoo-news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hands are wrung;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hands are wrung&lt;/a&gt; over the microplastics that pass from our tea bags and carpets and water bottles into our bodies, when it comes to oral health, we welcome plastic intentionally, and sometimes permanently, directly in our mouths. This troubles Adith Venugopal, an orthodontist and a senior lecturer in the Faculty of Dentistry at the University of Otago, New Zealand; he published a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41415-024-7465-x" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:letter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; in a dental journal last year raising concerns about the micro- and nanoplastics that slough off aligners and retainers. A robust body of research links chemical compounds that leak out of plastic to hormone disruption, developmental abnormalities, and cancer, but the effect of the actual fragments of plastic accumulating in our &lt;a href="https://hscnews.unm.edu/news/hsc-newsroom-post-microplastics-testicular" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tissues;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;tissues&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11100893/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:organs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;organs&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adl2746" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:less clear;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;less clear&lt;/a&gt;. Venugopal started researching microplastics in orthodontics after seeing a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:paper;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;paper &lt;/a&gt;that found patients with micro- and nanoplastics embedded in their artery plaques were more likely to have a heart attack or stroke. Plastic exposure from dentistry or orthodontics, Venugopal thinks, is ethically different than the worries over plastic exposure resulting from consumer choices. “Prescribing it from a medical standpoint, knowing that it would leach out and cause so many millions of particles to be ingested on a yearly basis, is troublesome, isn’t it?” he told me. “I mean, that’s the first thing, to do no harm.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what the harm of dental and orthodontic plastics might be is, as of yet, poorly understood. Venugopal’s letter is one in a growing body of statements and studies coming out of those professions that ask if plastic may be harming patients. (“Microplastics: An Orthodontic Concern!” yelped an &lt;a href="https://www.jwfo.org/article/S2212-4438(24)00037-7/abstract" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:editorial;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the World Federation of Orthodontists&lt;/em&gt; last year.) So far, few if any papers have looked at the issue in humans, though preliminary studies &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ejo/article/47/3/cjaf014/8110795" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:attempt;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;attempt&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969722084601" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:replicate;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;replicate&lt;/a&gt; aspects of mouths in a lab, by simulating wear and tear from liquid and friction. The Nordic Institute of Dental Materials has been &lt;a href="https://www.niom.no/visiting-researcher-at-niom-investigating-microplastics-from-occlusal-device-materials.6716329-606094.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:looking into the release of microplastics from night guards;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;looking into the release of microplastics from night guards&lt;/a&gt;. The chief scientific officer of the American Dental Association’s research arm, Ben Wu, said in a statement that the association is “closely monitoring the scientific literature on microplastics” but that “no clinical evidence currently exists showing a meaningful oral or overall health impact from the particles.” The ADA’s best current advice to patients is to monitor their plastic dental devices for cracks, roughness, or breaks, and look into a replacement. Or, Wu suggested, instead of opting for clear plastic aligners, a person could get metal braces or retainers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Association of Orthodontists is taking a more proactive approach. “This is certainly something that is high in our consciousness,” Steven Siegel, the organization’s president, told me. The association recently convened a panel of researchers to look at all of the available studies to date, and has asked its awards committee to put out a call for proposals for new research in this area. It &lt;a href="https://www2.aaoinfo.org/aao-monitoring-research-regarding-microplastics-and-clear-aligners/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hasn’t taken an official position;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hasn’t taken an official position&lt;/a&gt; on microplastics, because the group, like Venugopal and the ADA, considers the available research to be “preliminary,” he said. But it believes microplastics are “an issue that we need to pay close attention to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clear orthodontic aligners have become a particular focus of early research attention, given the nature of their use. “They’re supposed to be worn about 22 hours a day for optimal tooth movement,” Venugopal told me. People typically change theirs out after one or two weeks and continue that cycle for months to years. A group of Italian researchers &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969722084601" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:published;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; a paper in 2023 that found that aligners did indeed leach microplastics after seven days when exposed to artificial saliva in a lab. But Venugopal points out that the lab study couldn’t capture the onslaught of enzymes, teeth gritting, and temperature variation that a real human mouth inflicts. So he and a doctoral student are now conducting what he believes is the first real-world study of how much microplastic leaches into saliva while an actual person is wearing aligners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is always the alternative that the ADA pointed to: metal braces. Although these may still use a small amount of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10981366/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:plastic adhesive;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;plastic adhesive&lt;/a&gt; to bond the equipment to the front of a wearer’s teeth, at least the plastic isn’t on the chewing surface. (This doesn’t elide concerns entirely; &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/envhealth.3c00051" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one paper;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one paper&lt;/a&gt; has tried to characterize the microplastics sloughed off by orthodontic rubber bands. It may be a lot.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his own practice, instead of prescribing plastic retainers, which can be removed, Venugopal says he’s intentionally prescribing more fixed-wire retainers for people who would get a similar benefit from either. (Some patients would still benefit more from having thermoplastic molded ones, he said. But for those who could go either way, they’re getting metal.) “So, yes, it is affecting me as a clinician as well,” he said. If a patient were to ask him about microplastics, he would tell them what research has shown (that microplastics leak from objects such as aligners) and what it hasn’t (whether the leakage from an aligner or retainer alone poses a significant danger). “Without being informed about that, I don’t want to scare patients,” he said. Each of his patients—like everyone—is already inhaling, drinking, and eating microplastics just by living in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only way to get us out of the dental-plastic loop will be to develop different materials. A plastic-bristled toothbrush may add approximately 30 to 120 microparticles of plastic to your diet with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0269749123021206" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:each brushing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;each brushing&lt;/a&gt;, according to one study. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0026265X2502034X" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Another;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Another&lt;/a&gt; put the estimate at an average of 39 particles a day. Either calculation suggests that a plastic toothbrush adds tens of thousands of particles to one’s yearly load of microplastics, which is significant when considering that &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.9b01517" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:estimates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; of microplastic exposure from food, air, and water put a person’s yearly particle load at more than 100,000. Nonplastic toothbrush options exist, but they’re hardly mainstream. Most dental floss is plastic, too—alternatives, such as silk floss, are mostly a health-food-store find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, not brushing your teeth would be a dental disaster, and no one should choose not to fill a cavity. The downside of an untreated cavity almost certainly far exceeds any hypothetical harm from additional microplastic exposure. “I was at a dental meeting a couple of months back, and I bit down and I fractured two molars, old fillings,” Siegel said. “And I went to my friend who’s an excellent dentist. I didn’t hesitate to have composite restorations with the materials that we use. I put it in that context: I think that the release, if any, of some of the compounds and microplastics is probably relatively minimal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same goes for mouth guards: Siegel said he wasn’t aware of any material that could take the place of my acrylic set prescribed for tooth grinding. “Whether it’s crossing the street or having a medical procedure, one always looks at the risks and benefits,” Siegel told me. “I try and limit microplastic exposure in my own life. I try not to reheat things in plastic containers. I limit processed-food intake, things like that.” But, he said, when it comes to the health of your mouth, you want to ask yourself: Do the benefits of protecting your teeth and jaw outweigh the potential risks of adding to your microplastic dose? “For me personally, if I ground my teeth, I would wear a night guard,” he said. That was a sensible assessment, I thought, even if—for now—we don’t really have the information to base that decision on. Still, I got his point. I’ll pull mine out of storage tonight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/08/modern-dentistry-microplastic/683996/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Article originally published at The Atlantic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Article originally published at &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 16:51:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE13WEx4cWxCZ1RfUDN2eEIwVTM4cVlDdEFQdUNEeHRuRVBqMk5kbHgtXzlUdXV5bEhRQ25JS0dHYWZhRXp5VzlrUEZNQ2NsZjZhOXQtMnEwelFydzYwbjl6MmFYU3hvelBrVDMxTklqZTdtTWw4TTVRMHZGZi0tVU0</guid></item><item><title>食肉细菌在佛罗里达州杀死第5人，感染激增至20例- WPEC</title><link>https://cbs12.com/news/local/flesh-eating-bacteria-kills-5th-person-in-florida-infections-surge-to-20-cases-in-weeks-oysters-seafood-florida-department-of-health-bacteria-seafood-infection-florida-august-25-2025</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (CBS12) — &lt;/span&gt;A surge in infections from the rare and deadly flesh-eating bacteria Vibrio vulnificus has claimed five lives in Florida this year, as cases have soared to 20 in just a matter of weeks, with one now in Martin County, as confirmed by the Florida Department of Health (FDOH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDOH reported that, so far in 2025, there have been twenty reported cases of infections caused by the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just over a month ago, CBS12 News reported that there were &lt;a href="https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/vibrio-infections/vibrio-vulnificus/index.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/vibrio-infections/vibrio-vulnificus/index.html" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;11 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; of the infection with four deaths linked to the bacteria, showing a spike in just one month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most infections begin with the consumption of raw or undercooked shellfish, especially oysters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the CDC noted that open wounds can become infected if exposed to salt or brackish water that contains the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC&lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/132803" target="_blank" title="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/132803" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt; also highlighted&lt;/a&gt; concerns over extreme weather events like coastal floods, hurricanes, and storm surges. Such conditions can push coastal waters inland, increasing the risk of Vibrio infections for people—especially older adults or those with underlying health issues—who may come into contact with contaminated water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;a href="https://cbs12.com/news/local/local-non-profit-aims-to-reduce-cancer-death-rates-with-new-health-programs" target="_blank" title="https://cbs12.com/news/local/local-non-profit-aims-to-reduce-cancer-death-rates-with-new-health-programs" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Local non-profit opening free women's health care clinics for cancer screenings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vibrio vulnificus is typically found in warm, salty waters like the Gulf of Mexico and nearby bays, per officials. The FDOH warns that higher concentrations of this bacterium occur when water temperatures rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDOH said that while infections from Vibrio vulnificus are rare, they can lead to severe health complications.

(CBS12) — &lt;/span&gt;A surge in infections from the rare and deadly flesh-eating bacteria Vibrio vulnificus has claimed five lives in Florida this year, as cases have soared to 20 in just a matter of weeks, with one now in Martin County, as confirmed by the Florida Department of Health (FDOH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDOH reported that, so far in 2025, there have been twenty reported cases of infections caused by the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just over a month ago, CBS12 News reported that there were &lt;a href="https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/vibrio-infections/vibrio-vulnificus/index.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/vibrio-infections/vibrio-vulnificus/index.html" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;11 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; of the infection with four deaths linked to the bacteria, showing a spike in just one month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most infections begin with the consumption of raw or undercooked shellfish, especially oysters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the CDC noted that open wounds can become infected if exposed to salt or brackish water that contains the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC&lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/132803" target="_blank" title="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/132803" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt; also highlighted&lt;/a&gt; concerns over extreme weather events like coastal floods, hurricanes, and storm surges. Such conditions can push coastal waters inland, increasing the risk of Vibrio infections for people—especially older adults or those with underlying health issues—who may come into contact with contaminated water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;a href="https://cbs12.com/news/local/local-non-profit-aims-to-reduce-cancer-death-rates-with-new-health-programs" target="_blank" title="https://cbs12.com/news/local/local-non-profit-aims-to-reduce-cancer-death-rates-with-new-health-programs" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Local non-profit opening free women's health care clinics for cancer screenings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vibrio vulnificus is typically found in warm, salty waters like the Gulf of Mexico and nearby bays, per officials. The FDOH warns that higher concentrations of this bacterium occur when water temperatures rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDOH said that while infections from Vibrio vulnificus are rare, they can lead to severe health complications. Symptoms can include diarrhea, stomach cramping, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills. The infections can be treated with antibiotics, but in serious cases, surgery may be necessary to remove damaged tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapid diagnosis is critical for effective treatment and recovery, and those with strong immune systems are at low risk of developing serious complications, per officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to FDOH, the confirmed deaths in Florida have been reported in these counties:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bay County - two deaths.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Broward County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hillsborough County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;St. Johns County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, confirmed cases have been reported in these counties:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Collier County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dade County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Duval County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Escambia County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flagler&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lee County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manatee County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Martin County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Okaloosa County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;St. Johns County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Santa Rosa County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Walton County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, FDOH reported that Florida had a total of 82 confirmed infections with 19 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vibrio bacteria are responsible for approximately 80,000 illnesses each year in the United States.

I never had any dental work and kept up with my dental hygiene more than most people I knew.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like many on the jabs, Ms Lancaster Colquhoun had experienced side-effects including nausea and indigestion, but noticed no debilitating impact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Doctors think it's because I've lost so much weight in such a short frame of time,' she explains.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 1.5 million patients in the UK are now paying for private Mounjaro prescriptions, as well as a similar drug called Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But increasingly, users are experiencing a surprising and distressing effect of what are known medically as GLP-1 drugs: tooth decay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Receding or sensitive gums, yellowing teeth, bad breath, gum disease and even tooth loss are among the distressing symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Months after starting on the jabs, Hope suddenly noticed her teeth were cracked. In a panic, she arranged an emergency appointment with a dentist who told her at least seven of her teeth would have to immediately be pulled out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mounjaro is a GLP-1 drug. Jab users have told how they have lost teeth and developed cavities and gum inflammation weeks after beginning the medication&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In online forums, jab users have also told how they lost teeth and developed cavities and gum inflammation weeks after beginning the medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to dental experts, who have seen a rise in what they dub 'Ozempic teeth', this is in part the result of acid reflux caused by the injections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The jabs make people feel full by slowing down the rate of digestion, which can lead to food remaining in the stomach for longer periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The longer it sits, the higher the risk of stomach acid &lt;span&gt;refluxing into the mouth - weakening and dissolving the enamel and making teeth more susceptible to decay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are medications including proton pump inhibitors (PPI), like omeprazole, that can be taken to relieve acid reflux, but these should not be taken regularly in the long term. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts have also suggested a lack of saliva, triggered by using the jabs, could be the culprit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Edward Li, principal dentist and co-founder at The a.b.c Smile in London, told the Daily Mail: 'GLP-1 drugs slow the emptying of the stomach, which can increase reflux and nausea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When acid repeatedly washes into the mouth, enamel is softened and gradually worn away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The 42-year-old lost a staggering nine stone for her own wedding day, using the weight loss drug Mounjaro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This can raise the risk of sensitivity and cavities, but on its own is unlikely to cause a tooth to be lost unless there were already significant dental problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A more likely explanation is dry mouth, or xerostomia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These drugs dampen appetite and often reduce the sensation of thirst. Patients commonly drink less water and produce less saliva. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Saliva is vital for protecting teeth: it neutralises acid, carries minerals to repair early enamel damage, and contains immune defences against bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Without it, plaque builds up and gum disease can progress much faster. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Reports of “Ozempic mouth” or “Ozempic teeth” are increasingly being seen in our clinic, reflecting this.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients who lose teeth while taking drugs may also have had 'underlying gum disease, weakened enamel or a genetic predisposition', he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In such cases, the added stress of dry mouth or acid exposure may tip the balance, pushing already compromised teeth past the point of saving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Rapid changes in body weight, whether drug-induced or not, can have side-effects of their own. Nutritional gaps, especially in protein and minerals, may reduce the resilience of both bone and gum tissue. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This does not mean the injections directly cause tooth loss, but that the pace and physiology of weight loss may make pre-existing dental problems worse.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Equally, jab users may be more susceptible to dental issues because they're failing to eat a balanced diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr Rizwan Mahmood, a private dentist at London clinic Ruh Dental, 'eating less can also mean fewer nutrients like calcium and vitamin D - essentials for healthy teeth and gums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We're seeing more inflammation and gum issues in patients using these medications, especially if they're not eating a balanced diet.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also told the Daily Mail: 'GLP-1 patients&lt;span&gt; often opt for softer, more processed foods which, if not counterbalanced with good hygiene, can quickly lead to plaque build-up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While these medications are highly effective, they can inadvertently create conditions that harm oral health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14277797/Ultra-processed-food-blamed-flaw-childrens-development.html"&gt;has also suggested&lt;/a&gt; a diet high in soft and hyper-palatable processed foods may reduce facial muscle strength and trigger teeth issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But regularly chewing solid and fibrous foods exercises the jaw, helping to prevent &lt;span&gt;deficiencies in the size and shape of dental arches.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So devastating is the impact of the crippling dental side-effect that one patient has even filed a lawsuit against Mounjaro manufacturer Eli Lilly and Ozempic manufacturer Novo Nordisk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Attorneys for Jaclyn Bjorklund, from Louisiana, who had used both injections, claimed she was diagnosed with a condition called gastroparesis after using the jabs, which caused her to vomit so much that some of her teeth fell out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Others have taken to social media forums to share their concerns over their rapidly declining dental health while on the jabs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one Reddit thread with more than 149,000 users, a user wrote: 'In the last week I have developed a bad inflammation on my gums. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'On some teeth I feel like the gum is receding or shrinking because I can see and feel the tooth necks which look orange.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another said: 'Since starting my journey, I’ve lost 80 pounds in five months. Has anyone noticed that since starting you are more prone to tooth decay or cavities!? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I’ve always had cavities every so often but I can count at least six right now.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For Ms Lancaster Colquhoun, the debilitating side-effect has seen her shell out more than £3,700 to fix her teeth.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But despite now needing dentures for life, she insists that taking the weight loss jab has saved her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I’d encourage people to consider the jab because of how life-changing it’s been for me,' she said.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Responding to Ms Lancaster Colquhoun's tale, Eli Lilly said: 'Patient safety is Lilly’s top priority, and we take any reports regarding patient safety extremely seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Regulatory agencies conduct extensive independent assessments of the benefits and risks of every new medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Lilly is committed to continually monitoring, evaluating and reporting safety data to ensure the latest information is available for regulators and prescribers.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It is also important to know the tell-tale signs of a brain tumour to help catch in its early stages &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now evidence of a potential increased risk of malignant brain tumours adds urgency to shift the focus from short-term recovery to lifelong vigilance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This underscores the importance of long-term monitoring for anyone with a history of a traumatic brain injury.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, researchers divided 75,000 adults who had suffered a traumatic brain injury into three categories: mild, moderate and severe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mild included concussion, while falls and car crashes came under moderate and severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The other 75,000 study participants had no history of traumatic brain injuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found 87 volunteers in the moderate or severe group developed brain tumours within three to five years of injury—far higher than the mild or control group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sandro Marini, a neurologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and study co-author, added: 'While there is an increased risk of tumor from a traumatic brain injury, the overall risk remains low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Still, brain tumor is a devastating disease and often gets detected in later stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

There is much more work required and we are not on the dawn of an era of lung xenotransplantation using pig lungs,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Xenotransplantation has become a hot area of research in recent years, with the heart, kidneys and liver among the organs that have been transplanted into humans from pigs. The latter are typically genetically modified by removing certain pig genes and inserting specific human genes, to reduce rejection of the organs by the recipient’s body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Studies are often initially carried out on brain dead human recipients before, in some cases, being used in living patients. While there have been only a handful of living recipients, many have &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/nov/01/pig-heart-transplant-faucette-dies" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;died within weeks or months&lt;/a&gt; of such surgery, albeit not necessarily from complications relating to the transplant. However, &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/14/health/xenotransplant-pig-kidney-patient" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;some with transplanted pig kidneys have survived&lt;/a&gt; with the organs still functioning several months after the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But experts say xenotransplantation using lungs is particularly tricky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Every breath you breathe in is bringing the external environment into the body,” said Fisher. This means the lungs need to be very capable of responding to attacks from pollution, infection and other sources. “So the immune system in the lung is very sensitive and very active, which means when you’re dealing with organ transplantation, where you know you don’t want the immune system to be very active, it poses extra challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03861-x" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Writing in the journal Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, researchers in China reported how they transplanted the left lung from a Chinese Bama Xiang donor pig with six genetic modifications into a 39-year-old brain dead male recipient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The team found the lung remained viable and functional over a 216-hour period and did not trigger hyperacute rejection – a rapid, violent immune response by the recipient’s body. There were also no signs of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, 24 hours after transplantation the lung showed signs of fluid accumulation and damage, possibly initially due to transplant-related inflammation. And despite the recipient being given powerful immunosuppressive medication, the transplanted organ was progressively attacked by antibodies, resulting in significant damage over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The impact of the damage was likely underestimated [because] the human recipient still had one of their own lungs present and this would have compensated for the damaged porcine lung,” said Fisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Peter Friend, from the University of Oxford, said the results were complicated by the fact brain death itself causes an acute inflammatory state. “So some of what they are seeing may be a function of the brain dead status of the recipient,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers behind the work said the approach needed to be refined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Continued efforts are needed to optimise immunosuppressive regimens, refine genetic modifications, enhance lung preservation strategies and assess long-term graft function beyond the acute phase,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Friend said other approaches to increasing the availability of organs were being investigated, including remodelling donor organs using stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some research groups are also exploring the possibility of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/sep/07/humanised-kidneys-grown-inside-pigs-for-the-first-time" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;growing humanised organs inside pigs or sheep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Fisher added that while xenotransplantation for lungs held promise, another promising avenue was to treat human donor lungs deemed to be unsuitable for transplantation so they could be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If we get that right, that’s something can be implemented within months, and certainly in years could be making very big differences,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxPdWpUMnJpTmhGblh4ZnhBb0hZNzJwb2wzS05CRDBxOXUxY3Y0ZlRueVMzQ285Q0hmRmx5QUN3R3pmVU5fRFh3bVBDRGsxZ1lpaDJXYkZIQjRVdGhFc0tkWU1tc3BMSGI1V0hiYkM1ZEtfNkJkb0dud3VTQ3ZDazRnTG5VQWxaLU5UUm9xdk5RaDh3R2M4aF9DUi1aTDZiVm54eGR2b19GZHFlOFJweF91ZGRSbC1TdnVVcl9GU2M3eFc</guid></item><item><title>洞穴鱼是如何一次又一次失去眼睛的- Ars Technica</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/how-the-cavefish-lost-its-eyes-again-and-again/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Riddle thinks these carotenoids may be another adaptation to suppress inflammation, which might be important in the wild, as cavefish are likely overeating whenever food arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies by Krishnan, Rohner, and colleagues published in 2020 and 2022 have found other adaptations that seem to help tamp down inflammation. Cavefish cells produce lower levels of certain &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-020-1234-2"&gt;molecules called cytokines that promote inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.74539"&gt;lower levels of reactive oxygen species&lt;/a&gt; — tissue-damaging byproducts of the body’s metabolism that are often elevated in people with obesity or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krishnan is investigating this further, hoping to understand how the well-fed cavefish remain healthy. Rohner, meanwhile, is increasingly interested in how cavefish survive not just overeating, but long periods of starvation, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No waste&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more fundamental level, researchers still hope to figure out why the Mexican tetra evolved into cave forms while any number of other Mexican river fish that also regularly end up in caves did not. (Globally, there are more than 200 cave-adapted fish species, but species that also still have populations on the surface are quite rare.) “Presumably, there is something about the tetras’ genetic makeup that makes it easier for them to adapt,” says Riddle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though cavefish are now well-established lab animals used in research and are easy to purchase for that purpose, preserving them in the wild will be important to safeguard the lessons they still hold for us. “There are hundreds of millions of the surface fish,” says Rohner, but cavefish populations are smaller and more vulnerable to pressures like pollution and people drawing water from caves during droughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Riddle’s students, David Perez Guerra, is now involved in a committee to support cavefish conservation. And researchers themselves are increasingly careful, too. “The tissues of the fish collected during our lab’s last field trip benefited nine different labs,” Riddle says. “We wasted nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;

lowered the risk of dementia by at least 35% in people with two copies of the APOE4 gene, a major risk factor for Alzheimer’s, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We followed over 5,700 people for 34 years and found those who followed a baseline Mediterranean diet with little alcohol, red and processed meat but full of vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, fish and olive oil all reduced the risk of dementia,” said Yuxi Liu, lead author of the Mass General Brigham study published Monday in the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03891-5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:journal Nature;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;journal Nature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But the benefit was highest for people with the APOE4 gene, especially those with two copies of APOE4,” said Liu, a research fellow in medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. “Not only did following a baseline Mediterranean diet reduce the probability of developing dementia by 35% in people with two APOE4 genes, but higher adherence to the diet further reduced their risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another major finding of the study: People with the APOE4 gene appear to have distinctive metabolic profiles that dramatically respond to healthy nutrients in the Mediterranean diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolic processes such as nutrient digestion, energy production, and the building and repairing of nerves and tissues of the body and brain are highly dependent on the quality of vitamins, enzymes, amino acids, carbohydrates and lipids (fats) in a healthy diet, Liu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Improving the metabolic function in people with APOE4 through diet might explain, or at least partially explain, the huge fall in dementia risk we saw in our study,” she said. “Of course, we need future studies to further validate that concept.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a “stop the presses” finding, said neurologist Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida who conducts studies on cognitive improvement in people who are genetically at risk for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hopefully this will change the current dogma that having two copies of the APOE4 is a ‘fait accompli’ for developing Alzheimer’s,” said Isaacson, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Genes do not have to be your destiny,” he added. “If the risk of dementia in a person in the highest risk category can be cut by 35% just by following a specific diet, imagine what can be done when you work on dozens of modifiable risk factors such as exercise, sleep, stress and the like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The Mediterranean diet is plant-based with little red meat or sweets and incorporates daily exercise and socialization. - Monticello/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Healthy behaviors and dementia risk&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first study to find a link between the Mediterranean and other plant-based diets and dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/13/health/mediterranean-diet-dementia-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:large study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;large study&lt;/a&gt; of over 60,000 people in the United Kingdom in 2023 found those who stuck most closely to a Mediterranean diet had up to a 23% lower risk for dementia compared with people who didn’t follow the diet well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another 2023 study that looked at brain tissue &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/08/health/alzheimers-mediterranean-mind-diet-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:echoed these findings;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;echoed these findings&lt;/a&gt;.

Adding just one food category from either diet — such as eating recommended amounts of vegetables or fruits — reduced amyloid buildup in the brain to a level similar to being about four years younger, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIND diet is short for Mediterranean-DASH Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay. This diet sticks to the Mediterranean diet but recommends specific amounts of known brain-healthy foods such as dark leafy greens and berries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s when individuals take lifestyle changes to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/18/health/alzheimers-blood-brain-improvement-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the next level;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the next level&lt;/a&gt; that the most benefit is seen, according to Isaacson. A patient in his clinical trial, Simon Nicholls, reduced his risk of developing Alzheimer’s via lifestyle changes including diet, exercise, reducing stress and optimizing sleep, along with a few strategically chosen supplements and medications. Nicholls, who has two copies of the APOE4 gene, dramatically changed his exercise and eating habits and within a year had reduced the amount of amyloid and tau in his blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more startling: Brain volume scans showed that the hippocampus, the tiny seahorse-shaped organ responsible for memory, had actually grown in volume in Nicholls’ brain since he started the intervention. Nicholls continues to maintain his healthy lifestyle and has continued to improve, Isaacson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Possible future loss of study data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study followed men and women between the ages of 55 and 75 who were part of the &lt;a href="https://nurseshealthstudy.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nurse’s Health Study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nurse’s Health Study&lt;/a&gt;, started in 1976 to investigate women’s nutritional risk factors for chronic disease, and the &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/research/health-professionals/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Health Professionals Follow-Up Study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Health Professionals Follow-Up Study&lt;/a&gt;, which has chronicled the health and diet of men since 1986.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietary data, along with DNA, blood, urine, stool and tissue samples from both studies, have enabled researchers like Liu to make major advances in science — the discovery of the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8094827/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dangers of trans fats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dangers of trans fats&lt;/a&gt; and the subsequent ban from the US food supply; the link between &lt;a href="https://www.bcrf.org/blog/investigating-breast-cancer-dr-walter-willett/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:obesity and breast cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;obesity and breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;, even in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20460303/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:adolescents;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;adolescents&lt;/a&gt;; and the connection between &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3683458/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cigarette smoking and heart disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cigarette smoking and heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, federal funding for both studies &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/08/health/harvard-biodata-trump-cuts-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:has been stopped;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;has been stopped&lt;/a&gt; due to the Trump administration’s ongoing feud with Harvard University.

Doctors and public-health officials involved in the outbreak, most of whom had previously never encountered a measles patient, are now taking stock of what they’ve learned about the virus and the best ways to prevent and control outbreaks of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles, they say, is as contagious as feared, and unvaccinated people are the most vulnerable. But while vaccination remains the best way to prevent measles, Texas public-health officials say they could have adopted a more inclusive approach when engaging with vaccine-hesitant communities about the virus and its risks. More investment is also needed, they say, into building trust between rural communities and health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These insights should be taken to heart as measles cases continue to rise in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, say public-health experts who fear that measles may now be here to stay. More than 1,300 measles cases have been reported nationally this year, the highest number since the disease was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even though the Texas outbreak looks to be under control, we’re still seeing a lot of cases,” says Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health. “The measles situation is not over.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some lessons learned from the Texas measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Measles is as dangerous, contagious, and vaccine-preventable as expected&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What surprised me was how textbook measles is,” says Katherine Wells, the public health director of Lubbock, Texas, where many measles patients were treated during the recent outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells has been in public health for almost 25 years and had never before seen a measles case. But as patients streamed into Lubbock’s hospitals and clinics, a clear clinical pattern—which Wells had learned about in the medical literature—emerged. Unvaccinated people with measles first develop a runny nose and conjunctivitis, then a high fever and rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease also proved to be as contagious as feared. In Lubbock, an unvaccinated child became ill with the virus after sitting in the same waiting room as someone with measles, Wells says. “Seeing those cases on the ground confirmed what was in the books.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/7294477/former-cdc-rfk-wrong-vaccines/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Former CDC Director: RFK Jr. is Dangerously Wrong about Vaccines;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Former CDC Director: RFK Jr. is Dangerously Wrong about Vaccines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About one in five measles cases are severe, says Dr. Leila Myrick, a family medicine and obstetrics physician in Seminole, Texas, who treated more than 20 people with measles this year, most of them children. Several of Myrick’s patients developed pneumonia and required breathing treatments including supplemental oxygen, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost 100 people, mostly children, were hospitalized in Texas because of complications from measles. Most people who have contracted measles in the U.S. this year have been unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the outbreak, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. downplayed the risk of measles, &lt;a href="https://nation.foxnews.com/watch/d5c0ee929861616db083854daa058a56/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:saying in a Fox News interview;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;saying in a Fox News interview&lt;/a&gt; in March that it’s “very, very difficult for measles to kill a healthy person.” The two children in Texas who died from the disease were unvaccinated but had no preexisting conditions, officials have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles is not a little cold. It can cause very high fever that can become very rapidly life-threatening,” said Richard Plemper, a Georgia State University biomedical scientist whose lab is developing an antiviral treatment for the virus family that includes measles. There is currently no approved treatment for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 0.1% of measles cases in developed countries are fatal, Plemper says. “Yes, that’s a small number, but if it’s your child, what comfort is that? Measles is vaccine-preventable. In a country like the U.S., nobody has to die from measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public-health experts say there is still more to learn about the disease’s longer-term effects on patients who have recovered. Measles can cause yearslong “immune amnesia,” in which the body forgets how to fight other infections. In very rare cases, the disease can also cause a deadly type of brain inflammation that strikes several years after the initial infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Better testing and wastewater surveillance can hinder disease spread&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of the Texas outbreak, measles testing was a major hurdle, state public-health officials say. It took up to a week for test results to come back, which stymied efforts to curb the spread of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until about six weeks into the outbreak that testing capabilities improved, and people were able to get test results the next day, says Wells, the Lubbock public-health director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/7290566/wastewater-tracking-measles/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Wastewater surveillance for measles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Wastewater surveillance for measles&lt;/a&gt; could also have been instituted earlier, public-health experts say. Such testing, which was started midway through the Texas outbreak, can flag the presence of a disease even before people come forward with symptoms. Recently in Idaho, &lt;a href="https://mailchi.mp/messages/pandemic-center-tracking-report-12768792" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:wastewater surveillance detected measles activity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;wastewater surveillance detected measles activity&lt;/a&gt; at least a week before the state’s first case in 30 years was reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pushing vaccination is important—but so is meeting people ‘where they are’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texas outbreak started in a Mennonite community in Gaines County where vaccination rates are low. State health officials say they pushed hard to get people in the community vaccinated, setting up mobile vaccine clinics and educating people on the safety and efficacy of the shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, more than 300 people in the county were vaccinated as part of this campaign, says Zach Holbrooks, executive director of the South Plains Public Health District, which includes Gaines County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But officials said they could have done a better job at providing not just vaccines but also information and other resources that could have helped families that chose not to vaccinate and had sick kids at home. Many children showed up to the hospital with dehydration, for instance, and could have benefited from information on the importance of keeping children hydrated, Wells says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/6981222/public-health-measles-history/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Public Health Community Needs to Tell the Whole Truth About the History of Measles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Public Health Community Needs to Tell the Whole Truth About the History of Measles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services said in an email that in future outbreaks, it would continue to share information about the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, but it might also introduce more general messaging that does not focus on vaccines, such as when people with measles symptoms should seek emergency care, sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have to meet people where they are,” says Lori Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, which represents local health departments across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeman says that building trust with communities—and doing so before an emergency strikes—is indispensable. “Our work is only as successful as our ability to partner with communities,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;People do listen to official advice, and the quality of that advice matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texas outbreak demonstrated that the public does heed official recommendations, says Plemper of Georgia State University, and highlights the heavy responsibility that health leaders shoulder when doling out advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://time.com/7263882/measles-vaccine-rfk-jr-vitamin-a/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:repeatedly;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;repeatedly&lt;/a&gt; said that supplementing with vitamin A could effectively treat measles. Vitamin A is not an approved measles treatment, and while some research has shown that people with vitamin A deficiencies can get sicker from the disease, there is no evidence that people who aren’t deficient will benefit from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking too much vitamin A, however, can cause organ damage. Several children in Texas were reportedly hospitalized earlier this year after &lt;a href="https://www.tpr.org/public-health/2025-03-27/west-texas-children-treated-for-vitamin-a-toxicity-as-medical-disinformation-spreads-alongside-measles-outbreak" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:taking too much vitamin A;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;taking too much vitamin A&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuzzo of Brown’s Pandemic Center says Kennedy—who has long questioned the safety of the MMR vaccine and provided misleading information about the outbreak—did little to help curb the outbreak in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have an HHS Secretary who was pushing false narratives about the vaccine and the virus,” she says. “It was controlled despite him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact us&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;a href="mailto:letters@time.com?subject=(READER%20FEEDBACK)%20What%20We%E2%80%99ve%20Learned%20from%20the%20Texas%20Measles%20Outbreak&amp;amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F7311758%2Ftexas-measles-outbreak-lessons%2F" data-ylk="slk:letters@time.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;letters@time.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 14:11:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE1sakFZY1owaEVob2JpUXhBR0dta2ZBaDVuTUNtT0I2a0xIUXV2d0poaDR5Ny1WOXg3RDJ5UXFmNWVMZHhmck1ORzRGeHFWaXcwcXdlMUJfcUlGVk9iakZmWm1rZjRHVHgya2xfbWMybVNwdlRIVGZV</guid></item><item><title>瘟疫再次出现在加利福尼亚州。以下是它有多危险-《洛杉矶时报》</title><link>https://www.latimes.com/california/newsletter/2025-08-25/the-plague-reappeared-in-california</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-element="story-body" class="ct-rich-text-children font-cms-font-brand-text font-normal text-lg leading-7.75 [&amp;amp;_&amp;gt;p]:text-cms-story-body-color-text clearfix mb-10 md:max-w-170 md:mx-auto" data-subscriber-content&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plague, aka the Black Death, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-08-19/california-resident-tests-positive-for-plague-officials-blame-lake-tahoe-flea"&gt;&lt;u&gt;made a reappearance in California last week&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after it infected a South Lake Tahoe resident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt; &lt;ps-newsletter-module class="module newsletter-module" data-id="8" data-module-id="00000197-ccca-dd7b-a3f7-deeae8b10012"&gt; &lt;div class="module-container"&gt; &lt;p class="module-icon"&gt; &lt;svg class="icon flying-envelope-icon"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#icon-flying-envelope"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;span class="visually-hidden"&gt;Newsletter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="module-title"&gt;You're reading the Essential California newsletter&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p class="module-description"&gt;Sign up to start every day with California's most important stories.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="module-disclaimer"&gt; You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/ps-newsletter-module&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person contracted the rare and dangerous disease after being bitten by an infected flea while camping in the South Lake Tahoe area, according to El Dorado County health officials. The patient is recovering at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people associate the term “plague” with the massive and destructive event that killed 25 million Europeans in the Middle Ages, professor John Swartzberg &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-08-22/bubonic-plague-california-case-lake-tahoe-experts-explain"&gt;&lt;u&gt;told my colleague&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Karen Garcia. But it has also made several appearances in California within the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A plague case was reported in El Dorado County in 2020, and two other cases were &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-plague-yosemite-20150819-story.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported in California in 2015&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suspected to have been caused by bites from an infected flea or rodent in Yosemite National Park. All three patients received treatment and made a full recovery, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though medical advancements have made the deadly disease treatable, it hasn’t been eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s more from experts on why the plague is still around and how dangerous it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="how-the-plague-is-contracted" class="subhead"&gt;How the plague is contracted&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plague is caused by the bacterium &lt;i&gt;Yersinia pestis &lt;/i&gt;and primarily affects small animals or rodents in the United States, Swartzberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can spread to humans and pets from the bite of an infected flea or from coming into close contact with or handling an infected rodent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are three types of the plague:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="rte2-style-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bubonic plague, with the trademark swollen lymph nodes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Septicemic plague, when the infection spreads throughout the body.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pneumonic plague, which infects the lungs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 80% of plague cases in the U.S. have been in the bubonic form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The principal source of plague in Los Angeles County is wild rodents in rural areas. Woodland creatures that could carry the disease and should be avoided include chipmunks, wood rats, mice and marmots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people who do contract the plague do so while hiking or camping in these areas and are unknowingly bitten by an infected flea, said Ashok Chopra, professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Texas Medical Branch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="where-the-plague-could-be-contracted-in-socal" class="subhead"&gt;Where the plague could be contracted in SoCal&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials say the plague occurs in foothills, plateaus, mountains and along the coast but is largely absent from the southeastern desert region and the Central Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Areas in Los Angeles County with the highest risk are the rural recreational and wilderness areas of the Angeles National Forest and San Gabriel Mountains, county officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People and their pets can get the plague if they visit or live in areas where wild rodents are naturally infected, according to the Los Angeles County Public Health Department. People who live in close contact with rats also are at greater risk of getting the disease from the possibly infected rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="why-the-plague-has-stuck-around" class="subhead"&gt;Why the plague has stuck around&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there have been several vaccine candidates to ward off the plague, there aren’t any Food and Drug Administration-approved inoculations for the disease, Chopra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease also isn’t a top priority for infectious-disease experts or public health officials because it’s under control. It is still extremely uncommon and infects on average seven people in the U.S. per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plague can be treated with antibiotics, and if we get treatment in a timely manner, there’s little to fear, according to experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if left untreated, it can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="todays-top-stories" class="subhead"&gt;Today’s top stories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt; &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-08-24/supreme-court-reasonable-suspicion-border-agents-latino-arrests" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0fe1f81/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2001+0+0/resize/320x213!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Ff0%2F6a80013543d8a11a4efcb0bcdd34%2F1518336-me-border-patrol-dtla-ces-00364.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f1d8b37/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2001+0+0/resize/568x379!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Ff0%2F6a80013543d8a11a4efcb0bcdd34%2F1518336-me-border-patrol-dtla-ces-00364.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e865df6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2001+0+0/resize/768x512!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Ff0%2F6a80013543d8a11a4efcb0bcdd34%2F1518336-me-border-patrol-dtla-ces-00364.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/14eb28c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2001+0+0/resize/1024x683!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Ff0%2F6a80013543d8a11a4efcb0bcdd34%2F1518336-me-border-patrol-dtla-ces-00364.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/410483a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2001+0+0/resize/1200x800!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Ff0%2F6a80013543d8a11a4efcb0bcdd34%2F1518336-me-border-patrol-dtla-ces-00364.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="People in military uniforms with their faces covered are walking." srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f09d7a0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2001+0+0/resize/320x213!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Ff0%2F6a80013543d8a11a4efcb0bcdd34%2F1518336-me-border-patrol-dtla-ces-00364.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f86bdaa/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2001+0+0/resize/568x379!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Ff0%2F6a80013543d8a11a4efcb0bcdd34%2F1518336-me-border-patrol-dtla-ces-00364.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/19a5892/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2001+0+0/resize/768x512!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Ff0%2F6a80013543d8a11a4efcb0bcdd34%2F1518336-me-border-patrol-dtla-ces-00364.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9604d63/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2001+0+0/resize/1024x683!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Ff0%2F6a80013543d8a11a4efcb0bcdd34%2F1518336-me-border-patrol-dtla-ces-00364.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/651fbce/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2001+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Ff0%2F6a80013543d8a11a4efcb0bcdd34%2F1518336-me-border-patrol-dtla-ces-00364.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/651fbce/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2001+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Ff0%2F6a80013543d8a11a4efcb0bcdd34%2F1518336-me-border-patrol-dtla-ces-00364.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt; &lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;Masked people in Border Patrol uniforms gather in downtown Los Angeles while Gov.

But the industry now says the increase is untenable as it faces a sharp decline in revenue and unfair competition from the growing illicit market.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An industry-sponsored bill moving through the Legislature would eliminate the tax increase — and the resulting loss in revenue would cut millions in funding for subsidized child care.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-else-is-going-on" class="subhead"&gt;What else is going on&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 id="this-mornings-must-reads" class="subhead"&gt;This morning’s must reads&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="other-must-reads" class="subhead"&gt;Other must reads&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2 id="for-your-downtime" class="subhead"&gt;For your downtime&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt; &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/food/list/best-happy-hour-guide-los-angeles-new-and-affordable"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/34f4bd3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/320x240!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F5a%2F0693a3824412a035424d99c2735e%2Fimg-4738.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c8126b7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/568x426!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F5a%2F0693a3824412a035424d99c2735e%2Fimg-4738.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/299b774/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/768x576!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F5a%2F0693a3824412a035424d99c2735e%2Fimg-4738.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9a36457/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/1024x768!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F5a%2F0693a3824412a035424d99c2735e%2Fimg-4738.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6916fcd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/1200x900!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F5a%2F0693a3824412a035424d99c2735e%2Fimg-4738.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="Two cocktails." srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7514fa1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/320x240!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F5a%2F0693a3824412a035424d99c2735e%2Fimg-4738.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1f9f34d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/568x426!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F5a%2F0693a3824412a035424d99c2735e%2Fimg-4738.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8fff31c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/768x576!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F5a%2F0693a3824412a035424d99c2735e%2Fimg-4738.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1666a55/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/1024x768!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F5a%2F0693a3824412a035424d99c2735e%2Fimg-4738.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6383767/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/1200x900!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F5a%2F0693a3824412a035424d99c2735e%2Fimg-4738.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6383767/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/1200x900!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F5a%2F0693a3824412a035424d99c2735e%2Fimg-4738.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt; &lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;A dirty martini and a Hippies in Paris cocktail are offered on the Apero Hour menu at CouCou in West Hollywood. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Jenn Harris / Los Angeles Times )&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="going-out" class="subhead"&gt;Going out&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 id="staying-in" class="subhead"&gt;Staying in&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-question-for-you-what-are-your-favorite-places-to-eat-and-drink-in-the-san-fernando-valley" class="subhead"&gt;A question for you: What are your favorite places to eat and drink in the San Fernando Valley?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shannon Yates&lt;/b&gt; writes, “My favorite place to eat in the Valley is the Country Deli in Chatsworth.

    &lt;p&gt;Seattle-area hospitals and emergency departments are again facing a summer surge of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In King County, recent rates of ER visits, positive tests, hospitalizations and some wastewater data all point to the same conclusion, one that reminds us this respiratory virus still behaves differently from many other seasonal pathogens, said Dr. Eric Chow, chief of communicable disease epidemiology and immunization for Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While common respiratory viruses like influenza or RSV generally circulate more widely during winter, COVID has continued to hit many parts of the country during the summer. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recent forecasting model, &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/why-covid-is-spreading-again-this-summer/" class="content-link"&gt;infections are rising in most states&lt;/a&gt;, though this wave has so far proved milder than those in prior years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is not a surprise to us,” Chow said. “We’ve been seeing increases of COVID-19 around this time for the past several years. But I think it can catch people off guard.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In King County, increases in emergency visits have been most dramatic among children under 4, Chow said. Children can still experience severe symptoms from COVID, especially kids who aren’t old enough to be vaccinated, underscoring the importance of parents getting vaccinated, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years after the country declared a national public health emergency, scientists are still not entirely sure what’s behind the summer spikes. Some health experts &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/why-covid-is-spreading-again-this-summer/" class="content-link"&gt;hypothesize&lt;/a&gt; summer travel and crowds contribute to the spread, or that immunity to the virus — either from vaccination or illness the prior winter — can fade by July and August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State health epidemiologist Dr. Scott Lindquist isn’t fully convinced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s the million-dollar question,” Lindquist said. “I would have thought we’d have an answer, or at least see COVID become a seasonal respiratory virus, but we are just not seeing that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while COVID persists in causing deaths and severe illness, we’re no longer seeing the huge peaks and valleys from early in the pandemic, Lindquist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not Earth-shattering, like it used to be,” he said. “What we’re talking about are very mild increases. I don’t want to dismiss that, because people still die of COVID. But it’s just not the same place we were.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Washington, about 1.4% of hospital emergency visits in early August were due to COVID, according to the &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/data-and-statistical-reports/diseases-and-chronic-conditions/communicable-disease-surveillance-data/respiratory-illness-data-dashboard" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;state Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;. That’s up from about 0.5% in June, but lower than ER rates this time last year and the year before, which were above 2%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older adults are still hospitalized and seek emergency care for COVID at higher rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 1.8% of King County emergency visits — or about 290 visits — were due to COVID the week of Aug. 10 according to &lt;a href="https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dph/health-safety/disease-illness/respiratory-virus-data" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between October, when the state starts tracking respiratory disease season, and early August, about 475 people in Washington died from COVID, according to DOH. During the 2023-2024 season, almost 1,100 residents had died by this point in the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is promising,” Chow said. “It’s a reminder why immunity is so important. Thanks to a highly effective and safe vaccine, and also the fact that some people have had previous infection, this is probably why severe disease burden has decreased over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, he said, “there is a portion of our population where COVID-19 health threats are still very real,” including among immunocompromised people and children too young to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There hasn’t been evidence that any one SARS-CoV-2 variant is fueling these increases in cases and hospitalizations in Washington state, Lindquist said. Multiple strains are competing with each other nationwide and here, including the newer NB.1.8.1, LP.8.1 and XFG, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as there are people who are vulnerable to getting infections, the virus will continue to evolve and breed new variants, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s also harder to know which variants are responsible for the most cases now, since not every sample is sent off to labs to be tested and sequenced, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, state and local health experts hope the late-summer surge will remind people to take more precautions against COVID, especially as indoor gatherings become more popular and students return to school. That includes masking in crowds, staying home when sick, increasing indoor air ventilation and getting vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are lessons we’ve already learned,” Lindquist said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bumps in cases and hospitalizations emerge as the country awaits clarity from the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC on which COVID vaccines will be available, and to which age groups, this fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shots approved for the 2024-2025 year — this past year — still provide good protection from serious illness and death from COVID, Chow said. But updated versions of the vaccine for the coming fall have yet to be approved by the FDA for certain age groups, which is weighing on the minds of many parents, including Chow, who has a 4-month-old daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can’t give her a vaccine right now because she’s too young, but by the time she is eligible, will she even have a vaccine that’s available for her?” he said. “It’s certainly a big question on my mind.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;At 60, you still feel mostly invincible. Sure, recovery takes longer after that weekend tennis match, and you've started holding restaurant menus at arm's length. But 80? That's another planet, barely visible from where you stand. Here's what geriatricians know that you don't: the choices you make right now—not next year, not after retirement—are writing the script for whether you'll be traveling at 80 or trapped at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research is both terrifying and liberating. While genetics loads the gun, your choices pull the trigger. The &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8821855/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;major determinants of healthy aging&lt;/a&gt; aren't in your DNA but in three specific decisions that create a cascade effect over twenty years. These aren't expensive biohacks or exotic treatments. They're available to almost everyone. Yet most people ignore them, believing decline is as inevitable as taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research tracking why some 80-year-olds seem like they're 60 while others at 60 already seem 80 reveals the answer isn't in medicine cabinets or DNA tests. It's in three fundamental choices that, when made at 60, compound over two decades into either independence or dependence, vitality or frailty, engagement or isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Start lifting heavy things—your future mobility depends on it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without intervention, you'll lose &lt;a href="https://utswmed.org/medblog/age-related-sarcopenia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;30% of your muscle mass between 60 and 80&lt;/a&gt;. Let that sink in. Nearly a third of your physical strength, gone. This isn't about vanity or beach bodies. This is about whether you can get off the floor after playing with grandchildren, carry your own luggage, or recover from a fall without breaking a hip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1990, Dr. Maria Fiatarone Singh's groundbreaking research took nursing home residents aged 86-96 and put them through eight weeks of high-intensity resistance training. The results stunned the medical community: &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2342214/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;strength gains averaged 174%, with 9% muscle growth&lt;/a&gt;—essentially reversing a decade of decline. These were people in nursing homes, not athletes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's what researchers emphasize: starting at 80 is like learning calculus when you can't do algebra. At 60, your body still eagerly responds to training. Your nervous system adapts, your hormones cooperate, your joints forgive. Wait until 80, and you're not just weak—you're metabolically broken, balance-impaired, and terrified of movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/how-can-strength-training-build-healthier-bodies-we-age" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that strength training at 60 changes your entire biological trajectory. Muscle isn't just for movement—it's your metabolic furnace, your glucose sink, your armor against falls. The people thriving at 80 aren't just the yoga devotees or marathon runners (though those help). They're the ones who learned to love the weight room at 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prescription isn't complicated: twice weekly, 8-10 exercises, progressing from moderate to challenging effort. We're not talking about becoming Arnold. We're talking about becoming someone who never needs help getting out of a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Protect your social connections like your life depends on it—because it does&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25910392/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Social isolation kills as reliably as smoking&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. Julianne Holt-Lunstad's meta-analysis of 148 studies covering 300,000 people found that loneliness and social isolation increase mortality risk by 26-32%. At 60, you're still socially rich: work relationships, family obligations, community ties. By 80, without deliberate cultivation, your world can shrink to medical appointments and whoever delivers groceries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Academies report found &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25663/social-isolation-and-loneliness-in-older-adults-opportunities-for-the" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one-quarter of adults over 65&lt;/a&gt; are socially isolated. But isolation doesn't suddenly appear at 65—it's cultivated through a thousand small retreats starting at 60. Retirement removes daily colleagues. Friends move to Florida. Energy for maintaining relationships wanes. The infrastructure of automatic social contact crumbles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with robust social connections showed 50% &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;increased survival odds&lt;/a&gt;. This isn't just about emergency contacts. Loneliness triggers inflammation, suppresses immune function, accelerates cognitive decline. Your body literally breaks down faster when socially disconnected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 60, you face a choice: coast on existing relationships or actively build new ones. This means uncomfortable things like joining groups where you know nobody, learning technology to maintain distant friendships, becoming the one who initiates rather than waits. Research on "social convoys" shows you need 3-5 deep relationships to thrive. These don't spontaneously generate at 80—they're cultivated now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cruel timeline: when you most need connections (80+), they're hardest to form. Mobility issues, hearing loss, shrinking peer pool—everything conspires against new relationships. Your social wealth at 80 depends on what you bank at 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Challenge your brain with genuinely difficult new learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crossword puzzles don't count. Neither does Sudoku number 10,000. The cognitive challenge that builds &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-020-0588-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cognitive reserve&lt;/a&gt;—your brain's ability to withstand age-related damage—requires genuine struggle. Think less "brain training" and more "brain boot camp."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4154531/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Denise Park at UT Dallas proved this definitively&lt;/a&gt;. Older adults learned quilting or digital photography—genuinely complex new skills requiring sustained effort over 14 weeks. Their memory improved significantly. The control group doing familiar activities? No change. The photography group showed the strongest gains, likely because they had to master technical information rapidly. The magic isn't in the activity; it's in the struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 60, your brain retains remarkable plasticity. You can still form new neural pathways, still master complex skills. The &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1504327" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Framingham Heart Study&lt;/a&gt; has tracked cognitive function for decades: those who embraced cognitive challenges maintained superior function decades later, independent of education or baseline intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice is stark: embrace cognitive discomfort or retreat to the familiar. Learn Python programming, study Mandarin, master the cello—something that makes you feel stupid regularly. The people sharp at 80 aren't the smartest; they're the ones who never stopped feeling dumb. They chose, at 60, to be beginners repeatedly, forcing their brains to build new highways rather than deepen existing ruts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The compounding effect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three choices create what researchers call an "upward spiral of healthy aging." Strength training provides energy and confidence for social activities. Social connections offer accountability for both physical and cognitive challenges. Mental stimulation keeps you interesting enough that people want to connect. Each reinforces the others, compounding into either vitality or decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tragedy is how many 60-year-olds think they have time. They'll start weights "after the holidays." They'll make friends "in retirement." They'll learn guitar "when things settle." But the research is brutally clear: the window for setting your trajectory is now. Not next year. Now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news? If you're reading this at 60, you're at the perfect pivot point. At 70, change is harder but possible. At 80, you're mostly managing what you built—or didn't build—earlier. But at 60, you can still fundamentally alter your path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question isn't whether you'll age—that contract is non-negotiable. The question is whether you'll be someone who ages with power, connection, and mental sharpness, or someone who ages into weakness, isolation, and fog. The research says the choice is yours. The doctors say these three decisions determine your outcome. The only thing left is to decide: which 80-year-old do you want to be?&lt;/p&gt;

Yet daily personal care routines can expose people to invisible risks within their own homes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hair sprays, serums, and heat styling tools release &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scented-products-release-indoor-air-pollutants/"&gt;particles&lt;/a&gt; so tiny they can slip deep into the lungs. New research reveals just how significant these exposures may be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-billions-of-tiny-particles"&gt;Billions of tiny particles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.purdue.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Purdue University&lt;/a&gt; team led by Nusrat Jung and Ph.D. student Jianghui Liu found that a 10-20 minute hair styling routine can produce more than 10 billion &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plastic-dust-is-making-indoor-air-more-polluted-than-outside/"&gt;airborne nanoparticles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These particles are smaller than 100 nanometers and can penetrate deeply into the lungs, triggering respiratory stress, inflammation, and even cognitive effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is really quite concerning,” Jung said. “The number of nanoparticles inhaled from using typical, store-bought hair-care products was far greater than we ever anticipated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heat-drives-the-release"&gt;Heat drives the release&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study shows that heating tools like straighteners or curlers are the primary drivers of nanoparticle release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At temperatures above 300 degrees Fahrenheit, volatile and low-volatility chemicals rapidly evaporate, nucleate, and condense into dense clouds of particles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 360 degrees and higher, sub-100 nanometer particles made up more than 95 percent of the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cutting-super-pollutants-could-quickly-cool-the-planet/"&gt;emissions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Atmospheric nanoparticle formation was especially responsive to these heat applications,” Liu explained. “Heat is the main driver – cyclic siloxanes and other low-volatility ingredients volatilize, nucleate and grow into new nanoparticles, most of them smaller than 100 nanometers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-harmful-hair-styling-chemicals"&gt;Harmful hair styling chemicals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the chemicals, D5 siloxane stands out. This ingredient is widespread in hair products because of its smooth texture and thermal stability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet it is very persistent in the environment and bioaccumulates in living organisms. Animal studies link D5 siloxane to respiratory, liver, and nervous system damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we first studied the emissions from hair care products during heat surges, we focused on the volatile chemicals that were released, and what we found was already quite concerning,” Jung said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But when we took an even closer look with aerosol instrumentation typically used to measure tailpipe exhaust, we discovered that these chemicals were generating bursts of anywhere from 10,000 to 100,000 nanoparticles per cubic centimeter.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-than-one-pathway"&gt;More than one pathway&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Purdue study revealed that two mechanisms fuel nanoparticle creation. The first is volatilization of siloxanes and similar ingredients during heating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second involves atmospheric chemistry: fragrance additives and terpenes can react with indoor ozone, producing secondary organic aerosols. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when no heat was applied, some nanoparticle formation still occurred through these chemical reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-breathing-zone-risks"&gt;Breathing zone risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hair styling often happens close to the face, placing &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/millions-of-people-die-from-air-pollution-each-year-yet-theres-still-a-lack-of-monitoring/"&gt;emissions&lt;/a&gt; directly in the breathing zone. Modeling shows that nanoparticles deposit most efficiently in the pulmonary region, the deepest part of the lungs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary deposition rates for sub-100 nanometer particles are especially high, raising concern over repeated exposures from daily routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that temperature mattered more than product type. At 410 °F, more than 46 billion nanoparticles deposited in the respiratory system, compared to less than one billion at 300 °F. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long hair also led to higher doses, since longer styling times produced more emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, appliances behaved differently. Straighteners and curlers emitted the most ultrafine particles, while wavers generated fewer but larger particles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, larger particles can carry greater mass, meaning risk cannot be judged by particle counts alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-safer-hair-styling-practices"&gt;Safer hair styling practices&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For context, 20 minutes of hair straightening at high heat can equal the nanoparticle dose of 20-200 minutes of sitting in vehicle traffic or 30-100 minutes of exposure to urban outdoor air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In poorly ventilated homes, these exposures can become even higher as particles linger longer in indoor air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jung and Liu recommend limiting the combined use of hair products and heat tools. If use cannot be avoided, ventilation becomes essential. Exhaust fans, open windows, or air purifiers can help reduce particle buildup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you must use hair care products, limit their use and ensure the space is well ventilated,” Liu said. “Even without heating appliances, better ventilation can reduce exposure to volatile chemicals, such as D5 siloxane, in these products.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-research-directions"&gt;Future research directions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies aim to measure even smaller particles down to one nanometer and identify their chemical makeup.

Some brands can have up to 160mg of caffeine, almost triple that of an instant coffee, nearly 10-times the level of taurine, an amino acid commonly found in meat, fish and eggs, as a salmon fillet and the same amount of sugar as a full fat Coke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has previously suggested people who drink at least one sugary drink a day are at higher risk of suffering male pattern hair loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study by Chinese researchers in 2023 found that younger men who consumed sweet drinks seven times a week had more than triple the chance of having hair loss than men who didn't consume them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the fresh research, scientists found that across the studies analysed sugary drinks impacted hair density, growth, thickness, shine, and hair loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one study in particular, &lt;span&gt;those drinking more than 3500ml per week—roughly 11 cans—were more likely to suffer the condition, particularly men, researchers found. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Studies have previously suggested this may be because high caffeine content in these drinks can increase cortisol levels, the stress hormone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Excess sugar is also linked to poor circulation and inflammation which can both weaken hair follicles and increase hair loss. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the scientists also discovered that vitamin D&lt;span&gt; lowered risk of both androgenetic alopecia—the genetic type—and alopecia areata—sudden hair loss, when the immune system attacks hair follicles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One trial reviewed also found a lack of protein was linked to hair thinning and colours lightening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Portuguese researchers found people who regularly consume sodas and fizzy drinks could dramatically raise their risk of hair loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts, however, have long been divided over whether sodas and fizzy drinks are linked to hair loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Susan Massick, an expert in dermatology at Ohio State University, told Healthline at the time: 'Diet does play a critical role in your overall health, particularly regarding risk for developing obesity, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, and hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, male-pattern hair loss is multifactorial.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While hair loss is usually associated with ageing, dermatologists have said they are increasingly seeing younger men seeking help for the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some going to the extreme, and expensive length, of getting hair transplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's estimated that around a quarter of men in their 20s show signs of balding — but by the age of 50, that figure rises to 85 per cent of men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, earlier this month it was &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14996641/hair-loss-study-pp405.html"&gt;revealed &lt;/a&gt;a breakthrough drug could provide new hair hope for millions of men and women dealing with baldness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medication, called PP405, triggered hair to regrow on the heads of men and women who were balding on the front and to the front and top of their scalp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the phase 2a trial, participants rubbed gel containing the medication onto their scalp daily and saw hair begin to regrow by week eight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 11:48:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxORXBpa2ZvS1BtUHJwSWltX2dxZmJ4ck9Ka3VlX192d2VURl9xYzJvX1hCOVg0TkxLNWlBOFBuRm81Y1dpa0dtZmlzZm00WXNybGJQT1gtY0p4eHJvY1liV0pzVDR6S1NjbWRScklwak1nQnJPWUtqOHRWZ1A4XzF2M3VFR2U3M0pNZGZjT09Td0h0RHUxSVBzOHk5N3NhX0dWVkQwVmJGM3nSAa4BQVVfeXFMTmVLaGVaWV9ZVVg2YVJnaVI5Z0hQZzZKU2RiS0dBLVI3S0ZjVWhIMEhXanFrOHdQN1pSTTBheXZ3emp3a2VOS0NUTHU2YUpXczBSX04xLWZPOUduRW15Ny1zOV9hUXhseEdoanE3Qi15M3RGOXdQdWF5YzFLdy1vOEtpRlg5cUhRZlR1ZmhRWkVmY0FDejRxR2FVMTlJdWtlaGNteU5OR3p0eUs4V1dR</guid></item><item><title>是什么让你头晕？ -《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/08/25/dizzyness-causes-remedies/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XWL3B2ZPCRC2BKBAR23L5RLBUU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;

Some suggest these patterns can resemble what popular culture refers to as a “soul tie.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon of neurons mirroring each other is a thoroughly studied mechanism. When we witness someone expressing emotion or taking action, our neurons reflect that behavior, enhancing empathy and connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this perspective, emotional entanglements might stem more from biology than mysticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This article has been reviewed for accuracy and context by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://independent.academia.edu/DrSarahMeehanOCallaghan" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Sarah Meehan O’Callaghan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, an interdisciplinary researcher whose work explores culture, gender, and psychology.

Why does witnessing another person’s pain stir a physical ache in us? The mirror neuron system (MNS) may explain this reflexive emotional response, according to a 2009 study published in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2865077/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon of neurons mirroring each other is a thoroughly studied mechanism, first documented in monkeys and later explored in humans. These specialized brain cells activate when we act and observe someone else doing the same, as reported in an earlier study published in &lt;a id="journal-title" class="anchor js-title-link anchor-primary anchor-has-background-color anchor-has-inherit-color staff-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3840169/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span class="anchor-text-container"&gt;&lt;span class="anchor-text"&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking experiment demonstrated that emotional pain can become so contagious that it physically registers in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, romantic partners were monitored via brain scans. When one was shown a symbol indicating the other was experiencing pain, the observer’s pain matrix activated without direct physical stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This system enables empathy but can misfire. Judith Orloff, M.D., assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at UCLA and author of The Empath’s Survival Guide, warns that unregulated empathy can lead to emotional burnout (via &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/emotional-freedom/202206/how-the-brains-mirror-neurons-affect-empathy" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In relationships where emotional co-regulation becomes constant and unbalanced, often labeled “soul ties,” boundaries tend to dissolve, leading to enmeshment and a loss of self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Recurring Dreams You Can’t Shake&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="68abfd189315c__880" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/soul-ties/?image_id=68abfd189315c__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="8 Unsettling Signs “Soul Ties” Still Grip You" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/soul-ties/?media_id=68abfd189315c__880" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/68abfd189315c__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/68abfd189315c__880.jpg" alt="Person lying in dim light looking thoughtful and troubled, illustrating unsettling signs of soul ties impact." title="Person lying in dim light looking thoughtful and troubled, illustrating unsettling signs of soul ties impact." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/young-man-suffering-from-insomnia-at-night-6943440/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;cottonbro studio / Pexels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While dreams about falling or teeth cracking are common, repeatedly dreaming about one specific person may indicate a lingering emotional bond or what some might call a “soul tie.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2014 study published in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4704085/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports&lt;/a&gt; found that recurring dream imagery is shaped by the brain’s memory consolidation process during sleep. As memories are reactivated and integrated, they often surface as vivid, meaningful dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we have recurring dreams of an ex-partner, we should take note that dreams are the royal road to the unconscious and wonder what it is about that person that might relate to our childhood or primary caregiver attachments,” said Dr. Sarah Meehan O’Callaghan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, psychologist Dr. Veronika Matutyte explained that recurring dreams often reflect unresolved emotional attachments to individuals who are significant in our lives (per &lt;a href="https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/what-does-it-mean-when-you-dream-about-someone" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Glamour&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dreams featuring ex-partners delve into your romantic and emotional world,” Matutyte said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They can signify longing, unresolved emotions, or reflections on the current state of your romantic life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand recurring dreams, Matutyte recommends keeping a journal to track repeating themes and emotions. She also suggests reflecting on your daily experiences to decode the symbolic meaning behind the dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Physical Sensations at Their Mention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="68abfd829eec9__880" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/soul-ties/?image_id=68abfd829eec9__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="8 Unsettling Signs “Soul Ties” Still Grip You" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/soul-ties/?media_id=68abfd829eec9__880" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/68abfd829eec9__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/68abfd829eec9__880.jpg" alt="Young man lying awake in bed at night, showing signs soul ties still grip with a troubled expression." title="Young man lying awake in bed at night, showing signs soul ties still grip with a troubled expression." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/an-insomniac-man-lying-down-8416435/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;SHVETS production / Pexels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_middle_0" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;That sudden jolt in your stomach or spike in heart rate when someone mentions a certain person might not just be nerves. The somatic-marker hypothesis suggests that these emotional responses are the body’s way of guiding decision-making during uncertain or emotionally charged moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This occurs when physical signals, linked to past emotional experiences, are processed in higher brain regions, as explained in a 2006 study from the &lt;a href="https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/personal/tim.dalgleish/dunnsmhreview.pdf" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systematic desensitization therapy, developed in the 1950s by South African psychologist Joseph Wolpe, offers one method for easing these visceral reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tested initially on anxious cats at Wits University, the approach gradually exposes individuals to triggering stimuli while teaching them relaxation techniques, according to a 2011 study published in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3215612/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Canadian Family Physician&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, it’s widely used for conditions like PTSD, social anxiety, and agoraphobia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cognitive Dissonance When You Reflect&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="68abfde39ebd2__880" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/soul-ties/?image_id=68abfde39ebd2__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="8 Unsettling Signs “Soul Ties” Still Grip You" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/soul-ties/?media_id=68abfde39ebd2__880" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/68abfde39ebd2__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/68abfde39ebd2__880.jpg" alt="Man sitting on bed looking pensive and worried with woman lying in bed behind him, suggesting soul ties emotional struggle." title="Man sitting on bed looking pensive and worried with woman lying in bed behind him, suggesting soul ties emotional struggle." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/bickering-couple-on-bed-11790891/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Rhema / Pexels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reliving emotional pain after a breakup can signal more than just nostalgia it may reflect unresolved psychological tension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Seneca once observed, “We suffer more in imagination than in reality,” a sentiment that captures the impact of nagging rumination, a form of perseverative cognition in which the mind fixates on distressing thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a 2012 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3312901/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Innovations in Clinical Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; study, this repetitive mental loop often deepens emotional discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such ruminative thinking is frequently linked to intrusive thoughts and fractured self-perceptions resulting from relational trauma, as noted in an analysis reported by &lt;a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1029282" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;ERIC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That same study found that intrusive beliefs like thinking one is unlovable explained 28% of the variance in breakup distress.

But when those memories stop you from forming healthy bonds with new people, they may act as barriers instead (per &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/fulfillment-at-any-age/202307/what-you-can-learn-about-yourself-from-your-past-lovers" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_middle_1" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possible explanation lies in oxytocin, the so-called “love hormone,” which is released into the bloodstream by the pituitary gland. While oxytocin strengthens attachment, residual traces after a breakup can skew attraction baselines and delay the ability to form secure new bonds, &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/oxytocin-the-love-hormone" class=" staff-link"&gt;Harvard Health&lt;/a&gt; states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same hormone influences a wide range of social behaviors, from nurturing to anxiety (via &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/understanding-hypnosis/202402/how-oxytocin-affects-our-relationships" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To move forward, therapists often recommend drawing on what attachment theory calls “positive schemas,” mental frameworks that support healthier connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Susan Krauss Whitbourne, Ph.D., Professor Emerita of Psychological and Brain Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, wrote: “A certain kind of nostalgia for your ex, the type that allows you to feel you’ve grown and matured, is what can carry over into your current relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If negative feelings of loss and regret continue to dominate, findings from the University of Kansas suggest redirecting that emotional energy into constructive activities that encourage personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Compulsive Digital Tracking Habits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="68abfe77c8622__880" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/soul-ties/?image_id=68abfe77c8622__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="8 Unsettling Signs “Soul Ties” Still Grip You" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/soul-ties/?media_id=68abfe77c8622__880" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/68abfe77c8622__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/68abfe77c8622__880.jpg" alt="Young woman holding a glass and looking away, showing signs of emotional tension and soul ties in a casual setting." title="Young woman holding a glass and looking away, showing signs of emotional tension and soul ties in a casual setting." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-woman-at-the-bar-5055750/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Ketut Subiyanto / Pexels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself repeatedly checking a former partner’s social media, you may be caught in a dopamine-driven feedback loop. This cycle reinforces itself through the brain’s reward system, creating a pattern that’s hard to break (per &lt;a href="https://outlook.monmouth.edu/2021/03/dopamine-driven-feedback-loops-what-are-they/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Monmouth University&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the brief dopamine rush can feel rewarding, studies show that compulsive tracking is strongly associated with breakup distress and persistent longing for ex-partners (via &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mindful-dating/202208/5-reasons-you-can-t-stop-checking-your-ex-s-social-media" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One study even found that when participants looked at pictures of their exes, the same brain regions linked to physical pain lit up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical psychologist Roxy Zarrabi suggests several strategies for breaking the cycle: delay the urge by five minutes, replace it with a planned activity, focus on why the relationship ended, journal or talk through suppressed feelings, and set firm digital boundaries by temporarily deactivating accounts or blocking your ex (per &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mindful-dating/202210/6-tips-stop-checking-ex-s-social-media" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Shared Unhealthy Behaviors You Never Had&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="68abff248c664__880" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/soul-ties/?image_id=68abff248c664__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="8 Unsettling Signs “Soul Ties” Still Grip You" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/soul-ties/?media_id=68abff248c664__880" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/68abff248c664__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/68abff248c664__880.jpg" alt="Young woman looking upset with a distant man in the background, illustrating signs soul ties still grip you." title="Young woman looking upset with a distant man in the background, illustrating signs soul ties still grip you." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/african-american-couple-arguing-at-home-5699715/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Alex Green / Pexels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_0" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picking up the very behaviors you once criticized in a partner may be explained by observational learning theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduced in the 1960s and 70s by psychologist Albert Bandura, the theory describes how people adopt new behaviors by watching others, remembering what they’ve seen, and later imitating it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process has been studied through mechanisms like rule-governed behavior, imitation, and reinforcement, including a 2011 study published in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3139552/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Analysis of Verbal Behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3139552/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identity fusion can also drive this adoption of unhealthy habits. When individuals feel a profound sense of “oneness” with a partner or group, they may internalize behaviors, good or bad, as part of their shared identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A paper from the &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721414551363" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Association for Psychological Science&lt;/a&gt; highlights how strongly fused people are more likely to take on these actions under emotional or social pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is a spillover effect where negative habits transfer through observational learning and identity fusion, eroding individuality and reinforcing unhealthy dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Overwhelming Guilt When You Set Limits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="68abffaa2b5f3__880" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/soul-ties/?image_id=68abffaa2b5f3__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="8 Unsettling Signs “Soul Ties” Still Grip You" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/soul-ties/?media_id=68abffaa2b5f3__880" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/68abffaa2b5f3__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/68abffaa2b5f3__880.jpg" alt="Man on phone looking stressed while woman watches him, illustrating unsettling signs of soul ties affecting relationships." title="Man on phone looking stressed while woman watches him, illustrating unsettling signs of soul ties affecting relationships." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/man-and-woman-sitting-at-table-6963875/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Mikhail Nilov / Pexels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ilene S. Cohen, Ph.D., psychotherapist and faculty member in Barry University’s Department of Counseling, notes that while guilt can be intended as a moral compass, it often damages relationships and prevents people from honoring their own needs (per &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/your-emotional-meter/201705/when-guilt-keeps-you-setting-boundaries" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She explains that people-pleasers frequently assume responsibility for others’ emotions because they crave being needed. This dynamic pressures them into saying “yes” when they genuinely want to say “no.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Cohen adds, guilt convinces people they can ignore their needs and take on others’ burdens, but over time, this leads to exhaustion and imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapists often analyze this cycle through the lens of codependent dynamics, where one partner becomes “the giver” and sacrifices their well-being for a “taker” who relies on that pattern (via &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/codependency" class=" staff-link"&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="postPoll-9226408" class="post-poll poll-wrapper single-post" data-poll-viewed="false" data-post-id="9226408" data-main-post-id="" data-poll-id="15808"&gt; &lt;input class="post-9226408-poll-value" type="hidden" value="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"&gt; &lt;div data-bind="if: isInitialised()"&gt;    &lt;div data-bind="if: !isLoading() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; isShowingResults"&gt; &lt;div class="poll-content"&gt; &lt;h3 class="answered-content-title"&gt;Thanks!

They’re also rich in polyphenols, which your gut turns into anti-inflammatory compounds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salmon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oily fish contain essential omega-3s, which “can reshape gut microbiome composition and function,” Dr Gill says. “What’s more, regularly eating fish is linked with a lower risk of cognitive decline via the gut-brain axis—the two-way communication between the gut and the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chia seeds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chia seeds are especially high in fiber, providing around 10g per tablespoon which equates to one third of your daily fiber needs (30g a day),” Dr. Gill says. “They are also a rich source of alphalinolenic acid (ALA), an essential plant-based omega-3 and supply an abundance of polyphenols.” Given their capacity to absorb water, “the fiber part of chia seeds can hold around 15 times their weight, so it’s thought that they may have a laxative effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yogurt (with live cultures)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yogurt is a fermented food, meaning specific bacteria were added to produce its specific flavor and texture,” Gargano says. However, not all yogurts are made with probiotics. Her tip is to look for the phrase ‘contains live and active cultures’ on the label, and you’re golden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kefir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kefir is also part of the fermented foods group which introduces “beneficial bacteria that can help restore microbial diversity in the gut.” For the best results, English suggests looking for it “in the fridge aisle, with no added sugar, and not heat-treated, so the bacteria are still alive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kimchi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although unique in the sensory department, kimchi is a wonderful addition to your gut health repertoire. Dr. Adeyemo says that, like other fermented vegetables, kimchi “contains natural probiotics which can help increase the variety of good bacteria in your gut and support healthy digestion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the deal with gut health supplements?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's always best to try and fuel your body with whole foods, but a well-chosen supplement can occasionally support your gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If your diet is limited, you travel a lot, you’re under stress, or you’ve had an illness that’s knocked your gut out of balance, the right supplement can help bridge the gap,” English says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, the difference between prebiotics and probiotics is important here. When choosing supplements, Dr. Adeyemo shares that “probiotics may help maintain microbial diversity, especially after antibiotics, illness or disrupted routines,” while prebiotics are “helpful in nourishing the good bacteria already in the gut”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8878738/"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that synbiotics, which blend the two, “tend to work better than probiotics alone at supporting a balanced microbiome”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be sure to speak to your doctor before taking any supplements, especially if you have pre-existing troubles with your immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared in &lt;a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/"&gt;British GQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZEFVX3lxTFBMaVRqMklaV2JpYldGOFhoZXA0ajJYbHotaXJBbXpOVGhFODBuMWl2ZmJ5VFUtLS15YXVGVzhVNnVPelUxRkctTnRNMTNmNGcxOTFwN0ZxMDJDQ1hodkRiRGZ1dEw</guid></item><item><title>令人震惊的布洛芬副作用不容忽视： MARTIN SCURR博士-《每日邮报》</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15031255/ibuprofen-effect-DR-MARTIN-SCURR-painkiller-deaf.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;Is it possible that the many ibuprofens I have taken over a year (maximum doses) led to me becoming quite deaf?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;Ann Burgess, East Sussex.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Martin Scurr replies:&lt;/span&gt; I'm afraid to say you may well be right. In fact, a link between regular consumption of ibuprofen – a type of drug known as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) – and hearing loss was first identified in a major US study, the Nurses' Health Study, back in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research, which is actually a series of ongoing projects investigating how lifestyle factors influence women's health, revealed that taking ibuprofen more than twice weekly was linked to a 10 per cent higher risk of some degree of sensorineural deafness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a type of hearing loss caused by damage to the hearing mechanism in the inner ear, affecting the delicate hair cells in the cochlea, the spiral-shaped structure in the inner ear that is crucial for hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infection, trauma and chronic exposure to loud noise can all damage the hair cells. With ibuprofen, the mechanism isn't clear, but one theory is that the drug impairs blood flow to the cochlea – the inner ear needs a steady blood supply to function correctly and chemicals called prostaglandins are key to maintaining the correct blood flow. And NSAIDs block prostaglandins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once hair cells are damaged, that's it – they can't be repaired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ibuprofen is now classified as having ototoxic (ear-damaging) effects. Other NSAIDs – indomethacin, naproxen, piroxicam and celecoxib, commonly used to treat pain caused by osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and sports injuries – are also associated with irreversible hearing damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ibuprofen is a type of drug known as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID). Taking it more than twice weekly was linked to a 10 per cent higher risk of some degree of sensorineural deafness in a major study in 2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, aspirin, another type of NSAID, did not have this effect, in women at least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This indicates that whatever condition you need regular pain relief for, you should not continuously use an NSAID long term. It's better to try to adhere to short courses, maybe a week or two maximum, not months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;I am an 82-year-old fairly fit man with no health problems other than suffering from discitis for the past six months. I've been having infusions of antibiotics for about seven weeks. This has now stopped and the lower back pain continues. Will I see an end to this debilitating and depressing condition?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;Frank Allen, Lyme Regis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Martin Scurr replies: &lt;/span&gt;Discitis is a rare but serious condition, where the disc between two bones in the spine becomes chronically inflamed – typically in the lower spine as a result of infection caused by bacteria that's spread via the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The discs have little in the way of blood vessels in them, which limits the immune response, so bacteria can thrive. This leads to intense inflammation: potentially the infection can spread into the bone of the vertebrae either side, and form an abscess, affecting the nerves running in the spinal canal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Discitis is typically caused by staphylococci bacteria, found naturally on the skin. Discitis is more common in those with weakened immune systems, including older people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of my patients suffered this condition some years ago, caused by salmonella, which we had to assume gained access to his body from food. Like yourself, the patient was a man in his eighties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The treatment involves a long course of high-dose antibiotics which must be given intravenously to ensure high levels in the blood. Usually this would continue for 12 weeks. Strict rest is important. In rare cases, surgery may be required to drain the abscess between the vertebrae.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The persisting pain is not uncommon but your spinal specialist team can always refer you to pain control specialists. Your symptoms should settle entirely in the following months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;IN MY VIEW: Insurers shouldn't give health advice &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many people are having to raid their savings, their pension funds and even family coffers to purchase treatment in the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seduced by the smart marketing, they often don't realise until too late that insurers impose strict rules governing any claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What also deeply worries me is that general practice is not covered. Instead, these insurers see themselves as guiding their customers through the so-called 'healthcare journey'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But patients need to be wary: the only professionals who are trained and entitled to guide patients through the 'healthcare journey' are GPs. Insurance firms have only one motive, the drive to increase profits, which means ensuring their customers receive the cheapest option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This isn't necessarily the best or the most appropriate. Not least, the insurer does not know the patient and their history, let alone their psychology, so how can they choose the best treatment options?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So regard the advice given by an insurer with great caution, including the recommended specialist. If in doubt, your GP is the best guide – both in terms of specialist and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;Write to Dr Scurr at Good Health, Daily Mail, 9 Derry Street, London, W8 5HY or email drmartin@dailymail.co.uk - include your contact details. Replies should be taken in a general context and always consult your own GP with any health worries. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;KIGALI, Rwanda — In a landmark first for the continent hardest hit by HIV, a new clinical trial in South Africa has delivered a rare but extraordinary outcome: One young woman may be cured of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The story begins in May 2016 when Anele got a call from nurses at a local clinical research center in Umlazi township, which lies in South Africa's southeastern province of KwaZulu-Natal. They told her she needed to come in for an urgent appointment, before breaking the news in person that she had tested positive for HIV. She felt like her world had ended.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I cried a lot," recalled Anele, now 32, speaking to a group of assembled scientists, doctors and health officials on the first day at the International AIDS Society (IAS) conference in Kigali, Rwanda in mid-July. "I was only 23. That day, I was not OK at all." Anele explained at the IAS conference that she did not want to be fully identified due to the ongoing stigma associated with being HIV positive in Umlazi.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It may not have felt like it at the time, but compared with the &lt;a href="https://www.spotlightnsp.co.za/2025/03/31/8-million-people-living-with-hiv-in-sa-according-to-latest-estimates/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;estimated 5.2 million&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; other women living with HIV in South Africa, Anele was fortunate. Her early diagnosis and treatment plan were only possible because of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7593829/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a new social empowerment and medical &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;program called &lt;a href="https://ragoninstitute.org/fresh/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;FRESH&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Females Rising through Education, Support and Health) which had begun in Umlazi back in 2012.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Six years after Anele's diagnosis, this program would see her enrolled in the first-ever clinical trial to attempt to cure HIV patients in Africa.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A trial born in Umlazi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhiv/article/PIIS2352-3018(25)00193-6/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;July 2025 article&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the medical journal &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;, 10 people&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;worldwide&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;are considered cured of HIV after receiving stem cell transplants to treat aggressive blood cancer, which happened to destroy the virus. But that method is not considered safe or scalable. In recent years other "cure trials" have explored newer approaches including &lt;a href="https://www.eatg.org/hiv-news/first-in-human-trial-of-crispr-gene-therapy-for-hiv/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;gene editing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/news/headlines/clinical-trial-begins-using-car-t-cells-to-potentially-cure-hiv/2023/04" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CAR T-cell therapy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to enhance immune response, but they have yet to yield successful results.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But almost all of these trials have taken place in the U.S. Yet 67% of the 40.8 million people living with HIV are in Africa where genetic and demographic profiles are remarkably different, said &lt;a href="https://hivmedicine.ukzn.ac.za/discipline-staff/professor-thumbi-ndungu/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Thumbi Ndung'u&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, who led the lab work for the trial.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"In the West, the epidemic is predominantly in white, homosexual men, while in Africa, the majority of people living with HIV tend to be younger and female," Ndung'u told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This matters for several reasons. Biological responses to HIV differ between men and women, influenced by sex hormones. Yet, said &lt;a href="https://researchers.mgh.harvard.edu/profile/914051/Krista-Dong" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Krista Dong&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and FRESH's clinical director, women are vastly underrepresented in cure trials. "Women make up 53% of global HIV infections, but they're grossly underrepresented," Dong noted.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-84718" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The biology of the virus also varies by region. While the dominant HIV strain in North America and Europe is clade B, sub-Saharan Africa sees mostly clades A, C, and D. Clade C, the world's most common subtype, has distinct features in how it interacts with the immune system, which potentially affects the success of curative therapies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"To develop a cure intervention that has an impact, we have to make sure it is something that works in Africa," Ndung'u said. "And the only way we can ensure that's the case is by actually doing the trials in these populations."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A strategy of kick and kill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;FRESH has taken a different approach from earlier HIV programs. In KwaZulu-Natal, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7593829/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;researchers have long noted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that young women are particularly vulnerable to infection due to socioeconomic factors, including financial dependence on male partners and limited access to education or employment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.iasociety.org/sites/default/files/Events/2022-HIV-Cure/18-The-FRESH-Cohort_Krista-Dong.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Launched&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2012 in Umlazi, where more than 60% of young women contract HIV before age 23, FRESH offered twice-weekly HIV testing along with an empowerment curriculum that included lessons on self-esteem and gender-based violence as well as career mentoring. Initially funded by private philanthropy and later the Gates Foundation, the program helped participants resume schooling or gain employment, while allowing researchers to detect HIV infections within days. (The Gates Foundation is a sponsor of NPR and this blog.)&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Having such frequent testing meant that the FRESH team could identify new HIV infections within a matter of days, enabling women to immediately start antiretroviral medication to suppress the virus, limiting the size and diversity of the viral reservoir. In theory, they would be easier to cure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2022, the clinical trial began. Twenty women enrolled, including Anele. All of them had been on antiretroviral therapy for an average of seven years. Sponsored by California-based drugmaker &lt;a href="https://www.gilead.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Gilead Sciences&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the trial used a new strategy: It aimed to flush HIV out of hiding, then neutralize it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The approach used a unique drug called vesatolimod to kick HIV out of its hiding places in the body, followed by a one-time infusion of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) on day seven. These antibodies, tailored to target clade C, would bind to the virus and summon immune cells to eliminate it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"HIV doesn't live in our blood, it lives in reservoirs whether in the lymph nodes or the liver or the brain, so you need to kick it out, so that the bNAbs can reach it," Dong said. "So what we were going for was this strategy of kick and kill."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over 20 weeks, participants received vesatolimod biweekly. Then, on day 35, they were asked to stop their antiretrovirals.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They had access to counselors and a community advisory board from the University of KwaZulu-Natal and FRESH staff, assuring that they would be monitored extremely closely. But when they were first diagnosed, nurses had emphasized that they would need to take antiretrovirals for the rest of their lives. Stopping this treatment came as a shock.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The antiretroviral pause also carried real risks. When HIV rebounds, it can cause inflammation and raise the risk of transmission, but as Ndung'u explained, stopping this treatment is currently the only way to assess whether a patient is truly in remission. "We had to make sure that the participants fully understood the risks," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Within a year, 16 participants saw their virus rebound and resumed treatment — but four remained in remission, with undetectable viral loads.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potentially cured&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the coming years, understanding what set the four women who stayed in remission apart could yield vital clues about who might benefit most from this treatment approach.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While Ndung'u and Dong don't yet have firm answers, they have hypotheses. Ndung'u suspects genetic factors may have helped the four women mount a more effective immune response. Dong is investigating why the therapy failed in the other 16 – whether their viral reservoirs were larger or their immune systems reacted negatively to one of the drugs. Unraveling these differences could be key to improving future strategies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The pair are eager to continue. Ndung'u hopes to launch a trial involving women infected at an unknown time — representing a more typical HIV population and possibly giving the antibodies more viral material to act on.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's also growing interest in how future cure trials might include participants with co-infections common in sub-Saharan Africa, such as tuberculosis or hepatitis B. "That's a unique but important challenge," &lt;a href="https://noguchi.ug.edu.gh/fellows/dr-helena-lamptey%EF%BF%BC/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Helena Lamptey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an immunology researcher at the University of Ghana, told NPR. "Many people with HIV have co-infections which are impacting the immune system and possibly helping HIV to persist." Cure strategies will need to reflect that reality.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For now, FRESH stands as a milestone. Of the four women who remained in remission at the trials' end, one later experienced a viral rebound. Two others chose to resume antiretrovirals – one for convenience after starting a new job that made weekly monitoring difficult, and the other to ensure a safe pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That leaves Anele. More than two years after stopping medication, she remains HIV-free and off treatment. While she remains cautious about declaring herself cured, Dong believes that it is a very real possibility.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Her case is fueling interest across the region. Researchers in countries such as Botswana have expressed the desire to run their own trials. With other new treatment possibilities emerging such as therapeutic vaccines and more advanced, long-lasting antibody infusions which Dong calls "super bNAbs," there is genuine optimism that a corner has finally been turned for people with HIV in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Even though the FRESH trial was not a home run, achieving long-term viral control in 20% of the participants is exciting," Dong said. "It has brought hope to the community that progress is being made."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;David Cox is a freelance health journalist who has written for publications around the world including NPR, &lt;/em&gt;The New York Times, Wired&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;The Guardian.&lt;em&gt; He has a Ph.D. in neuroscience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
