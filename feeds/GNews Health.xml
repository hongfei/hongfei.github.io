For many, the way their brains work means they struggle with tasks that require focus and planning, which, at the lower end, means daily stress and inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sometimes, it's a recipe for disaster. For example, a&lt;span&gt;dults with ADHD are more at risk &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1741-7015-10-99"&gt;road accidents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7215254/"&gt;motor vehicle injuries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2810131"&gt;traffic tickets, and hard braking events&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Studies have found that stimulant medications, such as Ritalin, can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/adhd-medication-could-literally-add-years-to-some-peoples-lives"&gt;literally add years to some people's lives&lt;/a&gt;. These stimulants &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-do-stimulants-actually-work-to-reduce-adhd-symptoms-215801"&gt;increase the amount of key neurotransmitters&lt;/a&gt; in the brain, and improve attention, impulse control and decision-making.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study adds &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1741-7015-10-99"&gt;further evidence&lt;/a&gt; that these drugs can tackle some of the most serious outcomes people with ADHD face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the &lt;span&gt;Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden led the study, drawing on data from 148,581 patients, ranging from 6 to 64-years-old, who received an ADHD diagnosis between 2007 and 2018. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients who started drug treatment (about 57 percent) within three months of diagnosis saw reduced risk across most of the serious outcomes assessed. In about 88 percent of cases, the drug they took was methylphenidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medication reduced the risk of first-time substance misuse by 15 percent, and recurrent misuse by 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It reduced first-time suicidal behavior by 17 percent, and subsequent suicide attempts by 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First instances of criminal behavior were reduced by 13 percent, and repeat instances, by 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also found medication reduced the risk of first-time traffic accidents by 12 percent, and recurrent events by 16 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Oftentimes there is no information on what the risks are if you don't treat ADHD," study author and psychiatrist Samuele Cortese, from the University of Southampton, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr2j792drro"&gt;told journalist Philippa Roxby at the BBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Now we have evidence they [ADHD medications] can reduce these risks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2024-083658"&gt;British Medical Journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If this story has raised concerns or you need to talk to someone, &lt;a href="http://www.suicidestop.com/call_a_hotline.html"&gt;please consult this list to find a 24/7 crisis hotline in your country, and reach out for help.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The research found that both random noise and a non-random pure tone had similar effects on a brain activity measure linked to neural noise, which contradicts key assumptions of the prominent moderate brain arousal model. These findings were published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10870547251357074" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Attention Disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists have observed that listening to random auditory noise, like white or pink noise, can benefit cognitive functioning in individuals with ADHD or elevated traits of the condition. The moderate brain arousal model was proposed to explain this phenomenon. This model is built on two primary assumptions. First, it suggests that ADHD is associated with lower-than-optimal levels of internal neural noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, it proposes that external random noise boosts this internal neural noise through a mechanism called stochastic resonance, improving the brain’s ability to process signals. However, these foundational ideas had not been sufficiently tested, particularly because most studies lacked a direct measure of neural noise or a proper non-random sound condition to isolate the effects of stochastic resonance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joske Rijmen and her colleagues at Ghent University aimed to directly test these two core assumptions of the moderate brain arousal model. They designed an experiment to measure neural noise directly while participants listened to different types of sound. The researchers wanted to see if ADHD traits were indeed linked to lower neural noise at baseline. They also sought to determine if the effects of sound on brain activity were specific to random noise, as the theory of stochastic resonance would predict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conduct their investigation, the researchers recruited 69 neurotypical adults. Participants first completed the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale, a questionnaire used to assess the number and frequency of symptoms associated with the condition. This allowed the scientists to examine ADHD as a spectrum of traits rather than a simple diagnostic category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant then underwent a resting-state electroencephalogram, a non-invasive procedure that records the brain’s electrical activity. While their brain activity was monitored, participants sat with their eyes closed for three distinct two-minute periods: one in silence, one while listening to continuous pink noise (a random signal), and one while listening to a continuous 100 Hz pure tone (a non-random signal).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team analyzed the electroencephalogram data by focusing on a specific feature known as the aperiodic slope of the power spectral density. This measure reflects background brain activity that is not part of rhythmic brain waves and is considered a direct index of neural noise. A steeper slope in this measurement corresponds to less neural noise, while a flatter slope indicates more neural noise. By examining how this slope changed across the different sound conditions and in relation to participants’ ADHD traits, the scientists could test the predictions of the moderate brain arousal model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings presented a direct challenge to the model’s first assumption. During the silent condition, the researchers found a relationship between ADHD traits and the aperiodic slope. Individuals who reported more traits of ADHD tended to have a flatter slope. This finding suggests that they had more background neural noise, not less. The result is the opposite of what the moderate brain arousal model predicted and aligns with other recent studies that have also found evidence for increased neural noise in older children and adolescents with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also contradicted the model’s second assumption regarding the mechanism of stochastic resonance. When participants with elevated ADHD traits listened to pink noise, their aperiodic slope became steeper. This change signifies a reduction in their neural noise. This outcome is contrary to the model’s suggestion that random noise should increase neural noise in this group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most significantly, the researchers found that the non-random pure tone had a virtually identical effect on brain activity as the pink noise. Listening to the 100 Hz tone also led to a steeper aperiodic slope, or a decrease in neural noise, in participants with higher levels of ADHD traits. The fact that a non-random sound produced the same effect as a random sound strongly questions the idea that stochastic resonance, which requires a random signal, is the necessary mechanism behind the benefits of auditory stimulation. If stochastic resonance were the driving force, only the pink noise should have produced this effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors propose that an alternative explanation may be needed. Rather than relying on stochastic resonance, both types of sound might have a more general effect on brain arousal. This idea is more consistent with the state regulation deficit account of ADHD, which suggests that individuals with the condition have difficulty regulating their arousal levels to match situational demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to this view, any form of additional stimulation, not just random noise, could help modulate arousal to a more optimal state. The researchers also noted the puzzling observation that stimulation appeared to decrease brain arousal in individuals with higher ADHD traits. They speculate this might relate to difficulties these individuals have in achieving a truly restful state, and the continuous sound may have helped them to calm or regulate their brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has some limitations that the authors acknowledge. The research was conducted with neurotypical adults who varied in their traits of ADHD, so the findings need to be replicated in a group of individuals with a formal clinical diagnosis. Another point is that the brain activity was measured during a resting state, not while participants were engaged in a cognitive task where the benefits of noise are typically observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research should explore whether these same brain activity patterns occur during tasks that require attention and focus. Investigating these effects in a clinical sample of people with diagnosed ADHD will be an important next step to confirm these conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10870547251357074" target="_blank"&gt;Pink Noise and a Pure Tone Both Reduce 1/f Neural Noise in Adults With Elevated ADHD Traits: A Critical Appraisal of the Moderate Brain Arousal Model&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Joske Rijmen, Mehdi Senoussi, and Jan R.

							&lt;p&gt;There’s no shortage of supplements claiming to boost focus, sharpen memory, or keep your brain young.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s the truth. No pill can replace what real daily habits do for your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your brain isn’t a static organ. It’s constantly adapting, responding, and reshaping itself based on what you do, eat, think, and feel. Research in psychology shows that lifestyle choices have far greater effects on brain health than any supplement ever could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to protect your brain long-term, start with these nine powerful habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1) Get consistent, quality sleep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep is your brain’s nightly reset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you rest, your brain clears out waste, stores memories, and repairs connections that keep your thinking sharp. Skipping rest doesn’t just make you tired. It slows down attention, weakens focus, and makes emotional regulation harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies from the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/sleep-deprivation/health-effects" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; show that even one night of poor sleep affects how your brain processes information. Over time, chronic sleep loss can contribute to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, treat sleep as non-negotiable. Aim for seven to eight hours every night. Keep your room dark, avoid screens before bed, and go to sleep at the same time each evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good sleep is free medicine for your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2) Move your body every day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise is one of the best things you can do for mental clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you move, your brain receives more oxygen and nutrients. Movement also releases neurochemicals that boost mood, sharpen focus, and help create new brain connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to train like an athlete. Even &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/things-to-do/k-if-you-commit-to-these-5-weekly-activities-youll-age-better-than-95-of-your-peers/"&gt;moderate activities&lt;/a&gt; like brisk walking, yoga, or cycling help your brain perform better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I’ve found that going for a run in the morning clears mental fog faster than coffee. The rhythm of movement resets my thoughts and sets the tone for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise isn’t just about muscles or fitness. It’s brain fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3) Feed your brain nutrients it actually needs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you eat has a direct impact on how you think and feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research consistently links diet quality with &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-024-00226-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;. The Mediterranean diet, for instance, is rich in omega-3s, antioxidants, and plant-based foods that protect brain cells from inflammation and oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eat more foods that support long-term brain health:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leafy greens like spinach and kale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Berries for antioxidants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nuts and seeds for healthy fats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whole grains for steady energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legumes for protein and fiber&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who eats vegan, I’ve seen how clean energy from whole foods keeps my mind focused throughout the day. Processed foods, sugar, and alcohol, on the other hand, can make your brain sluggish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to overhaul your diet overnight. Just make more choices that feed your mind instead of depleting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4) Keep learning new things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain loves novelty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning strengthens neural pathways and increases plasticity, which helps your mind stay flexible and creative. It doesn’t have to mean going back to school. Try reading new subjects, learning an instrument, or practicing a language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/gen-8-signs-youre-far-more-capable-than-you-give-yourself-credit-for-according-to-psychology/"&gt;you challenge yourself&lt;/a&gt; to learn, your brain forms fresh connections. This process keeps it strong well into older age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned before that when I started diving into behavioral psychology, it completely changed how I viewed human decision-making. That mental challenge reignited my curiosity and made me realize how important lifelong learning really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time you learn something new, your brain literally upgrades itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5) Spend time in nature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-65565" src="https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50.png" alt="" srcset="https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50.png 1600w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50-300x158.png 300w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50-1024x538.png 1024w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50-768x403.png 768w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50-1536x806.png 1536w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50-1200x630.png 1200w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50-857x450.png 857w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50-900x473.png 900w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50-420x221.png 420w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50-840x441.png 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your brain wasn’t designed to stare at screens all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nature helps it recharge. The sounds, colors, and movement of natural environments soothe the nervous system and improve focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have found that even short &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272494425002713#:~:text=A%20consistent%20body%20of%20evidence,et%20al.%2C%202015)." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;exposure to nature&lt;/a&gt; reduces stress hormones and restores attention. Just 20 minutes outdoors can improve cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to grab my camera and head to the nearest park when I need a reset. Observing light, trees, and patterns in nature always brings me back to the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need a mountain trail to get the benefits. A walk around your block or sitting under a tree works just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6) Practice mindfulness or meditation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A wandering mind is an anxious mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness trains your brain to stay in the present, reducing stress and increasing clarity. Regular meditation strengthens the prefrontal cortex, which handles focus, decision-making, and self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to meditate for hours. Even five to ten minutes of quiet breathing or paying full attention to what you’re doing can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find traditional meditation difficult, try mindful walking, cooking, or simply taking a pause before responding to something stressful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calm attention is one of the most powerful habits for long-term brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7) Nurture real social connections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human beings are wired for connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong relationships don’t just make you happier; they protect your brain. &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Research from Harvard’s&lt;/a&gt; long-term adult development study shows that meaningful social ties are one of the strongest predictors of both happiness and cognitive longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loneliness, on the other hand, has been linked to memory loss and depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make time for friends, family, or even small daily interactions with neighbors or coworkers. The conversations you have, the laughter you share, and the empathy you give all stimulate your brain’s social and emotional circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make a point to call a friend or grab coffee with someone at least once a week. It’s not about networking or small talk. It’s about staying human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your brain thrives when it feels connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8) Manage your stress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stress is unavoidable, but chronic stress is harmful to your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-term exposure to cortisol, the body’s stress hormone, can damage neurons in the hippocampus, which is responsible for memory and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/gen-the-art-of-staying-calm-7-habits-of-people-who-never-lose-their-cool/"&gt;Managing stress&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t mean eliminating challenges. It means giving your brain space to recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try breathwork, physical activity, time outdoors, or any routine that helps you slow down. I like to end my evenings by putting my phone away, having tea, and reading a few pages of a good book. It tells my brain it’s time to wind down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balance is what keeps your brain resilient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9) Get comfortable with boredom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world full of constant stimulation, boredom has become rare. Yet it’s one of the healthiest states for creativity and problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your brain isn’t flooded with information, it activates what neuroscientists call the “&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/default-mode-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;default mode network&lt;/a&gt;,” which helps you process experiences and form new insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of your best ideas come when you stop trying to have them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So resist the urge to reach for your phone every time you feel restless. Sit in silence. Let your mind wander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boredom gives your brain space to connect dots you didn’t even know were there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need supplements to protect your brain. You need consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These nine habits might sound simple, but they work because they align with how your brain naturally thrives. Sleep, movement, learning, calmness, and connection — these are what keep your mind strong for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you care for your brain daily, you’ll notice the difference not just in how well you think, but in how fully you live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take it one day at a time, and your brain will thank you for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="article-content-area"&gt;&lt;p id="article-123"&gt;Rates of one type of breast cancer — invasive lobular carcinoma — have been rising in the United States more than three times faster than those of all other breast cancers combined over the past decade, according to a new study.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This elusive breast cancer that’s hard to spot in routine mammograms is behind more than 1 in 10 cases nationwide.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The research, published in Cancer, the journal of the American Cancer Society, analyzed national data from 2012 to 2021 and found that rates of invasive lobular carcinoma increased by about 2.8% each year, while rates of all other breast cancer rose by about 0.8% a year.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
What exactly is invasive lobular carcinoma, and how common is it? How is it diagnosed, and why can it be more difficult to find during screenings? Who is most at risk? What are the treatment options? And what should women know about reducing their risk of developing this and other types of breast cancer?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness medical expert Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at the George Washington University. Wen previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CNN: What is invasive lobular carcinoma, and how common is it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Dr Leana Wen&lt;/b&gt;: Invasive lobular carcinoma, also known as ILC or lobular breast cancer, is a type of breast cancer that begins in the milk-producing glands of the breast, called lobules, and then spreads into nearby tissue. These malignant tumors are often hormone receptor-positive, meaning the cancer cells grow in response to estrogen or progesterone.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
ILC is the second most common type of breast cancer, after invasive ductal carcinoma, and accounts for 10% to 15% of all new breast cancer diagnoses, according to the National Cancer Institute. About 47,500 ILC cases are diagnosed in the US each year, and more women are diagnosed with it than with brain, kidney, liver, pancreatic or ovarian cancer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CNN: Why is ILC often more difficult to find with routine mammograms?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Wen&lt;/b&gt;: This type of tumor tends to grow in a way that doesn’t change the breast’s structure as much as other cancers. Instead of forming a defined mass, the cancer cells spread through the tissue in thin strands that appear more like normal breast tissue on imaging. Because of this, mammograms may show only subtle changes, or sometimes none at all. Women may also be less likely to feel a distinct lump during a breast self-exam, which can delay detection.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CNN: What other imaging is used to diagnose ILC?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Wen&lt;/b&gt;: A breast ultrasound can help spot areas of thickened tissue that don’t show up on a mammogram, and a breast MRI provides a more detailed view that can reveal cancers hidden in dense breast tissue.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
These tests aren’t routinely recommended for everyone. Mammography remains the standard screening tool for most women. But those at higher risk, including women with dense breasts and those with a strong family history of breast cancer or known genetic mutations, may be advised to have an ultrasound or MRI in addition to regular mammograms.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CNN: What does this study show in terms of the rise of cases and who is most at risk?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Wen&lt;/b&gt;: Researchers found that ILC has been increasing across every racial and ethnic group, but the steepest rise was seen among Asian American and Pacific Islander women, whose incidence grew by about 4.4% each year in the study period. Age is also a risk factor, as women 65 and older are more likely to be diagnosed with ILC than with invasive ductal carcinoma. About 70% of new ILC cases were diagnosed in women 60 and older; the median age of diagnosis is 66.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CNN: How do the study authors explain the rise especially in this type of breast cancer?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Wen&lt;/b&gt;: Several factors may be driving this greater increase. Because ILC is strongly linked to hormones, changes in hormone exposure over time could be part of the reason. Rising rates of obesity and alcohol use, along with changes in childbearing and menopause patterns, may also contribute to the steady increase.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Improvement in diagnosis and greater awareness of ILC may be leading to more accurate identification. Some lobular cancers may have been misclassified as ductal cancers in the past, so part of the rise may reflect better recognition. In addition, more women are living longer after menopause, which can increase the likelihood of developing ILC compared with other types of breast cancer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CNN: What are the treatment options for ILC?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Wen&lt;/b&gt;: Treatment is similar to that for other breast cancers. Surgery to remove the tumor, followed by radiation, is common, as is hormonal therapy, since most tumors grow in response to estrogen or progesterone. Chemotherapy may be used in some cases. For advanced disease, newer targeted drugs combined with hormonal therapy can help slow progression and improve outcomes. However, ILC may have greater resistance to treatment, especially in more advanced disease, and tends to carry a poorer prognosis once it has spread.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CNN: How can women reduce their risk of developing ILC and other types of breast cancer?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Wen&lt;/b&gt;: Some risk factors can’t be changed, such as age or family history, but many lifestyle choices can make a difference. Quitting smoking, limiting alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight and staying physically active all help lower the risk of breast cancer. Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains supports overall health and may reduce inflammation linked to cancer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Regular screening and knowing what’s normal for your breasts are key for early detection. Talk with your doctor about your risk factors and decide together when you should begin screening and whether you need tests in addition to a mammogram.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Finally, pay attention to changes in your breasts, such as thickening, swelling, nipple discharge, different colors or new areas of fullness, and seek medical evaluation as soon as something looks or feels different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This DNA damage is a well-known factor in the development of aging and cancer, yet scientists have long struggled to understand the exact link -- especially how DNA-damaged stem cells affect tissue health over time.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) are specialized cells that give rise to melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells responsible for the color of our hair and skin. In mammals, these stem cells are found in a region of the hair follicle known as the bulge-sub-bulge area. Here, they exist as immature melanoblasts, ensuring that hair and skin maintain their color through repeated cycles of regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discovering How DNA Damage Drives Hair Graying&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published online on October 6, 2025, in &lt;em&gt;Nature Cell Biology&lt;/em&gt;, a study led by Professor Emi Nishimura and Assistant Professor Yasuaki Mohri at The University of Tokyo explored how McSCs react to different types of DNA damage. Using long-term lineage tracing and gene expression profiling in mice, the researchers discovered that when McSCs experience DNA double-strand breaks, they undergo a process known as senescence-coupled differentiation (seno-differentiation). In this state, the stem cells permanently mature and are eventually lost, which leads to hair turning gray. The process is controlled by the activation of the p53-p21 signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When McSCs are exposed to certain carcinogens, including 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene or ultraviolet B radiation, they do not follow the same protective path. Even with DNA damage present, these cells avoid seno-differentiation and continue to renew themselves. They expand clonally instead, aided by KIT ligand signals released from surrounding tissue and the epidermis. These niche-derived signals block the protective differentiation response, pushing the stem cells toward a cancer-prone state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opposing Cellular Fates: Graying or Cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Nishimura, "These findings reveal that the same stem cell population can follow antagonistic fates -- exhaustion or expansion -- depending on the type of stress and microenvironmental signals." She adds, "It reframes hair graying and melanoma not as unrelated events, but as divergent outcomes of stem cell stress responses."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasize that their findings do not imply that developing gray hair prevents cancer. Instead, seno-differentiation appears to serve as a stress-triggered defense mechanism that removes damaged stem cells before they can become harmful. When this safeguard fails or is bypassed, those damaged cells can survive and potentially lead to melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linking Aging, Cancer, and Cellular Self-Destruction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By uncovering the molecular pathways that determine whether stem cells undergo protective exhaustion or dangerous expansion, this study connects the biology of tissue aging with cancer formation. It also highlights the value of naturally removing compromised stem cells through "senolysis," a biological process that helps prevent cancer by sacrificing cells that could otherwise become malignant.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s most commonly found in &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/geographic-atrophy/symptoms-causes/syc-20582973" data-link="native" class=""&gt;people over 60&lt;/a&gt; and can cause irreversible blindness, affecting over &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2501396" data-link="native" class=""&gt;5 million people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide — and an &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11695844/#:~:text=BACKGROUND%3A,in%20at%20least%201%20eye." data-link="native" class=""&gt;estimated 1 million&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. The condition destroys photoreceptor cells in the retina, the neural tissue in the back of the eye responsible for transforming light into electrical signals for the brain.

The glasses — a prototype which Palanker admits is a “little awkward-looking” —  have an attached camera that captures images and then projects them, via infrared light, to the chip. Meanwhile, the 2-by-2-millimeter chip — implanted into the patients’ damaged retinas — converts those images into electrical stimulation, restoring sight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0 ruduv2y"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to a household key, the chip pales in size. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Science Corporation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 32 participants who completed the clinical trial — all older than 60 and with sight worse than &lt;a href="https://www.nvisioncenters.com/improve-eyesight/20-100-vision-and-up/" data-link="native" class=""&gt;20/320&lt;/a&gt; in at least one eye. Once they had the new technology, some could make out patterns immediately, while it took others months of training before their sight improved. A year after receiving the device, the vast majority — 27 people — had regained the ability to read, though they could only see a few letters at a time. With their artificial retinas, some could read with 20/42. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nineteen trial participants experienced side effects, such as pressure, tears and bleeding — though most of these issues resolved within two months.

		&lt;p&gt;Grey mornings steal the colour from the sky, coats get heavier, and energy seems to drain faster than the daylight. Colds circle like gossip, nails snap, moods dip, and sleep feels less restorative than it should. There’s a quiet culprit behind so many November slumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bus heater fogs the windows as a woman in a wool scarf taps her Oyster card and stares at the faint sun, a pale coin behind the cloud. In the office, she eats porridge by a screen that glows brighter than the day outside, then walks home under street lamps that flicker before five. Small aches, a steady tiredness, a sense that coffee does less than it used to. The clocks didn’t just shift time; they shifted her body’s chemistry, one missing light signal at a time. It’s the sunshine you can’t see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874125"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The invisible gap November brings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call it what it is: **vitamin D** is the thing many women are running short on in November. The sun sits low and the angle means UVB barely reaches you at all in the UK. Winter coats cover skin, commutes happen in the dark, and lunch breaks are swallowed by rain. Your bones, muscles, immune cells and even mood circuitry use this nutrient like a language. When it fades, life feels heavier than it should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take Priya, 34, who works in an NHS scheduling office in Lewisham. By mid-November she was skipping her evening Pilates because her legs felt leaden and her motivation fell off a cliff. Her GP, familiar with that seasonal pattern, suggested a blood test and a simple daily supplement. She felt steadier by January. In the background, the UK’s own data echoes her story: roughly one in five people have low vitamin D levels in winter and spring, with higher risk if you have darker skin or keep most of your skin covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874126"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a clean logic to it. The north-of-50-degrees latitude means the sun’s UVB is too weak from roughly October to March for most people to make vitamin D in skin. Food helps, but not much: oily fish, egg yolks and fortified milks offer only small amounts, and vegetarian choices are slimmer still. Melanin reduces vitamin D synthesis, city living limits daylight, and desk jobs do the rest. The body tries to coast on summer stores, then—bang—November arrives and the tank runs low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="The #1 Vitamin Every Woman Needs for Hormonal Balance (Backed by Science!)" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oQWQRotp2ss?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874128"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to top up without turning your life upside down&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest play is boring, which is why it works: take **10 micrograms (400 IU)** of vitamin D daily through autumn and winter. That’s the UK guidance for adults, including women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Put the bottle next to the kettle or toothbrush and swallow it with your main meal, as fat helps absorption. If you prefer plant-based, look for D3 from lichen; it’s vegan and widely available. Tiny habit, big return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest: nobody really does that every day. The trick is to lower the friction. Buy a three-month supply in one go. Set a phone reminder for the time you naturally pause, like after lunch. If you regularly forget, a weekly dose can be discussed with your GP or pharmacist. Don’t chase mega-doses on your own, and don’t exceed the UK’s safe upper limit of 100 micrograms (4,000 IU) a day. If you have kidney issues, take certain medications, or have a health condition affecting calcium, ask your clinician for personalised advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874129"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food still counts, but think of it as a nudge, not the fix. A tin of sardines on toast, mushrooms exposed to UV light, fortified yoghurt or plant milks slipped into porridge. Your plate can support what the sky won’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“November is when vitamin D goes quiet in Britain,” says a London-based dietitian. “A small, consistent supplement bridges that silence for bone, immune and mood support.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick D3 where you can; vegan D3 exists and works well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anchor the tablet to a daily cue: kettle, keys, or toothbrush.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat oily fish once or twice a week if you enjoy it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for “fortified with vitamin D” on milks and cereals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you cover most skin or have darker skin, speak to your GP about year-round needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What this means for your November&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve all had that moment when the early dark feels like it’s winning. The good news is you can change the odds with a habit so small it barely dents your day. Think of vitamin D as a winter foundation—quiet, unflashy, stabilising—so your energy, focus, and sense of steadiness don’t rely on rare blue skies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It won’t fix everything. It can shift the background, the slow hum your body runs on as you stack work, family, and the life you’d still like to live when the sun clocks off at four. If you share a house, make it a household ritual, like tapping the lights off at night or topping the fruit bowl. One tiny pill, the same time, each day. In the gloom of November, that kind of predictability feels like a small act of resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;FAQ :&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I get enough vitamin D from the sun in November in the UK?&lt;/strong&gt;Not realistically. The sun’s UVB angle is too low for most of the UK, even at midday. Short outdoor time is still great for mood and movement, but it won’t cover vitamin D.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I choose D2 or D3?&lt;/strong&gt;D3 tends to raise and maintain blood levels more effectively. Vegan D3 from lichen is widely available if you avoid animal products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the safest dose to take daily?&lt;/strong&gt;For most adults, **10 micrograms (400 IU)** daily through autumn and winter is advised in the UK. Don’t exceed 100 micrograms (4,000 IU) a day unless your clinician recommends it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How soon might I feel a difference?&lt;/strong&gt;Some people notice steadier energy within a few weeks, while others simply avoid the slow slide they felt in past winters. The body is topping up a low reservoir, which takes time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I’m pregnant, breastfeeding, or have a health condition?&lt;/strong&gt;Stick with 10 micrograms daily unless your midwife or doctor advises otherwise. If you have kidney problems, sarcoidosis, high calcium, or take certain medicines, get personalised guidance first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The "gut microbiome" has become a popular health term in recent years. It's easy to see why, with an abundance of research showing how important the trillions of microbes living in our gut are for health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what many people might not realize is that the microbiome doesn't only contain bacteria. It also contains other types of microbes – including fungi. The fungal component of the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/gut-microbiome-1624"&gt;microbiome&lt;/a&gt; is called the "mycobiome".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the mycobiome has been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2020.572538"&gt;less well studied&lt;/a&gt; than its bacterial counterpart, recent research shows it's &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-56743-8"&gt;sensitive to diet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2666-5247(22)00203-8"&gt;may affect our health&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-contain-a-variety-of-microbiomes-heres-a-look-at-a-few-of-the-most-important"&gt;We Contain a Variety of Microbiomes.

(Science Photo Library/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best studied mycobiome is the one in our &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.04.043"&gt;intestines&lt;/a&gt;. It's composed of many fungal species. The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2024.2399360"&gt;most common fungal species&lt;/a&gt; found there, particularly in the Western world, belong to the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560624/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; family&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; are a type of yeast. For most of us, the &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; population in our mycobiome is kept in check by our &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26053625/"&gt;immune system and our gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. But changes to either of these can cause &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/21505594.2016.1247140"&gt;populations of &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to expand in the mycobiome. This can be a problem, because &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; may cause &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-022-00826-w"&gt;life-threatening infections&lt;/a&gt; in people with damaged immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, research found that hospital patients who are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000000746"&gt;given antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; are more likely to develop &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is partly explained by the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2011.07.015"&gt;effect of antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;, which kill off certain species of gut bacteria that compete with &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; for space and resources within the intestine. Antibiotics have also been found to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2022.04.013"&gt;directly alter our immune cells&lt;/a&gt; and how they fight fungal infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another study, which analyzed the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-019-0709-7"&gt;mycobiome of cancer patients&lt;/a&gt;, found that those who developed serious &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; infections had an overgrowth of the fungus in their mycobiome just before the infection started. Combined with the damaging effects of chemotherapy on the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00210-023-02781-2"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;, this made it harder for patients to fight off the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disruption in the mycobiome's &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; balance has also been linked to several other diseases. For instance, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.01361-14"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; levels are high&lt;/a&gt; in patients who are critically ill. This suggests that too much Candida in our guts is a sign of poor health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in the fungal mycobiome have also been linked to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/17562848211047130"&gt;several gut diseases&lt;/a&gt;, including inflammatory bowel disease. Research on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04502-w"&gt;Crohn's disease&lt;/a&gt; has also shown that patients have an overgrowth of &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt;. These fungi also produce toxins that irritate the gut lining, which could potentially explain some of the symptoms Crohn's patients experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High levels of &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; in the gut can activate immune cells as well, making them more inflammatory. This has been seen in patients with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41590-023-01637-4"&gt;severe COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mycobiomes in the body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mycobiome isn't only found in our gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also have a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/21505594.2016.1249093"&gt;skin mycobiome&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, the skin &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature12171"&gt;between our toes&lt;/a&gt; contains a more diverse number of fungal species than any other skin mycobiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37703811/"&gt;skin mycobiome&lt;/a&gt; is mostly dominated by a fungus called &lt;em&gt;Malassezia&lt;/em&gt;. This yeast has adapted to grow on the skin's surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Malassezia&lt;/em&gt; can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/21505594.2016.1249093"&gt;activate the immune cells&lt;/a&gt; that reside between the skin's layers. This may lead to inflammation linked to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaad.2008.07.058"&gt;skin disorders&lt;/a&gt;, such as psoriasis and eczema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178397" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178397" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/IllustrationOfPsoriasisExcessiveSkinCellGrowthFormingPlaques.jpg" alt="illustration of excessive skin cell growth in psoriasis forming plaques" class="wp-image-178397 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/IllustrationOfPsoriasisExcessiveSkinCellGrowthFormingPlaques.jpg 727w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/IllustrationOfPsoriasisExcessiveSkinCellGrowthFormingPlaques-642x424.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/IllustrationOfPsoriasisExcessiveSkinCellGrowthFormingPlaques-600x396.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178397" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Psoriasis is a skin condition where excessive growth of skin cells can lead to itchy, scaly, thickened patches (plaques) of skin which may become infected. (Nemes Laszlo/Science Photo Library/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida auris&lt;/em&gt; is also a cause for concern. This fungus is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2666-5247(23)00114-3"&gt;resistant to many antifungal drugs&lt;/a&gt;, which is why it can be a problem if it grows on the skin's surface. In a hospital or emergency room, this could be dangerous – particularly to patients who have immune system problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women also have a mycobiome within the vagina. Its balance with the bacterial communities living there can be a big determinant for vaginal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(18)30103-8"&gt;most common fungal infections&lt;/a&gt; globally is vaginal candidiasis (thrush). It can &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/common-symptoms/thrush"&gt;cause symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as intense itching, pain and swelling. Many adult women will experience at least one thrush infection in their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source of thrush is another fungus from the Candida family: &lt;em&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/em&gt;. This is a common member of the vaginal mycobiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1002611107"&gt;vagina's microbiome&lt;/a&gt; is normally dominated by the bacteria &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; which help keep &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; populations in check. But if the balance between bacteria and fungi gets disrupted (for example, by antibiotics), the fungus can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-020-01464-4"&gt;overgrow or produce inflammatory molecules&lt;/a&gt; within the vagina. This inflammatory response is responsible for common thrush symptoms such as redness and itching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probiotics may help to restore the balance between fungi and bacteria to prevent vaginal yeast infections – although this has had &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/femsre/fuaf013"&gt;limited success so far&lt;/a&gt;. Some &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.adi3363"&gt;new treatments&lt;/a&gt; that target inflammation-causing fungal molecules have shown promise in animal models and in small numbers of women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's good evidence to suggest we might also have a mycobiome in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s2213-2600(18)30510-1"&gt;lungs&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fgb.2019.03.008"&gt;breastmilk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Controversially, some have even suggested that we may have small numbers of fungal cells in the brain – and these fungal cells may be linked with neurodegenerative disorders such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.42257"&gt;Parkinsons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/srep15015"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2018.00159"&gt;Autopsy studies&lt;/a&gt; have found evidence of fungi in the brains of people who died from brain disorders – but this doesn't prove the fungi caused their illness or that it was there during their life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/pdf/S2211-1247(23)01252-4.pdf"&gt;Experimental studies in mice&lt;/a&gt; have also shown that small numbers of fungal cells can survive in the brain for long periods of time – and the presence of these fungal cells was linked with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-07991-4"&gt;reduced memory function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003020"&gt;Experiments in flies&lt;/a&gt; have also shown fungi may travel to the brain and affect function. This is the best evidence we currently have showing small numbers of fungi may get into the brain and survive long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether this occurs in people, and if this would be considered a true mycobiome, remains to be proven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's still much we don't know about the mycobiome. But with continued research in this area we may soon better understand the mycobiome's importance in our health and how we can nurture and care for it.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264545/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

It persists not for lack of science or solutions, but because leaders have failed to act with the urgency and commitment the crisis demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A consortium of more than 50 partners, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), is responding to these outbreaks through the &lt;a href="https://www.gtfcc.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Global Task Force on Cholera Control&lt;/a&gt;– a partnership established in 1992 to enable access to essential supplies, as well as work on the detection, prevention and treatment of cholera and set global priorities to sustainably control the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Complementing the work of the taskforce, in August the WHO and the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; Centres for Disease Control and Prevention launched a continental cholera emergency response plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="8b6c02be-b19e-4970-9fc8-43b3873fb026" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":5,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Sudan cholera outbreak kills 40 in a week as health centres overwhelmed","elementId":"8b6c02be-b19e-4970-9fc8-43b3873fb026","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/aug/14/sudan-cholera-outbreak-water-health-medecins-sans-frontieres-msf-war-refugees"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":8,"display":0,"theme":1}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cholera is caused by a bacterium ingested in food or water contaminated with faeces from an infected person, and the only way to prevent it is by ensuring access to safe water and sanitation. This is why it is now practically unheard of in countries with those facilities, but thrives in communities afflicted by inequality, poverty, conflict, displacement and climate-related disasters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The disease can be prevented with effective vaccines. An injectable vaccine was first developed in the late 19th century, and was superseded by oral vaccines in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But because the disease afflicts almost exclusively the poorest countries and communities, the vaccine does not attract investment from developers, for whom it offers little market opportunity. There is currently only one manufacturer producing cholera vaccines at the scale needed for mass vaccination campaigns: EUBiologics, based in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;To manage cholera outbreaks, the WHO and other partners established a global &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/groups/icg/cholera/stockpiles" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cholera vaccine stockpile&lt;/a&gt; for outbreaks in 2013 under the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision (ICG) to ensure rapid, equitable and effective access to vaccines in emergencies, especially in low-resource settings. Since then, the stockpile has distributed almost 255m doses of vaccine to 34 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Almost 75% of those doses have been distributed since 2021, in response to the global resurgence of cholera. So far this year, the stockpile has disbursed more than 49m vaccine doses – already eclipsing the previous record for a single year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Given the increasing frequency and severity of outbreaks, vaccines from the stockpile can only be used to bring outbreaks under control, rather than to conduct preventive campaigns in areas at risk of cholera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The stockpile is replenished every week but production cannot keep up with demand, and it is regularly below the &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/everything-you-need-know-about-global-emergency-vaccine-stockpiles" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommended threshold&lt;/a&gt; of having 5m doses ready to respond to outbreaks at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;To stretch supplies further, the ICG suspended the standard two-dose vaccination regimen in 2022 in favour of a single dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-14" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-rsfwa"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;Global Dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"global-dispatch","successDescription":"Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Single-dose vaccination is only therefore a temporary solution to scarce supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Demand shows no sign of abating, meaning supply must increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In October 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/zambia" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Zambia&lt;/a&gt; signed a memorandum of understanding with China’s Jijia Medical Technology Company to establish a cholera vaccine-production facility in Lusaka. The planned production will still require rigorous quality assurance and clinical trials to confirm safety and efficacy before any locally manufactured doses can be approved by the WHO and deployed in mass vaccination campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While expanding vaccine production in Africa is essential for preventing and responding to outbreaks of this historical disease, the only long-term solution is for governments to invest in safe drinking water and sanitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There are some diseases that cannot be completely prevented, such as Alzheimer’s and most cancers. But cholera is not one of them – it can be stopped. Cholera persists because poverty, inequality, conflict and displacement persist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Stopping it is therefore not a scientific, medical or technical challenge; fundamentally, it’s a political one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 13:38:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxQNDZVMmVrdS1LWkNudG1oSkZNTTFibjBjcUM1VlYtbVloOTN0RU5iR242QzRyTi04ZHA0aHByYjNWWEhQT1pELTZBOS16QUNiZHRVbENBZ2JlQXRQeHdjb1dZM0Y3RXZBNDRHdkdMSExUSkEwV0FCQ1NSenR5NjUyNVJvZEpNb2oyN0VLeVlvSHhPMFRLZE11clRySnhtN1V4ZWdELVBDWU9nbElVaG5QZnMtRQ</guid></item><item><title>在刷牙之前或之后，您应该用牙线清洁牙齿吗？牙医揭示正确的技术- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/floss-teeth-brush-them-dentists-103200640.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Should You Floss Your Teeth Before You Brush?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;PeopleImages - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know you should brush teeth twice and floss once a day at a minimum to keep your teeth clean and breath fresh. But it turns out those two things may make a difference in both the cleanliness of your mouth and the health of your whole body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition to protecting your smile, maintaining excellent oral hygiene contributes to better overall health,” says &lt;a href="https://www.aae.org/patients/directory/people/steven-j-katz/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Steven J. Katz, DDS, MS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Steven J. Katz, DDS, MS&lt;/a&gt;, the president of the American Association of Endodontists. &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(23)00755-6/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research has shown;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research has shown&lt;/a&gt; that people who take care of their teeth and gums also enjoy a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, improved control of diabetes, and even &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2025/25_0083.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:better cognitive health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;better cognitive health&lt;/a&gt; as they age.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure you’re taking the best possible care of your teeth so you can reap those potential health benefits, you may want to rethink your dental care routine. We reached out to two dentists to find out if it makes a difference whether you brush your teeth first and floss after, or floss first and brush after. Apparently it does!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do we need to floss our teeth?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flossing entails sticking something thin (usually a special string) between your teeth and moving it around to help dislodge any matter that shouldn’t be there, which supports the health of our entire mouth. “Flossing is a simple yet crucial step in maintaining oral health, as it removes debris and plaque from areas your toothbrush can’t reach,” says &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aspendental.com%2Fproviders%2Fashley-boling%2F1265743710%2F&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhealth%2Fwellness%2Fa69000438%2Fshould-you-floss-your-teeth-before-or-after-you-brush%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ashley Boling, DDS/DMD;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ashley Boling, DDS/DMD&lt;/a&gt;, a dentist and the owner of an Aspen Dental practice in Hixon, Tennessee. “This &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7375740/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reduces the risk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reduces the risk&lt;/a&gt; of cavities, gum disease and other dental issues.” As noted above, those dental problems can also put you at risk for additional whole-body health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should you floss before or after brushing your teeth?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might sound counterintuitive to put floss between teeth that you know are still dirty, but &lt;strong&gt;it’s best to floss first and brush second.&lt;/strong&gt; “Flossing first removes food particles and plaque from between the teeth — areas that a toothbrush simply can’t reach,” says Katz. &lt;strong&gt;“Clearing out those spaces not only reduces the risk of cavities and gum disease, but also allows the fluoride in your toothpaste to reach more surfaces of your teeth.&lt;/strong&gt; That means &lt;a href="https://www.ada.org/resources/community-initiatives/fluoride-in-water/fluoridation-faqs" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stronger enamel;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;stronger enamel&lt;/a&gt;, healthier gums, and better protection against decay.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boling agrees. “You can floss before or after brushing as long as you are doing it thoroughly and are reaching areas that your toothbrush can’t,” she says. &lt;strong&gt;“Flossing beforehand, however, can help dislodge food particles and plaque, making brushing more effective.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When is the best time of day to floss?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best time to floss your teeth is the time that you will stick to every day. “For many people, &lt;strong&gt;the easiest habit is to floss at night before brushing and right before bed,” says Katz. “That way, you go to sleep with a clean, healthy mouth.&lt;/strong&gt; Once flossing becomes part of your nightly routine, you’ll quickly notice that it feels incomplete when you skip it — almost like forgetting to wash your face or lock the door.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the best flossing tool?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I find &lt;strong&gt;traditional string floss to be the most effective for scraping plaque from beneath the gumline, but tools like floss picks and water flossers are great alternatives,&lt;/strong&gt; especially for those with dexterity challenges or braces,” says Boling. “The key is consistency — the best flossing tool is the one you’ll use regularly!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pro 1000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003UKM9CO?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10055.a.69000438%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$39.94 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$39.94 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4100 Power Toothbrush&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09LD7WRVS?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10055.a.69000438%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$39.99 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$39.99 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9900 Prestige Rechargeable Electric Power Toothbrush with SenseIQ&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08YCVJKXV?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10055.a.69000438%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$349.99 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$349.99 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consistent brushing and flossing, combined with regular dental visits, are the best way to maintain strong oral health and avoid complex dental procedures,” says Katz.

My father died of colon cancer back in 1999. His brother and sister both died of colon cancer too, so this is a big concern in our family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SH5V53MGWNHDNLVNYVBGWXHVRY"&gt;After my father died, I read up on things that might possibly reduce this disease. Aspirin was one, so for 15 years, I took coated aspirin every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5E4SU4O3F5GVXDXOG6OUU6R7KE"&gt;This past spring, I was admitted to a hospital because I needed a number of tests. One was a colonoscopy. Naturally, the doctors who heard about my family history of colon cancer expected the worst. We were all surprised by the results. My colon had no cancer or even any polyps. I believe that taking aspirin for years might have protected me from this disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WSSY54KIQ5GMLEZEBKP557AWTM"&gt;A. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine (Dec. 5, 1991) concluded that “Regular aspirin use at low doses may reduce the risk of fatal colon cancer.” A new study from Sweden confirms that aspirin may help prevent colorectal cancer in people with a genetic susceptibility (New England Journal of Medicine, Sept. 18, 2025). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HFLLKLJTVBARTK56BXRB6ZPRPY"&gt;Anyone who plans to take aspirin on a regular basis needs medical supervision.

Do you have more details about the use of testosterone replacement in men? My understanding is that a relatively recent large-scale study showed that men using testosterone replacement therapy did not have more cardiovascular risks. That has long been the concern of the medical community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PBUUUVZPLJFLRKOHWWZ24X3DEE"&gt;A. Earlier this year, the Food and Drug Administration revised the required labeling for testosterone products prescribed for men with low hormone levels. The agency said drug companies should remove the Boxed Warning about adverse cardiovascular outcomes from their testosterone labels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FAJ5RTRNFZAORMHODH5BS7M3IA"&gt;This is based on the outcomes of the TRAVERSE study (New England Journal of Medicine, June 16, 2023).

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5byblv000x26p5946d2zkw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lead shouldn’t be in your food, right?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5bzrgp00083b6nnhjx8ahb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Exposure to the substance has been linked to a wide range of health impacts, including developmental problems, nervous system damage and hearing problems in children; and high blood pressure, joint pain and reproductive problems in adults.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5bzrgp00093b6n7qi572xg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the same time, reports continue to document high levels of lead in food products such as &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/health/lead-cinnamon-powder-spices-wellness"&gt;applesauce&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/06/health/cinnamon-applesauce-lead-fda"&gt;cinnamon powder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/09/health/protein-powder-heavy-metals-wellness"&gt;protein powder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/31/health/cacao-dark-chocolate-lead-heavy-metals-wellness"&gt;chocolate&lt;/a&gt;. This year, the US Food and Drug Administration established new guidance on limits of lead content in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/06/health/lead-baby-food-fda-wellness"&gt;baby food&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5bzrgp000a3b6n6m8z26g8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It makes sense to ask: Why would there be lead in your diet at all?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5bzrgp000b3b6nlasen1i4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lead is a naturally occurring metal found in our planet, and it has been used in products such as gasoline, paint, plumbing, cosmetics, ceramics and batteries, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/lead" target="_blank"&gt;National Institute of Environmental Health Science.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5bzrgp000d3b6n6ruw1qpi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Often, lead in food comes from the soil. “The most common reason is because lead, like other metals and heavy metals, is a naturally occurring part of the earth and the Earth’s crust,” said Dr. Joseph Zagorski, a toxicologist and assistant professor at Michigan State University’s Center for Research on Ingredient Safety.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5bzrgp000e3b6nvf1ymt37@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some plants are more prone to absorbing the lead in the soil and storing them in their own tissue, he added. If crops are grown in areas with higher levels of lead in the environment, they may contain more of the metal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5bzrgp000f3b6nkfv9s0sv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But not all the lead sources in the environment are natural, Zagorski said. Human activities such as smelting frequently lead to lead contamination, and there have been pesticides that contained lead, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5bzrgp000g3b6nzq74qs5a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Use of leaded gasoline can also lead to contamination of plants through the air, said Dr. Tasha Stoiber, a senior scientist for the Environmental Working Group. Lead has been phased out of gasoline for cars, but is &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/30/business/lead-gasoline-car-climate-change-intl"&gt;still used&lt;/a&gt; in some fuel types.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5bzrgp000h3b6nnnv7z60p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Contamination also can occur through someone adding lead to food, as appeared to be &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/06/health/cinnamon-applesauce-lead-fda"&gt;the case in 2023&lt;/a&gt; with some applesauce pouches. But that is not usually the case.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5bzrgp000i3b6n78p346sc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because the heavy metal is found in the environment, people are unlikely to reach a point of zero lead exposure in our food or anywhere. However, lead –– even in small doses –– can have health impacts, Stoiber said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5bzrgp000j3b6nr1jnv2tk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For children, the concern is particularly great because their smaller bodies and metabolisms put them at a greater vulnerability for harms caused by exposure, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/environmental-contaminants-food/closer-zero-reducing-childhood-exposure-contaminants-foods" target="_blank"&gt;FDA.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5bzrgp000k3b6nv1e5nozb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The federal agency has been working to reduce dietary exposure to contaminants for children to as close to zero as possible. And no safe level of exposure to lead has been identified, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lead-prevention/php/news-features/updates-blood-lead-reference-value.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5bzrgp000l3b6n5gngssut@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35690180/" target="_blank"&gt;FDA does use a benchmark&lt;/a&gt; of 2.2 micrograms per day of dietary lead exposure for children and 8.8 micrograms per day for women of childbearing age. Experts use those numbers to evaluate when an exposure is potentially a concern and a product needs to be alerted.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5bzrgp000m3b6n3y4xir9h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The guidelines on dietary lead exposure are hard to translate into practical use at home, and you likely won’t know exactly how much is in the food you are eating, Stoiber said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5bzrgp000n3b6n1dagwvtp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She recommends looking into brands that regularly test their food products for lead levels. And your best defense against lead –– and any other toxin –– is a diverse, nutritionally dense diet, Zagorski said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5bzrgp000o3b6n11bexvtw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Eating a variety of foods can help in two ways. First, it reduces the likelihood that you are eating too much of one food that may be more likely to contain lead.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5bzrgp000p3b6nme5lm7c1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For example, earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/09/health/protein-powder-heavy-metals-wellness"&gt;a report found lead&lt;/a&gt; in protein powders. Occasional use of those protein powders isn’t as concerning as a person making protein shakes three times a day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5bzrgp000q3b6ntflm3vsk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Protein powder is intended to be a supplement and not a diet,” Zagorski said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5bzrgp000r3b6nelkccouc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Second, a nutrient-dense and varied diet also can help with your body’s natural defenses against unwanted elements, he added. Your body prefers absorbing iron over lead — so if you have enough iron in your diet, your digestive system is more likely to let the lead pass through, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5bzrgp000s3b6nab5v9hbp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The dose makes the poison,” Zagorski said. “Your body is very good at taking care of itself and getting rid of toxins, so (make) sure that we are giving it the tools it needs and not overconsuming one thing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

This treatment is a common approach doctors use to train the immune system to kill cancer. It does this by blocking a protein that tumor cells make to turn off immune cells, enabling the immune system to continue killing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, patients who received either the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy were more than twice as likely to be alive after three years compared with those who didn't receive either vaccine. Surprisingly, patients with tumors that don't typically respond well to immunotherapy also saw very strong benefits, with nearly fivefold improvement in three-year overall survival. This link between improved survival and receiving a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine remained strong even after we controlled for factors like disease severity and co-occurring conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the underlying mechanism, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E2q2tK8AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank" data-url="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E2q2tK8AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;we turned to animal models&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We found that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines act like an alarm, triggering the body's immune system to recognize and kill tumor cells and overcome the cancer's ability to turn off immune cells. When combined, vaccines and immune checkpoint inhibitors coordinate to unleash the full power of the immune system to kill cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="youtube-video youtube-facade" data-nosnippet="" id="_D_Iz9s9Y6k"&gt;

People receiving an immune checkpoint inhibitor will be randomized to either receive a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine during treatment or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="03558f35-9487-44d0-904f-6a34a842406c"&gt;This study will tell us whether COVID-19 mRNA vaccines should be included as part of the standard of care for patients receiving an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Ultimately, we hope that this approach will help many patients who are treated with immune therapy, and especially those who currently lack effective treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work exemplifies how a tool born from a global pandemic may provide a new weapon against cancer and rapidly extend the benefits of existing treatments to millions of patients. By harnessing a familiar vaccine in a new way, we hope to extend the lifesaving benefits of immunotherapy to cancer patients who were previously left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This edited article is republished from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://theconversation.com/" target="_blank" data-url="http://theconversation.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="26" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh5qa2nj00173b79bh3kenil@published"&gt;My parents are in their 70s and live around the corner. About once a week, we go to my parents’ house for family time and dinner.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh5qjqh100333b79c509rvqg@published"&gt;My daughter is almost 2 and has a pretty strict bedtime; it becomes more difficult to get her to sleep if she goes past it. Here’s the problem: No matter how hard I try, I can’t get my mom to get dinner on the table early enough for us to get home in time for bedtime!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="100" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh5segc000053b79lut1mtw2@published"&gt;I try to help her plan and make dinner, but even then, she’ll get out the ingredients and just wait before she starts cooking. She works full-time and has always been bad at coming home on time, so getting the whole evening together to start sooner is not possible. She blames &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; for not adjusting our schedule (i.e., not letting our daughter stay up later “just” one night a week or so). She has now declared that we just can’t come over for dinner anymore, which is sad to me. Do you have a recommendation for solving this frustrating problem?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="3" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh5qa2rt00193b79h262jyfw@published"&gt;—Routines Are Important!&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="2" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh5qa2tj001a3b79bb9tsav3@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Routines,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh5qa2vv001b3b79qmjw167n@published"&gt;I sympathize (very much) with your desire to keep your toddler’s bedtime at an hour that works best for getting her to go to sleep. (Indeed, I’m delighted for you that you have found the magic bullet for a stress-free bedtime! May it ever be so.) What you cannot do is make others, even your own mother, adhere to your schedule. This is unreasonable. (Yes, you are her daughter; you are also a guest in her house when you go over for dinner. Dinner guests do not get to dictate the time dinner will be served.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh5qa2xx001c3b79ze45d454@published"&gt;But your mother, too, is being unreasonable if she demands that you push back her granddaughter’s bedtime for her sake (thus making &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; life more difficult). My generous interpretation of her putting off the start of cooking is that she doesn’t want to miss that “family time” that occurs before dinner. Still: Why invite you to dinner, knowing that she won’t get said dinner on the table until an hour that’s too late for you?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh5qa30c001d3b79t5aa28ov@published"&gt;All of the above is why I am 99 percent certain this conflict isn’t actually about dinner, but about 1) who’s in charge;  2) your mother’s disapproval—I’m just guessing, but I’ll eat my hat if I’m wrong—of your adherence to a strict routine for your child; and 3) your wanting her to prove that she trusts and supports you in your role as a parent. (And probably some other stuff I don’t have enough information to guess at.)&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="161" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh5qa32e001e3b79xfac05yy@published"&gt;In any case, when it comes to the particular concrete issue you’re dealing with (if not the sources of it, which I recommend also dealing with, forthrightly), you have three choices, as I see it: You can invite your parents to your house for dinner once a week, making and serving the meal on your schedule; you can propose to your mother that instead of her cooking for your family once a week, she allow you to bring a meal—either home-cooked or picked up from a restaurant—over to her house, and that she further allow &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; to serve it, so that dinner will be had on time; or you can dispense with a weekly extended family dinner altogether and instead invite your parents to join you for another activity once a week or so, perhaps during the day on the weekend, at a time that is convenient for you and works with your daughter’s (also pretty strict, I imagine?) nap schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

This would require both you and your mom to be more flexible than either of you has so far been inclined to be—but perhaps this would be a good thing for all of you (including, in the long term, your daughter).&lt;/p&gt;

My kids range in age from upper elementary school to middle school. For years, I’ve watched families visit Disney World in the dead of winter to beat the long lines, or take advantage of lower airfare during nonpeak travel periods to head off somewhere warm. I’m envious. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/11/ask-teacher-vacation-absence.html"&gt;I’m a rule-follower and feel like school is school…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Pawel Wewiorski/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A research team from Puerto Rico carried out a literature review to compile findings on how menopause may reshape the brain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They reviewed studies published from 2020 to 2025 to get a better understanding of neuroanatomical changes during menopause. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The researchers identified consistent patterns that may help explain the changes in thinking, mood, and overall health that often occur during the menopause transition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The menopause transition can be a difficult part of a person’s life. &lt;a href="https://menopause.org/patient-education/menopause-topics/hot-flashes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Hot flashes&lt;/a&gt; are a common symptom, but the effects of hormonal changes can run much more deeply and affect everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team of the new literature review, affiliated with BRAVE Lab at Ponce Health Sciences University, noted patterns in brain changes caused by hormones that may help explain many menopause-related symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team will present their &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/GME.0000000000000002541" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; at the 2025 Annual Meeting of The Menopause Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering the impact menopause transition can have, especially throughout a decade or more of a woman’s life, the researchers of the new review wanted to review existing studies to see what links they could find between menopause and brain structure changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, they searched various databases for studies published within the past five years related to menopausal symptoms and brain structure. They focused on the most recent research and only included peer-reviewed studies in their review. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After going through the studies, the researchers compiled the links they found between menopause and brain structure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One pattern the review noted was that gray matter volume in the brain decreased. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gray matter is &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553239/#article-36416.s2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;significant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; in terms of day-to-day functioning, and a decrease in gray matter is associated with cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this may sound concerning, the researchers said some studies suggest that gray matter volume may partially recover in postmenopause. This indicates that the brain may adapt and reorganize itself over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The research team also noticed a pattern in findings related to menopause and white matter hyperintensities. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These spots can affect everyday thinking, memory, and mood, and may signal an increased vulnerability to certain neurological conditions over time. The hyperintensities were more pronounced in women who went through early menopause and who had &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3185243/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;frequent vasomotor symptoms&lt;/a&gt; (also known as hot flashes and include night sweats).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall, the findings suggest menopause may lead to measurable changes in brain structure, which may impact memory, thinking, and mood.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/faubion-stephanie-s-m-d-m-b-a/bio-20199366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Stephanie Faubion&lt;/a&gt;, MD, medical director for the Menopause Society, spoke with &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; about the review. She cautioned against becoming overly concerned about some of the links found between menopause and gray matter volume loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“While we know that menopause is related to some structural brain changes, we don’t have a clear understanding of whether these structural changes cause functional changes or cognitive decline,” said Faubion. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faubion added that women who experience forgetfulness or trouble concentrating during the menopause transition should not assume it signals something more serious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Indeed, there is no evidence that symptoms of ‘brain fog’ during the menopause transition are associated with later risk of dementia, which is reassuring,” Faubion pointed out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cleopatrarx.com/rhonda-r-voskuhl/#:~:text=Voskuhl%20sees%20menopausal%20women%20with,Back%20To%20Team" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Rhonda R. Voskuhl&lt;/a&gt;, MD, Professor of Neurology at UCLA and Inventor of CleopatraRX, also spoke with &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; about the review and discussed the importance of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) during menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Early treatment with estrogen for menopause is better than later treatment,” said Voskuhl. “Women are thought to become less responsive to estrogen treatment over the years.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voskuhl also touched on long-term cognitive concerns for women who experience brain fog during menopause. She pointed out that “not all menopausal women get Alzheimer’s disease,” but it does &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;affect women&lt;/a&gt; disproportionately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Loss of neuroprotective estrogen during menopause may contribute to susceptibility to getting Alzheimer’s disease 10 to 20 years later,” commented Voskuhl. She said that this would have to be further studied, including treating menopausal women with HRT to determine whether a “cause and effect relationship” exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hl-trusted-source source="World Health Organization" rationale="Highly respected international organization"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/menopause" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Menopause occurs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; when an individual hasn’t had a period for one full year, a signal that the ovaries have stopped producing most of their estrogen and progesterone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time leading up to menopause is called perimenopause, or the menopause transition, which can last for a decade or more. The average age of menopause is 51 to 52.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, some people may reach menopause earlier, and those who undergo treatment for certain cancers or have their ovaries removed will reach medical menopause without going through perimenopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this time, people experience physical and emotional changes resulting from shifting hormone levels. The symptoms of menopause can vary in intensity from mild to more disruptive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/hot-flash-causes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;hot flashes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;night sweats&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;irregular or missed periods (before they stop completely)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;mood swings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;fatigue and low energy &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another symptom that people report is brain fog or &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38888619/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;cognitive difficulties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;.

The answer is no. Magnesium and phosphorus are equally important,” says Dr Anil. He further highlights the importance of a holistic approach to bone health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Calcium provides strength to your bones, but &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/taking-magnesium-7-foods-and-drinks-that-may-reduce-its-effectiveness-101758736204448.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="magnesium"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; is crucial for calcium absorption and is found in foods like almonds and dry fruits. Phosphorus, present in eggs, chicken, lentils, and almonds, works alongside calcium to maintain bone structure,” explains Dr Raheja.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bones are living tissues that require a balance of nutrients to stay strong, flexible, and healthy. Relying solely on calcium &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/surgeon-warns-against-vitamin-d-supplements-too-much-can-backfire-and-damage-your-arteries-101761291956952.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="supplements"&gt;supplements&lt;/a&gt; is not enough.

Regular physical activity, weight-bearing exercises, and a lifestyle that supports overall wellness are equally important.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Dr Raheja sums up his advice with a simple mantra:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong bones need a balance of nutrients&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Calcium works best with the support of other minerals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthy bones = Better mobility and a more active life&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your bones support every move you make. Treat them well with the right nutrients, exercise, and lifestyle habits, and they’ll keep you moving strong for life,” Dr Raheja concludes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This report is based on user-generated content from social media.

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I noticed spikes in my blood sugar cause crashes and really impacted my mood. It changed how I started my day, because what I eat at 11 a.m. affects how I feel at 7 p.m.,” said Berardi, 43. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Continuous glucose monitors have become hugely popular and a billion-dollar business. While still a small percent of the overall market, the over-the-counter segment is nonetheless expected to grow to $2 billion by 2034, from $370 million in 2024, according to research firm  Global Market Insights. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Brand leaders such as Stelo from Dexcom and Lingo from Abbott are sold over the counter for adults not using insulin for about $80 each, or less with subscriptions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Devices typically last about 2 weeks, and a subscription can cover replacements as well as access to data and other analysis through a mobile app. Costs vary depending on the length of the subscription; Abbott, for example, advertises a 12-week Lingo plan for $249&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;New brands targeting weight-loss monitors, such as Signos, offer promotions that include a subscription, two devices, and the mobile app for $130 a month. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Yet despite their widespread use, researchers have only a limited understanding of how they might benefit people without diabetes. Proponents say the monitors can help people make healthier lifestyle choices. But some experts caution that without more thorough vetting, the data can be misinterpreted and should not be used as a replacement for the routine pre-diabetic screening doctors perform at annual exams. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;A new study from researchers at Mass General Brigham suggests that the usefulness of continuous glucose monitors in tracking blood sugar varies depending on a person’s level of diabetes risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The team examined how a lab test, hemoglobin A1c, which measures average blood sugar over several months, compared with eight different measures from glucose monitors, which record blood sugar levels every 5 minutes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Researchers analyzed data from nearly 1,000&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;adults ages 40 or older, including those with and without diabetes. The data was provided by patients who wore the G6 monitor from Dexcom. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Participants’ readings for type 2 diabetes closely matched their A1c test results. However, the correlation was weaker for people with prediabetes and those with normal blood sugar, even when researchers accounted for factors such as body mass index, according to the study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dr. Jorge Rodriguez, a co-author of the study, hypothesized that in people without diabetes, short glucose spikes from meals don’t last long enough to affect the three-month averages of an A1c test. But among diabetics, glucose levels stay elevated longer, so data recorded by the monitors align better with A1c tests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“As a physician, it is important to me to be able to advise all patients who may increasingly use these monitors,” said Rodriguez, an internal medicine hospitalist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. “In those without diabetes, [continuous glucose monitors] may be useful as behavioral ‘biofeedback’ tools that can provide insight into how food and activity impact real-time blood sugar levels, but they do not directly reflect longer-term blood sugar control.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The devices, which track blood sugar through a tiny sensor placed just beneath the skin, have helped people with type 1 diabetes prevent dangerous overnight drops and improve glucose control for those who rely on insulin. About 1 in 10 Americans has diabetes, and nearly half of those with Type 1 diabetes wear a continuous glucose monitor, according to the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Rodriguez said they launched the study last year as the FDA approved the first over-the-counter continuous glucose monitors. Around a half-dozen companies now market them, including Dexcom and Levels, which Trump’s Surgeon General co-founded. Rodriguez said there’s a need for more research into how well the devices predict someone’s risk of developing diabetes or dying of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“These tools could still be powerful at a personalized level and add value by seeing the impact of sugar, identifying it, and helping you make different choices... like what you chose to eat for lunch,” Rodriguez said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Sharam Fouladgar-Mercer, founder of Signos, a health platform promoted to non-diabetics, said the technology offers a glimpse into how bodies process energy and coaches people toward better health. Signos is the first over-the-counter continuous glucose monitoring system to be cleared by the FDA specifically for weight management.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“What works for one person doesn’t necessarily work for another, and the technology offered the only glimpse into how our bodies were processing the energy we intake,” said Fouladgar-Mercer, who said he was obese before using a glucose monitor. “We built a solution that helps people connect with what they eat, how they move, the way they feel with the data on the screen, so you don’t have to wait to see the number on the scale move.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Rodriguez said rapid changes in glucose could have downstream effects on hearts and kidneys, which is “normally seen in people with diabetes, but there’s a gap in understanding how it could impact those without diabetes. There’s still research to be done,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Berardi noticed that even modest periods of movement — walking after eating — made a measurable difference in her blood sugar.&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;But after acquiring what she called “enough insight,” she stopped using the device, citing the cost as a barrier. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Food is so powerful, and [glucose monitors] empower people to really see how it impacts all those biomarkers,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;According to the American Diabetes Association, normal blood glucose levels for an adult without diabetes are below 100 mg/dL when fasting and below 140 mg/dL two hours after meals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Rodriguez said he and his colleagues launched a separate study with around 10 participants to extend the findings and explore if people are changing their behaviors based on the readings of their continuous glucose monitors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dr. Samir Malkani, an endocrinologist and diabetes specialist at UMass Memorial Medical Center, called the use of blood-sugar monitors by non-diabetics “uncharted territory.”  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Why are we so worried about people who are in the normal range? The main advantage of monitors is to flag when things are out of range,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Berardi is glad she tried&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the device and thinks more people will start using continuous glucose monitors to track their wellness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I’m happy I did because this is a proactive approach to good metabolic health, versus the reactive, symptomatic approach that I think we’re so used to,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

While heart disease is not reversible, and is fairly progressive, it is entirely preventable and manageable (if detected early). Dr Evan Levine, a board certified cardiologist in US, lists out few tell-tale signs of heart disease that no one should ignore, even if they are otherwise ‘healthy.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Chest pressure and shortness of breath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Levine identifies chest pressure as a primary indicator, which people experience when they have coronary artery disease. People who have coronary artery disease experience chest pressure which they describe as tightness, heaviness, squeezing, or pressing sensation in their chest region, mostly described as “an elephant sitting on the chest.” According to Dr Levine, it could occur anytime, such as ‘walking, shoveling, or even at rest.’ Dr. Levine states that heart muscle blood flow reduction produces this chest pressure, which requires immediate medical attention. This pressure, says Dr Levine, can even radiate to the arms, shoulder, and jaw. Even though it is more common in the left side of the body, Dr Levine says it “can occur in both arms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Chest pain is the only sign of heart attack - Myth of Fact? Expert explains&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another symptom that patients with coronary artery disease experience is shortness of breath (different from chest pressure). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This occurs, because the heart requires oxygen-rich blood to function properly, but narrowed arteries in CAD patients restrict blood flow, which results in breathing difficulties, during physical activity. Dr. Levine explains that CAD can cause shortness of breath, even when chest pain is absent, particularly among patients who have high blood pressure or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fatigue, nausea, and heartburn in women&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Levine explains that women with coronary artery disease tend to experience slightly different symptoms than men do. Women with coronary artery disease experience different symptoms than men because they develop atypical signs, which includes fatigue and nausea and heartburn symptoms. The symptoms often lead doctors to miss the correct diagnosis, because they resemble other less severe medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who have coronary artery disease experience fatigue which causes them to feel extremely tired or exhausted, after doing minimal physical work. This occurs because heart muscle fails to receive sufficient blood flow, which produces nausea and heartburn symptoms that resemble gastrointestinal problems. Dr. Levine warns women to seek medical help when they experience consistent heartburn symptoms, because these could indicate CAD, when combined with other warning signs or risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why awareness matters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Levine emphasises that prompt identification of these symptoms becomes essential because coronary artery disease advances without noticeable symptoms, until it results in heart attack or heart failure. Women and other patients need to understand all possible heart disease symptoms because they do not always experience the typical chest pain symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who experience unexplained chest pressure, shortness of breath or unusual fatigue, nausea or heartburn, should immediately visit a doctor for medical evaluation. The prompt diagnosis and treatment of heart conditions, leads to better patient results and helps prevent dangerous heart-related complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Prevention of Heart Disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development of coronary artery disease results from plaque accumulation in arteries, which stems from unhealthy lifestyle choices. Dr. Levine and other heart health experts, provide multiple essential methods which help people prevent heart disease. They are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Healthy diet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A heart-healthy diet serves as the base for all heart health initiatives. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean proteins helps people lower their cholesterol levels, and reduce inflammation in their bodies. The Mediterranean diet and DASH diet, serve as two evidence-based eating plans, which focus on plant-based foods and olive oil as their main components. People should restrict their consumption of saturated fats, trans fats, excessive sugar and salt, because these substances raise blood pressure and damage arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Exercise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical exercise at least 150 minutes per week through moderate activities like walking, swimming or cycling helps build heart strength and improves blood flow, while maintaining weight at a healthy level. Regular exercise helps people lower their risk for developing high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity, which are all factors that increase the risk of coronary artery disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Quitting smoking&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quitting smoking stands as the most important step, because tobacco consumption causes blood vessel damage and accelerates plaque formation. The exposure to secondhand smoke, creates an increased risk for developing cardiovascular diseases.
