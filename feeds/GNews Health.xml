    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7cizg005826p1fezy5mp0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Centers and Disease Control and Prevention is considering recommending annual Covid-19 shots to those who are older or who have compromised immune function, rather than the current blanket recommendation for everyone 6 months of age and older.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay00042e6be4kk0eoi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The change would more closely align the US with guidance given in other countries. Unlike countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, the US alone recommends an annual Covid-19 vaccine for healthy younger adults and children. The World Health Organization also doesn’t routinely recommend annual Covid-19 vaccines for healthy adults under 65 or healthy children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay00052e6b91759y1i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Monday, a panel of independent experts that advises the CDC on its vaccine recommendations, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, weighed the pros and cons of moving the US away from a blanket recommendation that most people get an updated Covid-19 shot every year and toward a more nuanced, risk-based recommendation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay00062e6buvwmb2aj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Members of the Covid-19 vaccine work group said they began studying the policy change in November.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay00072e6bjmqxbakc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Under a risk-based recommendation, the CDC would continue to recommend two doses of Covid-19 vaccines each year for older adults — those over 65 — and to anyone with weakened immune function.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay00082e6b84kr6x6p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It may also consider recommending annual vaccination for adults and children who are at high risk of Covid-19 disease because they have a higher risk of being exposed to it. Those groups could include people like health-care workers or children in day care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay00092e6bh19oyn32@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There was also strong support for a statement in the recommendation to say that anyone who wanted to get a Covid-19 vaccine could still get one, even if they didn’t fit into a higher-risk category.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000a2e6bh79jsqhk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A risk-based recommendation would be more complicated to communicate to the public and potentially trickier to implement than a universal recommendation, and some members of the full committee said they’d be against it for that reason.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000b2e6bjzum7ftd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I guess I’m surprised that we’re considering a risk-based recommendation, which in general, we have not had a lot of success with implementing in the US,” said committee member Dr. Denise Jamieson, dean of the Carver College of Medicine at the University of Iowa.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000c2e6b2jnrtsrk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Jamieson said she also worried that some people could lose insurance coverage for their Covid-19 vaccines if the recommendation was softened for some groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000d2e6bdrw806ne@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s also not clear where the committee might land on underlying health conditions and who would be considered at higher risk based on a pre-existing condition, such as diabetes or heart or lung diseases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000e2e6bliy3xva2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An analysis of data based on the CDC’s list of conditions that increase the risk for severe disease from a Covid-19 infection found that 74% of adults have at least one health condition that puts them at risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000f2e6b12xb8spn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And even though Covid is no longer causing the same kind of punishing waves of illness and death as it once did, it was still the 10th leading cause of death among adults in 2023. From September 2023 through August 2024, it caused roughly 40,000 deaths in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000g2e6b1b4d8h70@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Covid is still a fairly dangerous disease and very, very common,” said committee member Dr. Jamie Loehr, who runs a family practice clinic in Ithaca, New York.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000h2e6b4k3tet51@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Loehr said he wondered how feasible it might be to implement a risk-based recommendation and what message it might send to the public.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000i2e6bjamg61vr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Even though I’m in favor of a risk-based recommendation, I still have my hesitations,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000j2e6bbhzepv52@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Others worried that exempting healthy adults might make long Covid more common. Studies have shown that vaccination cuts the risk of developing the condition, which affected more than 9 million adults and children in 2023, according to national surveys.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000k2e6bikp42vvn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What I would like to see is modeling around long Covid,” said committee member Dr. Oliver Brooks, the chief medical officer of Watts Healthcare Corp. in Los Angeles. “My primary concern through all of this at this point is long Covid.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000l2e6b38reoyvn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Though there was concern that risk-based recommendations would decrease vaccination, others pointed out there’s no proof that’s true.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000m2e6b8kawxjmo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s not clear evidence at all that risk-based approaches are less effective,” said committee member Dr. Noel Brewer, a professor of public health at the University of North Carolina. “The data supporting that claim are not really there.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000n2e6bay3qjhbl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On the whole, members of the committee who have studied the question most closely said they favored switching to risk-based recommendations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k7dxay000o2e6bmne0cvun@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As of April, more than three-quarters of the working group on the Covid-19 vaccine recommendations for this coming fall and winter favored risk-based recommendations, though they don’t plan to formally vote on the policy change until the next meeting, which is scheduled for June.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

                The CDC's Division of Viral Hepatitis was shuttered amid federal layoffs in April.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;After people started testing positive for hepatitis C in a coastal Florida town in December, state officials collected blood from patients, wrapped their specimens in dry ice and mailed them straight to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, Ga.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The hepatitis C virus, which is spread through contact with infected blood and can lead to deadly liver cancer, is notoriously hard to identify. But if anyone could understand what was happening in Florida, it would be the Division of Viral Hepatitis in the CDC's headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Using samples from the laboratory's collection of nearly 1 million frozen specimens, scientists helped make the initial discovery of the hepatitis C virus in the 1980s. In 2020, that research was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The scientists at the lab knew what they were doing. Quickly, they analyzed the blood from Florida using their custom software and found that nine cases were genetically linked to the same pain clinic, where it was later discovered that a doctor was improperly reusing injection vials. By March, officials in Florida had restricted the doctor's medical license to limit the spread of the virus and packaged new patient samples to send to the CDC for testing, CDC employees told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But on April 1, the outbreak investigation was brought to a halt. All 27 of the lab's scientists received an email from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services informing them that they were losing their jobs. Like &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/01/g-s1-57485/hhs-fda-layoffs-doge-cdc-nih" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;thousands of other employees&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who received similar emails that day, the scientists were told they would be placed on administrative leave until June 2, after which they would no longer work for the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The email said their duties were "identified as either unnecessary or virtually identical to duties being performed elsewhere in the agency." But the kind of genetic tracing that the CDC's lab performs is not conducted by any other lab in the United States or the world, experts interviewed by NPR said. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the lab remains shuttered, ongoing investigations of current hepatitis outbreaks have been stalled, not just in Florida, but also in Oregon, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Wisconsin, West Virginia and Georgia, according to CDC employees who work closely with the Division of Viral Hepatitis. The five CDC employees NPR spoke with requested that their names not be shared for fear of retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Scientists who specialize in infectious disease told NPR that the lab's closure puts Americans at a higher risk of contracting viral infections in the future.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"More people get sick, or you don't recognize outbreaks at all, and they just continue to spread unchecked," said the Director of Infectious Disease Programs at the Association of Public Health Laboratories, Kelly Wroblewski. "That's the ultimate risk."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Although four new samples have already arrived at the lab and three more were waiting in Florida to be sent, none have been tested by the CDC, scientists at the CDC said. Epidemiologists still working at the CDC have been trying to find another place that can do the analysis but have been unsuccessful, an agency employee told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Commercial laboratories do not do this because it's not profitable," said the employee. "That's why no one really does it except for us."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Without the CDC's scientists available to test the genetic material in patient samples, it will be harder for epidemiologists to confirm whether people with hepatitis C were infected in the same Florida doctor's office or somewhere else where the virus could still be spreading, CDC scientists said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We won't know whether there are other linked cases in this clinic," said a CDC scientist. "There could potentially be hundreds more people that have been infected with hepatitis C and not know it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR requested an interview with the Florida Department of Health but representatives there did not respond. When NPR reached out to the CDC to request an interview to discuss the status of the Division of Viral Hepatitis lab, a representative referred reporters to an HHS form for requesting comment. As of publication, HHS has not responded to six questions NPR asked through the form.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Two days after the lab's scientists received their reduction in force emails, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. acknowledged that about a fifth of the cuts at HHS &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/05/g-s1-58312/hhs-layoffs-rif-cdc-fda-nih" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;were made unintentionally&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and some people would be offered their jobs back.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We're reinstating them," Kennedy told reporters on April 3. "We're going to do 80 percent cuts, but 20 percent of those are going to have to be reinstalled, because we'll make mistakes."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;On April 4, the Association of Public Health Laboratories sent a letter to Kennedy urging HHS to reinstate all personnel in the Division of Viral Hepatitis and at the Division of STD Prevention, another lab at the CDC that was also shuttered.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The [Division of Viral Hepatitis] Laboratory Branch had the highest degree of viral hepatitis expertise of any public health laboratory in the world," wrote Scott Becker, the association's CEO. "Their loss eliminated critical national testing services that do not exist anywhere else within the HHS agencies."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As of April 16, the association had not received a response from Kennedy, Becker said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-60574" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver, most often caused by one of five different viruses. The disease sickens and kills tens of thousands of Americans every year. In 2022, there were more than 85,000 estimated viral hepatitis infections in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, the latest &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-surveillance-2022/about/index.html#cdc_survey_profile_key_findings-key-findings" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;surveillance data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows. More than 14,500 people are known to have died from the infections in 2022. That number does not include patients who might have died from related complications, like long-term liver disease, without knowing the cause could have been a hepatitis infection.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Viral hepatitis is often undiagnosed and underreported. For more than 30 years, the Division of Viral Hepatitis has been trying to change that, scientists said. Hepatitis samples in the lab's collection in the CDC's headquarters have been used by scientists to invent multiple vaccines and identify new viral strains. The lab's scientists have linked thousands of infections to their sources, they said, which likely prevented dozens of outbreaks from affecting far more members of the public.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because of the unique role that U.S. government labs like the Division of Viral Hepatitis play in disease detection and prevention, they rarely shut down. If a single scientist is expected to leave or retire, the lab creates an elaborate plan to transition their work to someone else who can continue it, said a CDC scientist. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But after employees were told their jobs were no longer needed on April 1, they were also informed they had just one day to close down the lab, scientists at the lab told NPR. Relocating around a million samples in a day would be virtually impossible, the scientists said. The samples are kept in more than 50 freezers maintained at different temperatures, ranging from -80 degrees to -20 degrees. Since the lab has no other freezer space outside the CDC where they could transfer the specimens, they're still at the CDC for now, scientists said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Nothing has been shut down correctly," said a CDC employee. "These aren't pieces of equipment you can just unplug."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The lab's computer genomic analysis program – called the Global Hepatitis Outbreak and Surveillance Technology, or GHOST – is also in limbo. That's the program that allowed scientists to link the genetic information from patients in Florida to the doctor's office where the infections spread. More than 20 other states access the CDC's GHOST technology remotely by uploading their own samples directly to the program. But the system, which was built with help from a more than $6 million dollar allocation from Congress, is not fully remote. To function correctly, and to allow the program to keep improving itself with artificial intelligence, it requires frequent in-person maintenance by scientists working at high-end computer stations located at the CDC, said four CDC employees who work with the technology.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If we don't have the experts behind it, we're not going to be able to use it," said a health worker at the CDC involved with the Florida outbreak investigation. "Something will happen and it will glitch and it will go down. If this happens, it's going to take decades to come back from that, and that's devastating not just to us, but to the American people."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Scientists have been trying to go into the lab to prevent the GHOST program from shutting down, CDC employees told NPR, even though their jobs have not been reinstated. But communication about access to the lab has been inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Shortly after they were told to pack up their materials in one day, the scientists were informed that they could keep entering the lab through April 11. A few returned to find some of the lab's equipment already malfunctioning. Soon after, the scientists heard they could retain access to the lab through April 25. But that access has not always been granted immediately. Multiple scientists who tried to enter CDC headquarters on April 14 were initially turned away due to issues with their key cards, two CDC employees told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Expensive equipment and irreplaceable specimens could be permanently lost if scientists cannot keep working in the lab, CDC employees said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You have to do certain things to make sure they're set up for long-term pauses," said a CDC scientist. "That's millions of dollars worth of equipment if they're not shut down correctly."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When functioning properly, the lab can also respond to unexpected public health emergencies. For almost a year, starting in April 2020, the Division of Viral Hepatitis tested specimens from people infected with the novel COVID-19 virus to better understand it. The lab generated some of the first data on the prevalence of COVID-19 across the U.S., workers told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We were there during the pandemic when everyone was afraid and we didn't know anything about COVID," said one CDC scientist. "And now we're thrown out, just like that."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In interviews with NPR, four scientists who worked in the lab said they and their colleagues are hoping they'll be able to return to keep doing their work at the Division of Viral Hepatitis, which they said saves American lives.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Everyone is saying that this seems to be a mistake," said a CDC scientist. "If they knew the impact of these programs, they would never do this."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="hr"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you have information about health projects that have been halted or any other story tips, you can send an email to the reporter of this article at eisnerchiara@proton.me.

          &lt;p&gt;In now-rarified comments from experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency official on Tuesday evening said the explosive measles outbreak mushrooming out of West Texas will require "significant financial resources" to control and that the agency is already struggling to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are scrapping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions," said David Sugerman, the CDC's lead on its measles team. The agency has been devastated by &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/rfk-jr-s-bloodbath-at-hhs-blowback-grows-as-losses-become-clearer/"&gt;brutal cuts to CDC staff&lt;/a&gt; and funding, including &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/cdc-rocked-by-top-level-departures-loss-of-11-4b-in-covid-funding/"&gt;a clawback of more than $11 billion&lt;/a&gt; in public health funds that largely went to state health departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sugerman noted that the response to measles outbreaks is generally expensive. "The estimates are that each measles cases can be $30,000 to $50,000 for public health response work—and that adds up quite quickly." The costs go to various responses, including on-the-ground response teams, vaccine doses and vaccination clinics, case reporting, contact tracing, mitigation plans, infection prevention, data systems, and other technical assistance to state health departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, the CDC would provide media briefings and other public comments on the responses to such an extraordinarily large and fast-moving outbreak. However, Sugerman's comments are among the first publicly made by CDC experts under the current administration. He spoke about the outbreak at the very end of an all-day, public meeting of the agency's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which discussed a broad range of vaccine and vaccine-preventable diseases over the course of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting was initially planned for February, but was abruptly canceled and then rescheduled upon the Trump administration coming into office, including the new health secretary and longtime anti-vaccine advocate, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. But, despite concern for ACIP's future, the meeting proceeded more or less as usual on Tuesday and continues today with additional topics. The last 30 minutes of yesterday's agenda was set aside for an update on the measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I find it absolutely devastating that we're having this update today," ACIP chair Keipp Talbot said at the outset of Sugerman's update. "There's no reason why we have healthy children dying of measles in the US when this vaccine is amazing," Talbot said, referencing the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. "It's highly effective and has very long-lasting immunity." Two doses of MMR offer 97 percent protection against the virus, which is among the most infectious viruses known.&lt;/p&gt;

"In adults aged &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/geriatric-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;65 or older&lt;/a&gt;, it went up 27 times."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These trends seem to be capturing major shifts in cannabis use and potential adverse effects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cannabis use does not come "without harm," although it's legal in many places, according to the researcher.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of older adults with an ER visit or hospitalization who later received &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nervous-system-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a dementia diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; was "also surprisingly high," he said, at 5% at five years and 19% at 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One limitation to the study was that the researchers lacked details on patterns of cannabis use and other &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;health behaviors&lt;/a&gt;, like smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a result, part of the observed increase in risk is likely related to differences in behaviors between groups that we couldn’t account for," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cannabis use is associated with "short-term memory impairment and long-term changes in brain structure," according to ICES.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We also only examined the risk of dementia for individuals whose cannabis use led to an &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;emergency visit or hospitalization&lt;/a&gt; — this is a small and higher-risk subset of all cannabis users and doesn’t tell us about the potential risks of differing patterns of cannabis use," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As medical and recreational cannabis use is now legal in many areas, Myran emphasized that it doesn’t mean it’s "without harm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Like alcohol and other substances, cannabis use – especially regular cannabis use or use of higher-strength products – may come with important risks," he cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings add to a growing body of research suggesting that regular cannabis use may have negative impacts on &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/brain-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt; and memory."&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="article-meta"&gt;&lt;div class="author-bio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angelica Stabile is a lifestyle reporter for Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fox News</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 17:08:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPZkh1ZDhFZmQ2MHkycEhoeVdqZWp2Y0REUzIxeWl6aHQ3ZzY4RklxUDVNbWJfTkFzMW5LODNnN1JXLWVvNmFQTlNmS2htN04xVVItdERWamx5c2xBRHk1S3JWcWtldHBlUWY5VndUMjBoa3RNaGJmT0VHeklXaTlhQnhZdkFWMkV3ckRaanFkejQ3YngyWGJ6WmowcWZFeVHSAaQBQVVfeXFMTWR1VTc4WWdXY044c2JHQjJyQ0Z5MXFEVl9yRWlWMURvdHUtUHRKMjRXRlhjSGpHSk5LSTJtSGJkd3NLZWc3NktWOTA5R1dHWURvRUtsMkhuLTJnOWdpVXZZUnEtemdkV3V2NmdzUkczS0pBY0pqRElYS0pQSGphMUozNzBoTHVqb3BHS2xNZXEtWjA2ZGdKa3lJaXFTcXE2VHhxT0I</guid></item><item><title>婚姻忠告：我妻子指责我对她不忠。原因真的很疯狂。-石板 | Marriage advice: My wife accused me of cheating on her.

We have not had penetrative sex since the onset of my problem.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9k0nptm002e3b73m0bu8hub@published"&gt;Within the last few months, I have been completely unable to get an erection around her, yet when I view porn or feel like masturbating, things come roaring back to life. She found me masturbating to porn the other day, and as soon I realized she was there, I went limp.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="103" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9k5nkxi00413b73pn75ku05@published"&gt;My wife saw what I had been doing and accused me of cheating on her (I haven’t) because in her mind, it doesn’t make sense that I can get it up in other situations, but I can’t when we want to have sex. It makes no sense to me either and I am at a loss as to what to do. It is affecting our marriage. I don’t think I need an erectile dysfunction drug because I am able to achieve and maintain erections, just no longer with my wife. Have you ever heard of this happening before, and is there a solution?&lt;/p&gt;

I reached out to &lt;a href="https://www.moushumighose.com/copy-of-about"&gt;Moushumi Ghose, a licensed marriage and family therapist&lt;/a&gt; and in the spirit of full disclosure, the head of the most recent sexology program I completed, for some insights into how you might start that digging process yourself. Here’s what she had to suggest:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-blockquote/instances/cm9k0md8a001r3b731jvbdel2@published" class="slate-blockquote" data-word-count="521"&gt;
  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really want to just first normalize the fact that erections are a very personal thing and the fact that he is not experiencing them with his wife is actually pretty telling. Whether it has to do with his own stuff or it has to do with relationship stuff, there’s something pretty deeply psychological happening here to him that is preventing him from accessing safety, comfort, relaxation all of which are required for arousal and excitement. He’s only able to do it when he’s by himself because that’s where it’s safe. This person probably could benefit from talking to someone (couples therapy/coaching as well as individual therapy). Also a little sex education goes a long way. The individual work will be very important for him to unpack what is going on for him psychologically. From experience, some of those things he might be experiencing may be that he’s afraid of being criticized, or he may feel inadequate next to her. A lot of times people experience erectile issues when they perceive their partner on a pedestal or to be “hot” and outside of his league, so to speak. These are just some examples. Essentially erectile issues are a form of imposter syndrome. And should be dealt with care, [with] someone that can help him unpack his fear, shame and guilt in a safe environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number two, as a society we expect men to just get hard, to just experience erections spontaneously because the wind blows, but there’s so much more to it. There is much more than the physical at play. There are emotional needs, there are sensual needs, and maybe none of those are really being attended to. Obviously, it’s really hard to say without knowing all of the information. But I think it’s just a reminder that this culture is especially hard on men and certainly, men get a bad rap because so many men are hard up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And number three, porn gets a bad rap. It’s important for the couple to talk about what cheating actually is without defensiveness and without blame. In her mind, masturbating to porn is cheating. In his mind, masturbating to porn is not cheating. I have a feeling that if she were feeling appreciated, she might not care so much about masturbation and the porn. This is ultimately a couples issue, and speaking with somebody who is skilled at couples sex issues can be helpful. [They need to come] to terms together around what is infidelity, what is not infidelity. For some people emotional infidelity is almost more important than actual physical infidelities. Having some of these conversations is really important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, it really feels like this couple isn’t talking much at all, not about sex, not about their relationship, and are jumping to conclusions and blame all too easily. Having heart-to-heart conversations, sprinkled in with a little bit of sex education can do wonders. In terms of the solution, it’s going to take time but chances are if they work together on this as a team, instead of opponents constantly blaming each other, they are more likely to experience success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Sure, I fooled around with people, but it was mostly oral. Intercourse felt off limits. I never allowed myself to have multiple partners or explore any other areas of my sexuality. I’d like to let myself free of these invisible shackles, if you will, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/12/sexually-inexperienced-man-sexual-liberation-virgin-experimentation-advice.html"&gt;but I feel it’s frowned upon at my age and gender.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three cases of a mad cow-like disease with a 100% fatality rate have been reported in a single county in Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the last eight months, health officials have confirmed one case and identified two probable cases of the rare brain disease, according to a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hoodrivercounty.gov/index.asp?SEC=AF40862A-8B0E-4107-B2B4-956029C71941&amp;amp;DE=11E4744C-DDC6-4DBD-8F95-B86EFBB310E6" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.hoodrivercounty.gov/index.asp?SEC=AF40862A-8B0E-4107-B2B4-956029C71941&amp;amp;DE=11E4744C-DDC6-4DBD-8F95-B86EFBB310E6" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement released by the Hood River County Health Department&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on April 14. Hood River County is located south of the Columbia River on the Washington-Oregon border. Two of the people with the condition have died, the department reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One case was confirmed by autopsy, while the other two are presumptive, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2025/04/2-in-oregon-die-of-rare-brain-disease.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2025/04/2-in-oregon-die-of-rare-brain-disease.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Oregonian reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Trish Elliott, director of the health department, told The Oregonian that the presumptive cases can only be confirmed after death by examining brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid — the clear fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord — and she said this process can take months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At this time, there is no identifiable link between these three cases," the health department added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mad cow-like disease reported in Oregon is called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/the-exceptionally-rare-disease-that-causes-holes-to-form-in-your-brain" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/the-exceptionally-rare-disease-that-causes-holes-to-form-in-your-brain"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (CJD), named for two German doctors who first described the condition in the 1920s. The disease impacts around 1 to 2 people per million worldwide, and the United States sees roughly 350 cases a year. About 23,000 to 24,000 people live in Hood River County, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/hoodrivercountyoregon/PST045223" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/hoodrivercountyoregon/PST045223" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;according to census data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so seeing three CJD cases crop up is statistically unusual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/64196-how-prions-spread-to-brain.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/64196-how-prions-spread-to-brain.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here's how dangerous, deadly prions spread to the brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like mad cow, CJD is a prion disease, meaning it's caused by abnormally folded proteins that damage brain tissue; in CJD, this causes sponge-like holes to form in the brain. The prions also cause normal proteins in the brain to turncoat, transforming into prions that then inflict further damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-pwy5nF8xPn7jt5SD2aAN8n" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-pwy5nF8xPn7jt5SD2aAN8n slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease can cause a slew of symptoms, including confusion, disorientation, hallucinations, lack of coordination and muscle stiffness, along with personality changes, new-onset psychological problems, and seizures. The symptoms progress quickly, leaving people with the disease unaware of their surroundings and unable to communicate. The disease is &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/creutzfeldt-jakob/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/creutzfeldt-jakob/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;always fatal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507860/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507860/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;about 70% of those affected dying&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; within a year of diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common type of CJD is "sporadic," meaning normal proteins in the brain spontaneously transform into prions for unknown reasons. The next most common type is genetic, triggered by inherited mutations in a gene called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/prnp/" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/prnp/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PRNP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The gene carries instructions to make prion protein (PrP), which is known to be active in the brain but whose normal functions aren't fully understood. Some studies suggest the normal version of PrP may help protect neurons from injury and form connections between neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most famous form of CJD is the rarest, however, accounting for less than 1% of cases. It involves prions entering the body from external sources. For instance, this can occur if a person eats beef from cows that have &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/animals/land-mammals/extremely-rare-case-of-mad-cow-disease-detected-in-the-us" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/animals/land-mammals/extremely-rare-case-of-mad-cow-disease-detected-in-the-us"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bovine spongiform encephalopathy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (BSE), better known as "mad cow disease;" &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/cattle/bse" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/cattle/bse" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;only seven cases of BSE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have ever been detected among cows in the U.S. Another potential source of prions is through medical exposures, such as a person getting a transplant or blood transfusion from a donor with CJD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent cases of "acquired" CJD, the U.S. has had &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/nvap/reference-guide/control-eradication/bse" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/nvap/reference-guide/control-eradication/bse" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;strict agricultural regulations in place since the 1990s&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to keep mad cow-affected beef out of the food supply. There are also &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/creutzfeldt-jakob/hcp/infection-control/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/creutzfeldt-jakob/hcp/infection-control/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;infection control guidelines to prevent the transmission of CJD&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; through medical procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hood River County Health Department has not announced which type of CJD is likely implicated in the recent cases, but Elliott told The Oregonian that they don't think infected cattle are the cause. And again, it appears that the three cases aren't linked to one another, the department noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The risk of getting CJD is extremely low," the department's statement emphasized. "It does not spread through the air, touch, social contact, or water."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department is conducting an "active and ongoing investigation" of the cases and has partnered with Oregon Health Authority and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "The health department will continue to monitor the situation and keep you informed of any risk to public health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-pwy5nF8xPn7jt5SD2aAN8n-MeSwaUZK2LmxlvhLiK0ooFf4LS35Y5w8" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-pwy5nF8xPn7jt5SD2aAN8n-MeSwaUZK2LmxlvhLiK0ooFf4LS35Y5w8 slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

A group of researchers in Spain has developed a drug candidate that could help fight the condition at its core—not by focusing on plaques in the brain like most previous treatments, but by stopping the damaging inflammation behind them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s is the leading cause of dementia worldwide. In Spain alone, more than 800,000 people are living with the disease. It has no cure, and current drugs offer only limited help for people in the early stages. But recent discoveries suggest that inflammation in the brain might be more than just a side effect—it may be a key driver of the disease itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research team from the &lt;a href="https://web.ub.edu/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; believes it has found a way to block that inflammation and protect the brain using a new kind of molecule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="targeting_a_hidden_driver_of_disease"&gt;Targeting a Hidden Driver of Disease&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new drug targets an enzyme called soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). This enzyme breaks down molecules known as epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which help reduce inflammation and protect nerve cells. Once broken down by sEH, these EETs become compounds that promote inflammation. Scientists found that in both people with Alzheimer’s and mouse models of the disease, the amount of sEH was unusually high, especially in the hippocampus—an area critical for memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;From left to right, Mercè Pallàs and Santiago Vázquez.

This approach could be especially useful because it doesn’t focus on just one part of the disease. Alzheimer’s involves a complex mix of problems—beta-amyloid plaques, tangled tau proteins, loss of nerve cells, and harmful &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-smart-immune-cells-continuously-hunt-and-kill-cancer-cells/"&gt;immune responses&lt;/a&gt;. By lowering brain inflammation and supporting nerve cell health, sEH inhibitors could treat several of these problems at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why researchers turned their focus to this enzyme and developed a new compound, called UB-SCG-74. The results so far look promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_promising_compound_emerges"&gt;A Promising Compound Emerges&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The journey started with an earlier version of the molecule, named UB-SCG-51. It showed good brain penetration and could block sEH effectively. Tests in mice with Alzheimer’s showed it did more than just ease inflammation—it also slowed down cell death, cut back on toxic &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/lifesaving-nasal-spray-targets-and-eliminates-proteins-that-cause-alzheimers/"&gt;protein buildup&lt;/a&gt;, and improved brain function. But the team wanted to go further. They created a modified version, UB-SCG-74, which is more easily absorbed in the body and lasts longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;UB-SCG-74 was tested in 5XFAD mice—animals that quickly develop symptoms similar to human Alzheimer’s. The treated mice showed better memory, stronger synaptic plasticity (the ability of brain cells to communicate), and fewer signs of brain damage. Even more exciting, these benefits lasted for a full month after the treatment ended. That long-lasting impact hints that the drug might not just mask symptoms, but actually change the disease’s course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;UB-SCG-74 outperformed both donepezil, a commonly used Alzheimer’s drug, and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/antibiotics-vaccinations-and-anti-inflammatory-drugs-found-to-lower-risk-of-dementia/"&gt;ibuprofen&lt;/a&gt;, a known anti-inflammatory. No signs of toxicity were found in safety tests, which supports moving the compound toward preclinical development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="strength_in_a_broader_strategy"&gt;Strength in a Broader Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists have focused on clearing amyloid plaques from the brain as a way to treat Alzheimer’s. But that strategy has often failed. In the past ten years, many plaque-targeting drugs have not shown enough benefit to make it to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;UB-SCG-74 concentrations in plasma (A) and brain (B) of CD1 mice after oral administration.

"Strategies that have been tried unsuccessfully over the past ten years have specifically targeted beta-amyloid accumulation and plaque formation in the brain, but there is evidence that neuroinflammation is a major cause of Alzheimer’s disease,” the study authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new compound works by restoring the balance of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/super-seaweed-the-key-to-anti-cancer-anti-diabetic-anti-inflammatory-treatments/"&gt;inflammatory molecules&lt;/a&gt;. It not only lowers harmful cytokines but also raises levels of molecules that reduce inflammation. This wide-reaching impact on many pathways at once may explain why the treatment helped preserve neurons and protect brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mercè Pallàs, one of the lead researchers and a scientist at the University of Barcelona and CIBERNED, says that this anti-inflammatory action is tied to improved blood flow in the brain as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;EETs play a role in keeping blood vessels healthy, so stopping sEH allows the brain to maintain better circulation. That could offer protection against strokes or oxygen loss, which often worsen Alzheimer’s symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="rebuilding_brain_networks"&gt;Rebuilding Brain Networks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice treated with UB-SCG-74 didn’t just perform better on memory tasks. Their brain cells also looked healthier under the microscope. Dendrites—the tiny branches that allow neurons to connect—were preserved. The structure of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/optical-deep-neural-networks-are-revolutionizing-ai-computation/"&gt;neural networks&lt;/a&gt; remained intact. These findings point to more than temporary relief. They suggest the drug may be able to stop or even reverse damage in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santiago Vázquez, another lead author from the University of Barcelona, says this result is crucial. “This could help preserve neuronal function and reduce neuronal death associated with Alzheimer’s disease,” he noted. The fact that these effects lasted even after treatment stopped suggests that the drug changes how the disease unfolds, not just how it feels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_road_to_human_trials"&gt;The Road to Human Trials&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the strong results in mice, much work remains before this compound can be used in humans.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;University of Cambridge researchers found metformin, which costs the NHS just 35p per pill, helped prevent acute myeloid leukaemia, a cancer that kills about four out of five patients within five years of their diagnosis, from developing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 3,100 people are diagnosed with AML each year but only one in five patients are still alive five years after their diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While those at increased risk of the cancer can be identified through genetic screening, there is currently no treatment to stop the disease from developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But scientists now hope metformin could be used for this purpose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor George Vassiliou, an expert in blood health from Cambridge and an author of the latest study, said blood cancers were harder to treat than many forms of the disease as there is no solid tumour medics can surgically remove.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Blood cancer poses unique challenges compared to solid cancers like breast or prostate, which can be surgically removed if identified early,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'With blood cancers, we need to identify people at risk and then use medical treatments to stop cancer progression throughout the body'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Rubina Ahmed, director of research at the charity Blood Cancer UK, which part-funded the work, said the study could one day unlock metformin as a low cost, easily available cancer drug which has years of safety data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Repurposing safe, widely available drugs like metformin means we could potentially get new treatments to people faster, without the need for lengthy drug development pipeline,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tanya Hollands, from charity Cancer Research UK, which also part-funded the work, added that while the study was promising it still needed to be confirmed in clinical trials with real patients.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It’s important that we work to find new ways to slow down or prevent AML in people at high risk,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While this early-stage research is promising, clinical trials are now needed to find out if this drug could benefit people. We look forward to seeing how this work progresses.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers say they are already preparing to run clinical trials on patients identified as having changes to their DNMT3A gene that put them at increased risk of AML.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms of AML can be hard to spot as they are similar to general illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These include fatigue, a high temperature, repeated infection with colds and coughs, bruising and bleeding easily, breathlessness, unintended weight-loss, swelling in the lymph nodes, bone pain, stomach pain and looking pale. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Current treatment options of the disease mainly consists of chemotherapy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest NHS data shows about 3.6million patients were prescribed antidiabetic drugs like metformin in 2023/24. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Separate data shows 26million metformin prescriptions were dished out in England in last year to the cost of £82million, which works out about 35p per pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Metformin is typically as a pill either as a standard tablet taken up to four times per day or as a stronger specially designed slow release tablet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It works for diabetes patients by improving the way the body handles insulin helping to bring high blood sugar under control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 15:05:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxQS0FCSHB0ZFZpd01OSTlpR0dkZXVYeHEtdVBIVURyMUI4dFo1UVlqeTFZNlRPWkNwVjVxQVVPSU41cUIzb21jVWtJSDdTaS1ya2tkeC0tZnBSMzNSbDluRjVZM1JZcUVtcmtqSTRSWjN1bWxYS2pnOF9wekk1X0k5YnFWVW5HX3BBWWNXN3lsaWpaaDJrZEFhX2ZnU3lQSGNidy1MeFhpQdIBrAFBVV95cUxNYUZYdE5YSWhjVUJxdTgwWUdrMVFCLWxKekw5SmU1YzlLOFBwUXF2VEZER0w0M01hZ1h3WkY2NXhENGZWUFE1MzR2ZWg1amRjUmxZeVVvVi1VeGJpX2V5bEFtWGpfNW8xeGpkSUt6bk5ZSXVfeGdEZ0xNR3BpU1pKQUxhY0p3RnhWbHRmdEtPX3JSV0lMVUFUck0zYzkwcFd0dGQ1SEMxRkdCbklz</guid></item><item><title>肥胖如何重新连接大脑的食物奖励回路-神经科学新闻 | How Obesity Rewires the Brain’s Food Reward Circuits - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZkFVX3lxTE9wN05uR21PSWhCa3FFb1NkeGdGZXJYSnJIa0xLeHJpZXF4LUtGd1prbTFYd3I0MTdteG5xSXVRZE9qT0QySWN6V004WTM0MU5XN1RhZGRQQ3JTOWRkMmJydk9Cdl9DZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new research initiative is investigating how obesity reshapes brain circuits involved in reward, motivation, and emotion, potentially driving unhealthy food decisions.

These insights may reshape drug development by allowing researchers to design therapies targeting the most dangerous fibril structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specialized AI Modeling:&lt;/strong&gt; RibbonFold outperforms AlphaFold in predicting misfolded amyloid structures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disease Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; It reveals how protein fibrils evolve into more insoluble forms over time, possibly explaining late disease onset.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drug Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Offers a precise tool for targeting harmful protein aggregates in neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Rice University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A novel artificial intelligence (AI) tool has revealed how disease-linked proteins misfold into harmful structures, a key advance in understanding neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by Mingchen Chen of the Changping Laboratory and Rice University’s Peter Wolynes, introduces RibbonFold, a new computational method capable of predicting the structures of amyloids — long, twisted fibers that accumulate in the brains of patients suffering from neurological decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108804"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-protein-neurology.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-protein-neurology-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-protein-neurology-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-protein-neurology-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-protein-neurology-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-protein-neurology-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-protein-neurology-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-protein-neurology.jpg" alt="This shows a brain scan." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-protein-neurology.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-protein-neurology-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-protein-neurology-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-protein-neurology-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-protein-neurology-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-protein-neurology-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-protein-neurology-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Beyond medicine, these findings offer insights into protein self-assembly, which could impact synthetic biomaterials. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Science&lt;/em&gt; April 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RibbonFold is uniquely tailored to address the complex and variable structures of incorrectly folded proteins rather than functional proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve shown how AI folding codes can be constrained by incorporating a physical understanding of the energy landscape of amyloid fibrils to predict their structures,” said Wolynes, the D.R. Bullard-Welch Foundation Professor of Science and co-director of the Center for Theoretical Biological Physics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“RibbonFold outperforms other AI-based prediction tools like AlphaFold, which were trained only to predict correctly folded globular protein structures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eclipsing the gold standard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RibbonFold builds on recent advances in AI-driven protein structure prediction. Unlike tools such as AlphaFold2 or AlphaFold3, which are trained on well-behaved, globular proteins, RibbonFold includes constraints suited to capture the ribbonlike characteristics of amyloid fibrils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers trained the model using existing structural data on amyloid fibrils then validated it against other known fibril structures deliberately excluded from the training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their results demonstrated that RibbonFold outperforms existing AI tools in this specialized domain and reveals previously overlooked nuances in how amyloids form and evolve in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, it suggests that fibrils may begin in one structural form but may shift into more insoluble configurations over time, contributing to disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Misfolded proteins can take on many different structures,” Wolynes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our method shows that stable polymorphs will likely win out over time by being more insoluble than other forms, explaining the late onset of symptoms. This idea could reshape how researchers approach neurodegenerative disease treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New frontier in drug development and beyond&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RibbonFold’s success in predicting amyloid polymorphs may mark a turning point in how scientists can approach neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offering a scalable, accurate method for analyzing the structure of harmful protein aggregates, RibbonFold opens new possibilities for drug development. Pharmaceutical researchers can now target drug design by binding to the most disease-relevant fibril structures with greater precision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work not only explains a long-standing problem but also equips us with the tools to systematically study and intervene in one of life’s most destructive processes,” said Chen, co-corresponding author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond medicine, these findings offer insights into protein self-assembly, which could impact synthetic biomaterials. In addition, the study resolves a critical mystery in structural biology: why identical proteins can fold into multiple disease-causing forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ability to predict amyloid polymorphs efficiently may guide future breakthroughs in preventing harmful protein aggregation, a crucial step toward tackling some of the world’s most pressing neurodegenerative challenges,” Wolynes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other authors of this study include co-first authors Liangyue Guo and Qilin Yu along with Di Wang and Xiaoyu Wu of the Changping Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study had support from the National Science Foundation, the Welch Foundation and the Changping Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this AI and neurology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9df0f9acaca8ddeff4fef8b3f8f9e8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Marcy de Luna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://rice.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rice University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Marcy de Luna – Rice University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2501321122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AI tool unlocks long-standing biomedical mystery behind Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt;” by Mingchen Chen et al. &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI tool unlocks long-standing biomedical mystery behind Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept that proteins are selected to fold into a well-defined native state has been effectively addressed within the framework of energy landscapes, underpinning the recent successes of structure prediction tools like AlphaFold. The amyloid fold, however, does not represent a unique minimum for a given single sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the cross-&lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt; hydrogen-bonding pattern is common to all amyloids, other aspects of amyloid fiber structures are sensitive not only to the sequence of the aggregating peptides but also to the experimental conditions. This polymorphic nature of amyloid structures challenges structure predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we use AI to explore the landscape of possible amyloid protofilament structures composed of a single stack of peptides aligned in a parallel, in-register manner. This perspective enables a practical method for predicting protofilament structures of arbitrary sequences: RibbonFold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RibbonFold is adapted from AlphaFold2, incorporating parallel in-register constraints within AlphaFold2’s template module, along with an appropriate polymorphism loss function to address the structural diversity of folds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RibbonFold outperforms AlphaFold2/3 on independent test sets, achieving a mean TM-score of 0.5. RibbonFold proves well-suited to study the polymorphic landscapes of widely studied sequences with documented polymorphisms. The resulting landscapes capture these observed polymorphisms effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show that while well-known amyloid-forming sequences exhibit a limited number of plausible polymorphs on their “solubility” landscape, randomly shuffled sequences with the same composition appear to be negatively selected in terms of their relative solubility. RibbonFold is a valuable framework for structurally characterizing amyloid polymorphism landscapes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 13:52:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE5FQnNRUHR5LXJYMWhxSlBNdDFwZUJOYVhDSDhqOG4yaVpYNWs4dm9vdUtQak9fUFNXcHNOYjc1aXR5c2lkWUJYdFJiTWpyVjQ1dG9rUDNsRXp1SWF4SWJ3Mmxxd21zWG5a</guid></item><item><title>与低生育率相关的心理健康障碍-神经科学新闻 | Mental Health Disorders Linked to Lower Parenthood Rates - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTE0wQVFKbGJRdEFOWjlMVUp6MEhmZGpQdHoyTlBQa3hEV0FiTU9WSnVQRG9VM0EtQlNwWFhDZXRBTTA0UVdGSlc4SWtmWUJXX3RzM0JUM2t6VnUxRnV4cVY3NDdVZUhvbWo3RjlZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A large-scale study using Finnish national data has found that young adults diagnosed with mental disorders are significantly less likely to become parents by age 39. The most pronounced effect was seen in individuals with schizophrenia, while common disorders like depression and anxiety also reduced parenthood rates—especially among men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Differences between genders were notable, with men generally less likely to have children than women with the same diagnosis. The study suggests that challenges in forming stable partnerships may partly explain these outcomes, emphasizing the need for accessible mental health support for young people navigating major life choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Parenthood Likelihood:&lt;/strong&gt; Depression reduced fatherhood by 38% and motherhood by 19%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender Gap:&lt;/strong&gt; Men with mental disorders were less likely to have children or cohabit than women.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schizophrenia Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Strongest effect seen in individuals with schizophrenia diagnoses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Helsinki&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study has revealed a link between mental disorders and a lower likelihood of parenthood among young people in Finland. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research comes at a time when many individuals are postponing parenthood to later ages. Concurrently, mental health issues among young people have become increasingly prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using Finnish register data from over 1,2 million participants, the study found that both young men and women diagnosed with mental disorders are less likely to become parents compared to those without such diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strongest associations were found for schizophrenia: persons diagnosed with this disorder were highly unlikely to have their first child by age 39 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, also reduced the likelihood of parenthood. For example, men diagnosed with depression were 38% less likely to become fathers compared to those without depression diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among women, depression was associated with 19%&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;lower likelihood of becoming a mother when compared to persons without depression disorder diagnosis. The similar difference between men and women were also observed for anxiety disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The differences between men and women were clear for many disorders, with men having a lower likelihood of having a first child compared to women with the same disorder”, says Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Kateryna Golovina&lt;/strong&gt;, university researcher and first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role of partnership status&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also explored the role of partnership status in the link between mental disorders and parenthood. Since stable relationships are often a key factor in having children, difficulties in forming or maintaining partnerships may partially explain lower parenthood rates among people with mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found a clear pattern: men with mental disorders were significantly less likely to cohabit than women with similar diagnoses”, says Associate Professor &lt;strong&gt;Christian Hakulinen&lt;/strong&gt;, PI of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The importance of accessible mental health services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight the need for accessible, high-quality mental health services for young people. Providing long-term support may be particularly crucial in helping people with mental disorders navigate life decisions, including family formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research underscores the importance of well-functioning mental health services with low-threshold access, ensuring young people receive the support they need for both their well-being and life aspirations,” says Kateryna Golovina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt; This study was supported by the Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies, University of Helsinki (KG); the Finnish Cultural Foundation (KG, Grant 00200993); the Otto A.

One such outbreak struck in 869 and left an unforgettable legacy that shaped the city’s future approach to epidemics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the deadly plague, Emperor Seiwa established the Gion Festival in an effort to appease the vengeful spirits that were believed to be responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That historical memory reemerged when the beloved Gion Festival was canceled in 2020 during the COVID-19 crisis.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-on-hard-earned-lessons"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building on hard-earned lessons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infectious disease clinician and microbiologist Dr. Miki Nagao from &lt;a href="https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kyoto University&lt;/a&gt; is leading a program that aims to fortify the city against the next big threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We might not be able to stop the next pandemic,” said Dr. Nagao. She and her colleagues have focused on improving detection, analysis, and response plans to minimize the damage a new pandemic might cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This effort includes improving local hospital networks and establishing rapid testing systems so emerging pathogens can be tracked and contained swiftly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her team emphasizes the importance of a citywide pathogen surveillance network that gathers insights from nursing homes, public health labs, and hospital facilities. These data points create an early-warning system for spotting outbreaks before they cascade into full-blown crises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reinventing-kyoto-s-pandemic-monitoring"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reinventing Kyoto’s pandemic monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A citywide approach has already shown results. One &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/irv.12977" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; reported that a coordinated testing strategy in Kyoto’s aged-care facilities helped limit COVID-19 clusters during significant pandemic waves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The network’s strength lies in integrating clinical data with large-scale sample analysis. Teams keep an eye on infection patterns, share findings with public health authorities, and adapt interventions quickly when new threats arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initiative includes high-throughput genetic testing to pinpoint specific pathogens. This allows for an efficient response by healthcare workers, who can then target treatments and reduce exposure in vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts also stress the need to understand communitywide behavior. Changes in social interactions, public gatherings, or medical practices all affect how diseases spread, so researchers examine these factors alongside lab data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-silent-pathogen-hazard"&gt;A silent pathogen hazard&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dangers of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-create-viruses-to-combat-antibiotic-resistant-bacteria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria&lt;/a&gt; add urgency to these efforts. An influential report warned that AMR could claim millions of lives worldwide by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One genetic analysis revealed that a single clade of &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/11/16-0519_article"&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/a&gt; has driven much of the global spread of this resistance. This insight underscores how a single microbial lineage can become a massive threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nagao’s team looks at both global trends and local cases. They study bacteria circulating in Kyoto and cross-reference that information with international data to identify worrisome shifts in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another investigation, the researchers found that particular clones of &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/29/3/22-1060_article" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Streptococcus dysgalactiae&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;carried sets of resistance genes that made these strains harder to treat. This evidence supports the push for more robust diagnostics and localized prevention measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-scaling-up-diagnostics"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scaling up diagnostics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/hidden-death-toll-of-covid-19-pandemic-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; highlighted the risks of relying on limited testing capacity. Dr. Nagao’s group recognized the need for powerful diagnostic devices that can handle large workloads while still delivering quick, accurate results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An automated system called PCRpack was introduced to speed up tests for high-priority pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. Its design lowers the need for extra technicians, which helps laboratories keep pace during hectic surges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research hospitals in Kyoto have set up these automated devices to run tests around the clock. Managers say it has prevented diagnostic bottlenecks and led to faster turnaround times for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic improvements are also vital for what experts call the 100 Days Mission. This global initiative strives to have vaccines, treatments, and reliable tests ready within 100 days of recognizing a new pandemic threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-joining-forces-for-tomorrow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joining forces for tomorrow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nagao’s team collaborates with medical manufacturers, health economists, and academics from various fields. Each partner contributes specialized knowledge to paint a clearer picture of how infections move through communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From our perspective, both epidemic viral infections and AMR are ‘pandemic pathogens,’” said Dr. Yasufumi Matsumura, an associate professor at Kyoto University. Specialists in immunology, vaccine creation, and bioinformatics share resources, boosting the collective impact of the city’s work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kyoto network runs on real-life data from patient samples, not just abstract models. It offers a clinical angle that bridges basic science and public policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-staying-ahead-of-outbreaks"&gt;Staying ahead of outbreaks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many research teams focus on either microbiological analysis or social patterns. This project aims to link the two. Such comprehensive data can guide health campaigns, resource allocation, and targeted interventions for potential outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To stay prepared, Dr. Nagao and her colleagues keep refining lab methods, strengthening collaborations, and watching for new pathogens around the globe. Their approach offers a blueprint for other regions that want to stay a step ahead of infectious surprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pathogens are invisible to the naked eye,” said Dr. Nagao. Her team’s greatest satisfaction comes from turning those hidden threats into detailed information that helps protect communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d42473-024-00344-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Portfolio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-ralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 13:08:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxNcXYyOTA5cS12S1Y4SjJzTFF2bDRJTjFRZm56aFRlakVEblVkSlJDUTR2TEcxVDhkel9vNVE3bnZVeVo1bm5CRnBya0tBSEkzTEF2a3RsNzJDc3B4bnFsNWFIaC1qWkRDRi0tZjdFSy1iaVpxUkQ2QkFZNzhqTnMyT3BobjlmcUVvZTIwZ05iWlBVZw</guid></item><item><title>植物性蛋白质饮食与长寿相关-神经科学新闻 | Plant-Based Proteins Diet Linked to Longer Life - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE5aWDNVVk12WXdGUW9xWGYtQlVmM1p5M3NOb0tyMHNjdVQ1cGRxWVpJMDZyRHVoT1BzWV9uMXd1bUtwR3RydFc1LUp6RC1zeFNBSmlja0NKWDNOUUVKdUdEdWx4OWl1MG0xZzFiRGNuUXMxdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A global analysis of dietary trends across 101 countries over 60 years reveals that populations consuming more plant-based proteins tend to live longer. While animal-based proteins are linked to lower infant mortality, plant-based sources such as legumes, tofu, and grains are associated with increased adult life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for wealth and population size, researchers found that countries with high plant protein availability, like India, outperformed nations with meat-heavy diets, like the U.S., in adult longevity. The findings support broader health and environmental goals, highlighting the benefits of shifting toward more sustainable, plant-forward diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infant vs. Adult Outcomes:&lt;/strong&gt; Animal-based proteins improve child survival rates, but plant-based proteins support longer adult life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chronic Disease Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; High meat consumption correlates with increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longevity Hotspots:&lt;/strong&gt; Long-lived communities like Okinawa and Ikaria rely heavily on plant-based diets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Sydney&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A global study by experts at the University of Sydney has shown that countries which consume more plant-based proteins – such as chickpeas, tofu and peas – have longer adult life expectancies. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, Dr Alistair Senior, PhD candidate Caitlin Andrews and their team in the Charles Perkins Centre studied food supply and demographic data between 1961-2018 from 101 countries, with the data corrected to account for population size and wealth, to understand whether the type of protein a population consumed had an impact on longevity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108792"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/plant-protein-longevity-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/plant-protein-longevity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/plant-protein-longevity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/plant-protein-longevity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/plant-protein-longevity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/plant-protein-longevity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/plant-protein-longevity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/plant-protein-longevity-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a salad." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/plant-protein-longevity-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/plant-protein-longevity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/plant-protein-longevity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/plant-protein-longevity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/plant-protein-longevity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/plant-protein-longevity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/plant-protein-longevity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Eating high levels of animal-based protein, particularly processed meat, has long been linked to a range of chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer.   Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;First author Caitlin Andrews said: “Our study suggests a mixed picture when it comes to comparing the health impacts of meat- versus plant-based protein at a population level.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the under-fives, a food system that supplies large amounts of animal-based proteins and fats – such as meat, eggs and dairy – lowered rates of infant mortality. However, for adults, the reverse was true, where plant-based proteins increased overall life expectancy.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methodology  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the impact of plant- and animal-based protein diets on human longevity, the researchers analysed publicly available data about the food supply of 101 countries across a 60-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data included the amount of food produced per country, along with the levels of calories, proteins and fats available for consumption.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The countries studied represented a range of food systems, including countries where the consumption of animal-based protein is higher, such as Australia, the US, Sweden and Argentina, and areas where the consumption of plant-based foods is more prevalent such as Pakistan and Indonesia.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to compare the impact of different countries’ food supplies on life expectancy, the researchers corrected the data to take into account the differences in wealth and population size between countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having done this, they found that countries where overall availability of plant-based proteins were higher, such as India, had relatively longer life expectancies than countries where animal-based proteins was more readily available, such as the US.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Animal-based proteins and health conditions &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating high levels of animal-based protein, particularly processed meat, has long been linked to a range of chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, plant proteins – including legumes, nuts and whole grains – are associated with a lower risk or chronic diseases and overall mortality rates, with studies suggesting that plant-based diets have contributed to the longevity in the most long-lived communities on the planet – Okinawa in Japan, Ikaria in Greece and Loma Linda in California.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead investigator Dr Senior said: “Protein is a crucial part of the human diet, but as eating habits change and developed countries look to decarbonise, where we get our protein from has come under greater scrutiny. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The knowledge that plant-based protein is associated with a longer life is really important as we consider not only how our diets impact our own longevity, but the health of the planet.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and longevity research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5c373d283539722f2c39323f393039251c2f253832392572393829723d29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Katie Spenceley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://sydney.edu.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Sydney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Katie Spenceley – University of Sydney&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58475-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Associations between national plant-based vs animal-based protein supplies and age-specific mortality in human populations&lt;/a&gt;” by Alistair Senior et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Associations between national plant-based vs animal-based protein supplies and age-specific mortality in human populations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transitions to sustainable food systems require shifts in food production and availability, particularly the replacement of animal-based protein with plant-based protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore how this transition may relate to demographic patterns, we undertake an ecological analysis of global associations between age-specific mortality, total national macronutrient distributions, and protein substitution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our dataset includes per capita daily food supply and demographic data for 101 countries from 1961–2018. After adjusting for time, population size, and economic factors, we find associations between low total protein supplies and higher mortality rates across all age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early-life survivorship improves with higher animal-based protein and fat supplies, while later-life survival improves with increased plant-based protein and lower fat supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we show that the optimal balance of protein and fat in national food supplies, which correlates with minimal mortality, varies with age, suggesting that reductions in dietary protein, especially from animal sources, may need to be managed with age-specific redistributions to balance health and environmental benefits.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 12:36:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE5aWDNVVk12WXdGUW9xWGYtQlVmM1p5M3NOb0tyMHNjdVQ1cGRxWVpJMDZyRHVoT1BzWV9uMXd1bUtwR3RydFc1LUp6RC1zeFNBSmlja0NKWDNOUUVKdUdEdWx4OWl1MG0xZzFiRGNuUXMxdw</guid></item><item><title>谁在模拟我们的下一次大流行- Newser | WHO Simulates Our Next Pandemic - Newser</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxQbEM5WkJGWmdfUnRsRnFjSlJqOXI1V1IyaC01SWtTY0Y2Qi1aRmg2VXVZU2VUaDlNTU13bVZkUFpTa1Z6ekptOHlKanY3YnlLbm53dGRpdm9LUkhNc0hsNlVzR2YzNnZyNHNRUHo1Mkl5N0lTU1U4MkFXLTl3RkxUNmQ3TEVENlFLUDBqSlpB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="divStoryBodyAbove"&gt;
                                
                                    &lt;span id="StoryTextTop"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                                        Five years on from the COVID-19 pandemic, some of us are trying hard to forget all about mask mandates, quarantines, and deadly disease. But not the World Health Organization. Last week, the WHO led an effort to combat a new pandemic—this one, thankfully, hypothetical. Representatives from 15 countries (but not the US) participated in the "mammothpox" scenario, where a fictional orthopoxvirus was unknowingly unleashed on the world as a multinational team of scientists and a film crew excavated woolly mammoth remains in the Arctic. After they traveled home to their respective countries, a familiar scenario played out with "uncontrolled spread" of a lethal illness, leading to "overwhelmed" ICUs, according to documents obtained by the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/mammoth-pox-pandemic-response-world-health-organization/"&gt;Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                                &lt;div id="divStoryBodyBelow"&gt;
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Mammothpox was envisioned as having a death rate somewhere between mpox and smallpox (0.1% to 30%). Though the disease is entirely imaginary, the exercise itself was &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/08/world/permafrost-virus-risk-climate-scn/index.html"&gt;based on real science&lt;/a&gt;. "Scientific research has demonstrated that ancient viruses can remain viable in permafrost for thousands of years," reads a briefing document. As permafrost thaws due to climate change, there are "concerns about the potential release of pathogens previously unknown to modern medicine." The documents offer "rare insight into how the WHO and its member states might react and coordinate in the event of a new pandemic," the &lt;em&gt;Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; reports.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Collaboration was key to the two-day exercise. Individual countries were given different pieces of information that, if shared with the group, would make it easier to contain the spread of mammothpox. Countries were also handed certain policies—open or closed borders, for instance—prompting "discussions around how we could harmonize those approaches," says WHO senior adviser Dr. Scott Dowell. Mammothpox was ultimately contained, showing "that when countries lead and partners connect, the world is better prepared," WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says, per the &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/mammothpox-mpox-covid-who-pandemic-b2733541.html"&gt;Independent&lt;/a&gt;. However, the WHO acknowledged containing a real outbreak is likely to be far more complicated.

                A health worker in Karachi administers polio drops — the oral vaccine — on February 3, the first day of a nationwide polio vaccination campaign. The country, one of only two where wild polio circulates, has seen a rise in cases due to issues with vaccination campaigns.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The world is so close to wiping out polio. But in 2025, there are sign that the virus is not quite ready to go the way of smallpox — the only disease eradicated by humans.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Two countries are seeing an increase in cases caused by the wild polio virus, which can cause paralysis and even death, particularly in infants and young children. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And the cuts in USAID contracts that support polio vaccination raise concern that other countries will see a resurgence as well.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even with in-country vaccination campaigns and global aid, Pakistan and Afghanistan have so far &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-polio-vaccination/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;been unable to stop transmission of the disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In 2024, Pakistan's numbers spiked to 74 while Afghanistan saw 24 recorded polio cases. So far this year, Pakistan has reported 6 cases and Afghanistan has reported 1. These new cases are tied to disruptions in ongoing vaccine campaigns. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Global health officials say there's real concern that those numbers could balloon and that polio could reemerge in other countries as well in the wake of the dismantling of USAID. In a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/03/10/g-s1-52964/rubio-announces-that-83-of-usaid-contracts-will-be-canceled" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;series of memos&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; drafted by Nicholas Enrich, the acting assistant administrator for global health at USAID, and obtained by the press, including NPR, the potential for damage is quantified with estimates of how many people would possibly become sick and die if the pause in U.S. aid continues. Enrich projected an additional 200,000 cases of polio that cause paralysis each year, and hundreds of millions of infections overall.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The sudden cuts to U.S. funding are also affecting efforts to eradicate polio," said director general of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in mid-March.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Kenya, for example, the International Rescue Committee was part of a team doing polio vaccinations along with the Ministry of Health and World Vision. Much of that work was paid for by USAID.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That actually was the first [of our USAID projects] to shut down on the 31st of January," says Mohamed El Montassir Hussein, country director for the International Rescue Committee in Kenya. "Currently IRC's support for polio vaccination in remote areas has stopped [because of the halt in U.S. funding] and future support is in question. The Ministry of Health vaccination efforts, though greatly impacted, continues."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;As for Afghanistan and Pakistan, the numbers there, while relatively low, raise the question: Why does the wild virus persist in these two countries when it's been eradicated from &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/poliomyelitis#tab=tab_1" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the rest of the world since 2020&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;? (Other countries have experienced cases of vaccine-derived polio, which can occur when the weakened virus in the oral vaccine mutates and regains its ability to cause paralysis).&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Here is a look at what is happening in Afghanistan and Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Pakistan is seeing a resurgence &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Usman Ali, a 2-year-old, is one of 74 children in five Pakistani provinces known to have contracted polio in 2024. He is now experiencing partial paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"[I fear] my youngest son will not be able to walk or play for the rest of his life," says his mother, Naik Margha.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ali lives in Balochistan province, bordering Afghanistan. When polio workers came door-to-door in late April last year in his village of simple mud and brick houses, the child had a fever. His parents worried the vaccine would make his illness worse, so they refused it. They asked polio workers to mark his finger with purple ink anyway to make it look like he'd been vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ali had fevers on and off for several weeks, and in June, began having trouble walking.  His parents rushed him to a private clinic for treatment. When a later test of his stool sample came back positive for polio, they realized it was paralysis and could be permanent. Since then, Ali has recovered somewhat but still has partial paralysis in one leg.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ali's community is comprised of seasonal migrants who travel yearly to herd their sheep, mostly in the plains of neighboring Punjab province. Their village lacks toilets and sanitation, and people defecate in the open, which health officials say puts around 2,000 other children at risk of contracting polio, which can be spread by contact with human waste.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"This is a vulnerable community. They can easily carry the virus from one place to another place," says Saeedullah Lawoon, a polio community communication officer in the district.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Polio has surged despite Pakistan's extensive surveillance program and repeated door-to-door vaccination campaigns, highlighting shortcomings in the country's polio program. Pakistan has struggled to maintain the necessary high rates of immunization while combating vaccine fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To be optimally protected from polio, health care experts recommend that children in Pakistan receive two doses of the injectable vaccine and at least three doses of the oral — an aggressive course aimed at interrupting transmission. In 2023, only 84% of the country's eligible children received two doses of the injectable vaccine, according to World Health Organization and UNICEF estimates shared by the Pakistan Polio Programme. while 86% of children received three doses of the oral vaccine during routine immunization.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have higher coverage in Punjab overall, but very low coverage in Balochistan, parts of Karachi, parts of South Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, parts of Balochistan and even Southern Punjab," says Dr. Hamid Jafari, the WHO director of polio eradication for the region. "[There is] huge provincial variation. Punjab is 60% of the country, so it can skew the national average." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates during door-to-door drives can surpass 90%, according to Pakistan Polio Programme data, but these campaigns only offer the oral vaccine. To receive the injectable vaccine, parents must travel to designated facilities. The injectable vaccine is harder to administer and requires trained health workers and sanitary conditions.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The result is that some children in Pakistan only receive the oral vaccine, while some aren't vaccinated at all.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More than half of the polio cases in Pakistan last year were from children who hadn't received a single dose of either version of the vaccines. The other 45% were children who had received the oral polio vaccine, sometimes up to seven times, according to case data. Experts say receiving that many doses is not dangerous for a child. Pakistan's Polio Programme says what's important is that every child is vaccinated during each vaccine campaign to maintain their immunity.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Pakistan's polio eradication&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;program was started in 1994 and made strides early on to significantly reduce the number of polio cases in the country, which used to be in the tens of thousands. Between 1994 and 2013, the country managed to reduce the average number of annual cases by around 96%,&lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.archive.polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/5.1_12IMB.pdf__;!!Iwwt!RS72jUWfN0OpNxIZE7i8yko7FAEuOXYySX0CvJs0N70RYfoCAAQDrWpsRLwmRMhWWRU05_TkXhcefKQ1$" target="_blank"&gt; from 2,635 to 93&lt;/a&gt;. Case numbers seesawed in the following years before reaching an all-time low in 2021, when Pakistan recorded only one infection&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Although cases have fluctuated in the past, experts say last year's increase was particularly alarming. Zulfiqar Bhutta, founding director of The Institute for Global Health and Development at the Aga Khan University in Karachi, says there's also not one reason why. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It isn't one single factor that leads to polio exacerbations, ups and downs in Pakistan. It's always a combination," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bhutta attributes the spike in part to laxity with door-to-door vaccination campaigns. In some cases parents or health workers will mark a child's finger who hasn't been vaccinated, which he attributes to fatigue among health workers under pressure to hit vaccination targets and exhausted from dealing with uncooperative parents. He also cites inadequate supervision of vaccine workers on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then there's vaccine distrust — still a problem in parts of Pakistan and in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;neighboring Afghanistan. Some think the vaccine will affect fertility, while others believe vaccines are part of a Western conspiracy. The distrust of aid workers grew after the &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2013/klag-CIA-vaccination-cover-pakistan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CIA operated under the guise of a vaccine campaign&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to search for Osama Bin Laden in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Polio workers also struggle to access certain areas because of conflict and security risks. In the past decade, they've become the target of militant groups who accuse them of being government spies or agents of the West.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In some cases, parents refuse vaccines for their children because they've grown tired of repeat visits by polio workers, who are required to give oral polio drops during each vaccination campaign to every child under the age of 5 — including those who've received them multiple times before.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;According to a September 2024 report by the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Independent Monitoring Board of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, over four million Pakistani children missed being vaccinated last year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Polio spreads quickly within unvaccinated communities, and mobile populations carry the virus from one part of the country to the next. People also bring it with them across the border from neighboring Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the past, both Afghanistan and Pakistan have each come close to eradicating the virus, says Dr. Jafari of WHO. But the two nations' vaccine campaigns didn't align, so pockets of polio can persist and spread between the countries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's been very difficult to find a time period where the progress was well synchronized so that they both would interrupt transmission at the same time," he says. "Polio is an epidemic-prone disease. That means that if you don't interrupt transmission, it resurges after every few years."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A number of recent cases involve children who avoided severe paralysis, thanks to some level of protection from oral vaccines, says Zia Ur Rehman, spokesperson for the Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme. "That is very encouraging. And it shows that there is always a benefit of repeated vaccination." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pakistan held its first vaccination drive of the year in early February in an attempt to ensure that all children under age 5 have received at least one dose of the oral vaccine, with the goal of eventually achieving herd immunity. This should occur with polio when around 80% of the population is vaccinated, although Pakistan presents a special challenge.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's no clear threshold for herd immunity in Pakistan, according to WHO's Hamid Jafari. "There isn't just one figure that we can go with in terms of what level of immunity do you need to stop transmission." He said the 80% rate might be an average figure for countries with better sanitation and less population density, but in South Asia, higher vaccination rates are needed to interrupt transmission.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The campaign aimed to reach about 45 million children around the country.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;According to Pakistan's Polio Programme, health workers vaccinated about 200,000 fewer children than the target, though it's difficult to independently verify.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The number of children nationwide who didn't receive the vaccine because family members refused was around 66,000, according to Pakistan Polio Programme data. The next countrywide vaccination campaign is set to take place in April. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the virus has been detected in sewage samples around the country this year, including in Punjab province, home to around half of Pakistan's children. Before a case was confirmed there last year, the province had been without a case of polio since 2020. Punjab has had one polio case so far in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bhutta said the widespread circulation of the virus means the situation could quickly spiral into something much worse.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is like sitting on the top of a volcano. This can erupt anytime."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changes in vaccination strategy leave some children behind in Afghanistan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A few months ago, a 35-year-old Afghan businessman named Mohammad noticed that his youngest son's hand looked extremely thin and was bending at an unnatural angle. A few tests later, he and his wife's worst fears were confirmed: "We were told he was infected with the polio virus," he tells NPR. "We missed his vaccines, and now a part of his hand is paralyzed."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mohammad, who requested his full name be withheld fearing reprisal for criticizing the Taliban government, blames his son's condition on the decision to suspend door-to-door vaccination campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-58128" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;In August 2024, the Taliban announced a temporary suspension of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/sep/17/taliban-curbs-women-risk-polio-outbreak-vaccination-campaign-health-officials-warn" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;door-to-door vaccination campaigns across the country&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. No official reason was provided; however, health workers familiar with the situation said that the ban was a result of suspicion of Western aid and the Taliban's restrictions placed on women workers, who aren't allowed to travel without a male legal guardian.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"They stopped the health workers from coming to the communities, and instead moved the vaccinations to the local mosques," Mohammad says.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mohammad, who has four other children who are vaccinated and healthy, says that campaign suspensions coupled with the Taliban restrictions made it hard for his family to get the children vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"As a sole breadwinner, I travel a lot for work, and the women in the family can't just walk to the local mosque to get vaccines," he says, referring to the Taliban's ban on women's movement.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Although the number of polio cases in Afghanistan is significantly less than in Pakistan, the spike was "extremely high" in 2024, according to health officials –- 24 cases compared to just six the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The main reason for this increase is the poor quality of vaccination campaigns, particularly the lack of house-to-house distribution system which has been very successful in the past," says an Afghan health official who requested anonymity, fearing Taliban backlash.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The spread is alarming, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While Pakistan and Afghanistan remain the only countries that have failed to eliminate the polio virus, Afghanistan had made some progress in reducing cases in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, the various Taliban groups in the region have long held suspicions that the door-to-door vaccination programs involving Western aid might be used to spy on communities.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As a result, for many years during its war with the U.S. forces in Afghanistan, the Taliban refused to allow immunization campaigns in areas they controlled. When the Taliban took over Afghanistan after the U.S. withdrawal in 2021, health workers had hoped they could finally be allowed access to previously unreachable parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Instead, the Taliban expanded their ban across the country.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Vaccination drives have also been hampered by the Taliban's successive bans on women's employment across various sectors, including in NGOs and development work.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Women are crucial to such campaigns because in a conservative country like Afghanistan they would be more welcome by families and communities with women and children, unlike the men, which allows them to not only provide vaccines and raise awareness but is also crucial to reporting some of the cases," the health official explains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-58130" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Children wait to receive polio vaccination in Nangarhar province, east Afghanistan, in November 2024 — part of a three-day campaign kicked off in 11 out of Afghanistan's 34 provinces that month, according to the Ministry of Public Health. Sharafat Zaman Amarkhail, the ministry's spokesperson, said 5.3 million children under age 5 were expected to receive vaccine doses during the campaign.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Instead, he says, the remaining, mostly male, health workers have been advised by the Taliban to conduct campaigns in mosques across the country, where families are expected to bring their children for doses. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This leaves many children unvaccinated since most families aren't aware or proactive about getting vaccines," the health official says, adding that for the vaccines to be successful, at least 95% of children under the age of 5 need to be covered during each campaign.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"For most families experiencing poverty, polio vaccine is not a priority," he points out. According to &lt;a href="https://unocha.org/publications/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-humanitarian-update-november-2024" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;U.N. estimates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, more than half the Afghan population relied on humanitarian assistance in 2024 from charities like the U.N.'s World Food Programme.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And in densely packed areas with limited sanitation, many children are already struggling with health issues that make them more vulnerable to polio.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Immunity among children is low and there are other diseases like diarrhea, malnutrition that is also spreading, alongside a lack of hygiene and sanitation which makes it a deadly combination," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Afghan health workers say they are continuing to advocate, alongside international organizations, to resume door-to-door campaigns. In the meantime, health care workers are encouraging parents to bring their children to local vaccination centers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If we don't act now, we may be faced with many tragic cases across the region, because infections don't see borders and can spread fast," the health official warns.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For Mohammad's youngest son, though, it might already be too late. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"All my children except the little one were vaccinated at home. I appeal to the [village] elders to [negotiate with the officials to] resume the door-to-door vaccinations again because not every family can travel to a public space and get the vaccines," he says. "It is not a matter of just my family or province, we are talking million of innocent children who are at risk."&lt;/p&gt;

The disease has been confirmed in one of the deceased through an autopsy; the other two cases are considered probable, according to a statement from the Hood River County Health Department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three cases were diagnosed in the last eight months. County health officials declined to provide particulars about the individuals, such as their age, gender  or town of residence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At this time, there is no identifiable link between these three cases,” a Hood River County  statement said. The county has a population of about 24,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by misfolded proteins known as prions. These prions lead to rapid brain deterioration, resulting in severe neurological symptoms and death. Although the disease is known for its sporadic occurrence, clusters raise concerns among public health officials about potential environmental or dietary exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include issues with memory, walking, coordination, speech and behavior changes, according to experts. It does not spread through the air, water, touch or social contact, according to Hood River County health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is considered incurable and is always fatal. Roughly 350 cases are diagnosed in the United States every year, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease" target="_blank"&gt;according to the National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is rare in people, affecting roughly 1.4 people per million. However, because the disease takes years to develop, any person’s chance of developing the disease is closer to 1 in 5,000 or 6,000, said Michael Geschwind, a professor of neurology at UC San Francisco in the Memory and Aging Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is similar to chronic wasting disease, or CWD, which is also a prion-fueled disease, and was detected for the first time in wild deer &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-05-09/deadly-brain-disease-detected-in-california-deer"&gt;in California&lt;/a&gt; and Washington last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CWD was first &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-chronic-wasting-disease#:~:text=Chronic%20wasting%20disease%20(CWD)%20is,and%20increased%20in%20prevalence%20locally." target="_blank"&gt;reported in 1967, in a captive Colorado deer. It has since spread to deer in 36 states&lt;/a&gt;. There are no known cases of the disease in Oregon wildlife. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades there has been concern that CWD could move into human populations through the ingestion of contaminated meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s because in the 1980s, a prion disease in sheep, known as scrapies — which humans do not seem to get — moved into cows, and soon people throughout the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-chronic-wasting-disease#:~:text=Chronic%20wasting%20disease%20(CWD)%20is,and%20increased%20in%20prevalence%20locally." target="_blank"&gt;United Kingdom, France and elsewhere&lt;/a&gt; were becoming infected with mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, public health officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and several states have been paying close attention to clusters of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease — investigating outbreaks to determine whether infected deer, elk or moose meat was involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They — and researchers from other agencies, such as the U.S. Geological Survey’s National Wildlife Health Center — also have been monitoring wild deer populations and keeping tabs on hunters who may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although widespread geographically throughout the United States and Canada, the disease is considered relatively rare in wild populations of deer, elk and moose, said Brian Richardson, the emerging-disease coordinator at the USGS wildlife center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It may well be [in Oregon], but it’s hard to find rare events,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, there are no known incidents of people acquiring a prion disease by consuming deer, elk or moose meat, said Geschwind, the UCSF professor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said roughly 85% to 90% of Creutzfeldt-Jakob cases are considered sporadic, with no identified cause or source of infection. In 10% to 15% of the cases, the disease appears to be genetically inherited — with some people acquiring mutations associated with the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there have been a few cases in which sources of infection or contamination have been identified, and almost all of them were from a medical mishap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nal.usda.gov/research-tools/food-safety-research-projects/preventing-human-prion-diseases-inactivation-prions" target="_blank"&gt;Prions are notoriously difficult to inactivate or destroy — withstanding standard sterilization techniques&lt;/a&gt; — and can remain intact for months and years on a surface, Geschwind said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a small number of cases, he said, people acquired the disease as a result of contaminated and improperly cleaned surgical equipment. In a few other cases, it was acquired by people who used products — &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/creutzfeldt-jakob/hcp/infection-control/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;such as growth hormone, or who received corneal transplants&lt;/a&gt; — derived, inadvertently, from infected cadavers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s these proteins’ durability and longevity that have many researchers worried. Studies have shown that deer that harbor the disease can pass the infectious prions to other deer through saliva, blood, urine and feces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, if the animal is licking a plant or licking a salt lick, for example, and another animal comes along and licks that plant or salt lick, then that might be a way of spreading the disease,” Geschwind said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the decomposing body of a deer that died of the disease can infect the surrounding environment where the animal expired — potentially contaminating plants, seeds, fungi and soil, Richardson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said not only is there the issue of surface contamination, but also research has shown that the proteins can “be taken up via rootlets and deposited in aerial plant tissues. Whether these plants contribute to chronic wasting disease transmission and what type of risk these plants pose to humans remain open questions.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geschwind noted that the work done by federal researchers to better understand the disease, provide diagnostic autopsies on presumptive cases, monitor wildlife and investigate clusters has provided a level of protection for the American public, which could be destabilized by proposed cuts to federal agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The idea of cutting government funding of rare disease is very short-sighted, because even though CJD is a rare disease, what we have learned from prion diseases has implications for all neurodegenerative diseases,” he said, noting Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson’s disease and multiple system atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All these diseases act in a prion-like manner in which normal proteins misfold, and those misfolded proteins cause the cells to not work partly and lead to disease,” he said. “But the basic mechanism that we’ve learned from this very rare disease applies to diseases that are thousands of times more common. To get rid of the research? It’d be a very grave mistake.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 10:00:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxOeHJ5UlRiODhDdTFNSGxDcDNQSTl0ZHBDRzZHZFZnMXk4Y2Q2UmhUb2JkN1lMWUhENTZLaDBjUFpiYnVCdnNpN1hYdVNVc2NjZHpONnFSSnB5YzBVQ0xiUy1Bd0VnUmxqbW5FQUN5Ny1sbk9YRFhoLTg1NjRndXNOWkRNajVnMDUzeF8xSDZVVk1wV0puRkVZMW0yTlJIeUkzUEVTTmNtQ2ZOaGdReXNfNXhHREZrU0liSEhzVnRGeUhuWm8</guid></item><item><title>研究强调了每年进行数百万次CT扫描的癌症风险- NPR | Study highlights cancer risk from millions of CT scans performed annually - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOYVkzNTdTcldUcFJSNm44SmdGQ29lckVxaVRwX3BIVVVUMEx1aUlzaHpzbmpZaDhUMjdjaXljbmxyUndncTVkMVJmeGVwbDNadXJ0V1pBRWdVS0l4TnYwRHpPWEQ2akJhNlZGSXo3UFZkTWpuSVdlcGN0WUZQeU9BSmlJQlZVeDhXTGFKcE0xZVhOcUJQQjJydGhoeFZoRDR4bjBZb2tKVXNsVnM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;CT scans diagnose afflictions from tumors to kidney stones to life-threatening diseases and injuries, such as aneurysms and blood clots leading to stroke.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the radiation emitted by this essential diagnostic tool may cause more harm than previously known and could eventually be responsible for roughly 5% of all cancers diagnosed in the U.S. in a single year, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832778#:~:text=Question%20How%20many%20future%20cancers,approximately%20103%20000%20future%20cancers." target="_blank"&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; finds.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Medical imaging has potential benefits," said radiologist &lt;a href="https://cancer.ucsf.edu/people/smith-bindman.rebecca" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiology professor at the University of California, San Francisco, and lead author of the study published Monday in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine. &lt;/em&gt;"It has potential harms as well, and it's really important to balance them."&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Scientists long ago established that ionizing radiation emitted by &lt;a href="https://www.nibib.nih.gov/science-education/science-topics/computed-tomography-ct#pid-1021" target="_blank"&gt;computed tomography&lt;/a&gt;, or CT, scans increases cancer risk. But, since 2007, use of the imaging technique has surged 35%, the study says, due in part to growth in what Smith-Bindman and her colleagues call "low-value, potentially unnecessary imaging."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Their new research, based on projections from hospitals in 20 U.S. states, estimates that 103,000 cancer diagnoses, or 5% of all cancers, could result from 93 million scans performed in the U.S. in 2023 alone.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's nothing you can do about radiation that you've been exposed to already. But you want to limit future exposure to cases when you really need it," Smith-Bindman said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some scans might add no diagnostic value, she said. Moreover, the amount of radiation a scan emits fluctuates widely and can be far higher than necessary with the operator, not the machine, making the difference, she said. The dose at one scanning facility can be &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/31/opinion/we-are-giving-ourselves-cancer.html?searchResultPosition=3" target="_blank"&gt;50 times stronger&lt;/a&gt; than at another.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Dana Smetherman, chief executive officer of the American College of Radiologists, praised the study for bringing awareness to the question of radiation risk. Some people are unaware, for example, that ultrasounds and MRIs do not emit radiation and that CT scans do, she said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"As radiologists, we always want patients to be informed and feel comfortable asking the questions, 'tell me more about this test, what's involved, what's it going to show you?' " said Smetherman, who was not involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Echoing &lt;a href="https://www.acr.org/News-and-Publications/Media-Center/2025/jama-ct-scan-radiation-study" target="_blank"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; from the American College of Radiology after the study's release, she stressed that the study's projection of cancer diagnoses from CT scans was based on statistical modeling, not actual patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are no published studies directly linking CT scans to cancer, the statement says. "Americans should not forgo necessary, life-saving medical imaging and continue to discuss the benefits and risks of these exams with their healthcare providers," it continues.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;CT scans use ionizing radiation to create cross-sectional pictures inside the body. The scans can reveal more detail than conventional X-rays and are accurate, quick and relatively inexpensive.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Nationally, the new cancer projections from CT scans put them on par with other well-known, population-wide risk factors for cancers, like alcohol and obesity, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832782" target="_blank"&gt;an editor's note &lt;/a&gt;accompanying the study points out. Cigarette smoking remains the leading contributor to U.S. cancers, causing 19% of them, followed by excess body weight at 7.6% and alcohol consumption at 5%, Smith-Bindman said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To curtail radiation exposure, authors of the study and the editorial urge changes to current practices.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The surest way to eliminate exposure to radiation from CT scans is to stop doing the low-value ones. Yet efforts to restrict them, including an initiative from the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation called &lt;a href="https://www.choosingwisely.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Choosing Wisely&lt;/a&gt; that launched in 2012, have fallen short, Smith-Bindman said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She believes the greatest opportunity to reduce risk from CT scans is to optimize the dose used in each scan.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We can absolutely try to reduce all those excessive doses," she said. "We need buy-in from physicians and hospitals."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She says patients can try to reduce their cancer risk by discussing with their doctors how important it is to get any particular scan and how they might&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;receive as small a dose of radiation from a scan as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The University of California, San Francisco, hosts a website called &lt;a href="https://knowyourdose.ucsf.edu/how-much-radiation" target="_blank"&gt;Know Your Dose &lt;/a&gt;in an effort to empower patients to ask questions about how much radiation they're getting from scans.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A brain scan, the website shows, can emit as little radiation as 200 dental X-rays or as much as 1,600. The radiation dose from an abdominal scan for a suspected kidney stone can be as low as 100 dental X-rays or as high as 8,000. Kidney stones also sometimes can be diagnosed with ultrasound, which does not emit radiation, the website notes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of the reasons for the striking differences in radiation emissions is that sometimes patients are scanned just once, and other times they're scanned multiple times. Multiple images often are unnecessary, Smith-Bindman said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Though she and others have been &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/ct-scans-cancer-risk-radiation-rules-research/" target="_blank"&gt;pushing for federal standards&lt;/a&gt; for dosages, there are none.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Under a &lt;a href="https://ecqi.healthit.gov/ecqm/eh/2025/cms1074v2?qt-tabs_measure=measure-information" target="_blank"&gt;Medicare measurement tool&lt;/a&gt; released in January, hospitals and imaging facilities share information about how much radiation their scanners emit. Based upon the information, Smith-Bindman and her colleagues are developing a quality measure for CT scanning. So far, she said, one-third of scans exceed the targets in their testing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We need patients to ask their doctors, 'Can you use low dose when you scan me?' " Smith-Bindman said. "It's crazy that patients have to ask for it, but it's actually really successful."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ronnie Cohen is a freelance writer in the San Francisco Bay Area.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="t-copy has-xxl-vert-marg"&gt;
    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;When Daisy Hildebrand became the second Texas child to die of measles on April 3, her physicians reported – &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/notifiable-conditions"&gt;per the state health code&lt;/a&gt; – the 8-year-old’s death to local officials in Lubbock where she died and in tiny Gaines County where the girl lived.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In deference to the girl’s family, who planned to bury her the following Sunday, officials determined that sharing the news with the public could wait until the following week. “There’s a protocol that is generally followed,” said Zach Holbrooks, the executive director of the South Plains Public Health District, which covers four counties, including Gaines. “We put information out in a measured, careful manner.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;But Holbrooks’ plans were dashed when the day before Daisy’s funeral, communication of her death was leaked by private channels and commandeered by a vocal, growing movement critical of vaccines. Instead of a clinical state or hospital press release, news of Daisy’s death came from the highly-charged writings of vaccine critic Dr. Robert Malone, a physician once labeled by The New York Times as a “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/03/technology/robert-malone-covid.html"&gt;Covid misinformation star.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/time&gt;
    
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;

  &lt;/article&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Breaking news: Another Texas child dies a tragic death after recovering from measles,” Malone wrote in a Saturday evening &lt;a href="https://x.com/RWMaloneMD/status/1908665463279677915"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on X. The Virginia doctor directed his 1.3 million followers to a 930-word substack essay where he accuses the University Medical Center in Lubbock of mismanaging Daisy’s case and purports that she died not from measles, but from sepsis after having been ill from mononucleosis and tonsillitis. She had already recovered from measles, Malone wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;That announcement — and the flurry of media inquiries that came next — perplexed community health leaders who spent the weekend stumbling through a communications plan, in which they reiterated that the child had died of measles pulmonary failure.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;More importantly, the revelation circumvented the wishes of the people most important in the case, Daisy’s family. Peter Hildebrand, Daisy’s father, told The Texas Tribune on Tuesday he did not know how his daughter’s death information was made public.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I have never even heard that name before,” Hildebrand said, referring to Malone. “So he’s the reason I was sitting there [at my daughter’s funeral], having to fight media off of the church?”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;It’s the latest skirmish in an ongoing war for control over the narrative around the measles outbreak, how the public should respond to it and the people who have lost children to the disease. Local public health officials, the state health department and leading epidemiologists have been encouraging vaccination to prevent measles' spread, while vaccine skeptics and the nation’s health secretary are downplaying the effects of the illness and platforming unconventional therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The mixed messaging is an added headache to local health departments — along with the &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/09/texas-public-health-federal-funding-cuts-pandemic/"&gt;expected cuts&lt;/a&gt; in the state’s &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/10/rural-texas-measles-outbreak-response/"&gt;already meager&lt;/a&gt; public health resources — and threatens to push the end of the outbreak even further.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“It’s just so tough to see all of this,” said Dr. Sara Safarzadeh Amiri, chief medical officer for Odessa Regional Medical Center and Scenic Mountain Medical Center. “The misinformation is making it even more confusing [for parents] to make the right decision for their child.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;During the first three months of this year, 60% more measles-mumps-rubella vaccines were administered in the South Plains and Panhandle areas compared to the same time period last year, according to the state’s immunization registry that a minority of Texans opt into.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;But, as some have sought more vaccinations, others seek dubious treatment methods. At least one Lubbock hospital has treated some pediatric measles patients for vitamin A toxicity after U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us"&gt;promoted&lt;/a&gt; it. The steroid budesonide typically used for asthma and the antibiotic clarithromycin, both of which &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1909049021211263268"&gt;Kennedy touted&lt;/a&gt; for healing “300 measles-stricken Mennonite children” are not evidence-based treatments. And public health officials say they face escalating threats from conspiracy theorists sowing doubt about the MMR vaccine, the only effective way to prevent the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Two shots of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective in preventing the virus. Measles is most actively spreading in pockets of Texas where vaccination rates fall below 95%, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19"&gt;the threshold needed to build herd immunity&lt;/a&gt;. Gaines County’s kindergarten vaccination rate is about 82%.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The outbreak will continue until everyone who is susceptible has been infected or gets vaccinated, Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security said during a press conference last week.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“If people are forgoing the vaccine because they think these treatments will work for them, that’s misguided,” Adalja said. “The fact that they are being mentioned by Kennedy is tactical on his part.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="d75e6668-9340-44e7-bfeb-518a50f63769" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;Recasting the measles deaths&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Malone is one of several medical practitioners who amassed a large online following during the COVID-19 pandemic, when he cast doubt on the safety of vaccines on podcast interviews, public demonstrations and on X, formerly Twitter, which at one point barred him for violating the platform’s misinformation policy.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;From his Virginia home, the infectious disease researcher has been watching the Texas measles outbreak with intense interest. He said in a phone interview with The Texas Tribune that media outlets choosing to highlight Texas’ outbreak among the many that are occurring worldwide is a “coordinated fear campaign.” And that campaign, he said, also aims to cast blame on Kennedy, who was confirmed as health secretary amid the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“There are statements that RFK was somehow responsible for the outbreak,” said Malone, who &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/01/24/robert-malone-vaccine-misinformation-rogan-mandates/"&gt;Kennedy has defended against criticism&lt;/a&gt;. “This is political propaganda.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Malone said he received an anonymous tip about Daisy’s death and then learned more about her case from a doctor who was “close to the family.” Malone declined to name that doctor but said the physician was not involved directly with Daisy’s care at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Malone said he transcribed those doctors’ notes and published the transcription to his millions of Substack followers on Saturday, the day before Daisy’s funeral. “That was a hot take,” Malone said. “The wishes of the family were to get this alternative narrative out — the true narrative to counter the false narrative.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Hildebrand told the Tribune he didn’t want Daisy’s death revealed to the public before the funeral.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;On the same day Malone broke the news of Daisy’s death, Kennedy’s staff was quickly scheduling an unannounced trip to Seminole, the county seat of Gaines County, to attend Daisy’s Sunday funeral.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In Gaines County, Kennedy raised doubts about the safety of the vaccine, telling Daisy’s father, “You don’t know what’s in the vaccine anymore,” &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/04/rfk-measles-grieving-families-texas/682386/"&gt;The Atlantic reported.&lt;/a&gt; Hildebrand told the Tribune he appreciated the secretary paying his respects to his family.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;It wasn’t until the day after Malone broke the news of Daisy’s death that health officials in Lubbock and the state offered a public statement confirming the child’s death by measles.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“The child was receiving treatment for complications of measles while hospitalized,” the release from University Medical Center stated. “It is important to note that the child was not vaccinated against measles and had no known underlying health conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;By then, the campaign to plant doubt about what Texans were being told by the medical community about the two children’s deaths was already underway.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="258f5c15-2bde-4569-84ef-d233cc21d6e7" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;Anti-vaccine group’s influence&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;For months, Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine nonprofit Kennedy founded but stepped away from after becoming the nation’s health secretary, had been generating news articles and videos about measles, pointing to outbreaks in highly vaccinated communities and amplifying possible side effects of the MMR vaccine, which are generally mild.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Leaders of the organization’s broadcast arm visited Gaines County to &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/20/texas-measles-family-gaines-county-death/"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; the parents of six-year-old Kayley Fehr, &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/02/26/texas-measles-death/"&gt;the first child to have died from measles in a decade&lt;/a&gt;. The Mennonite couple told CHD they stand by their decision to not vaccinate Kayley or their four surviving children who recovered from measles. CHD-TV Chief Scientific Officer Brian Hooker also casts doubt on Kayley's cause of death, insisting that she had a bacterial pneumonia that doctors could have treated differently.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;CHD’s video also lauded the work of Ben Edwards, a Lubbock doctor who CHD says has successfully treated many positive measles cases with unconventional therapies, including vitamin A, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/measles/measles-frequently-asked-questions"&gt;which can’t prevent measles but can be used as a supplemental treatmen&lt;/a&gt;t. Attempts to reach Edwards for comment were unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;By late March, Covenant Children’s Hospital had treated several unvaccinated measles patients who suffered from vitamin A toxicity. Some of those patients had reported using vitamin A to prevent measles, chief medical officer Dr. Lara Johnson said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;On the day of Daisy’s funeral, Kennedy posted on X &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1909049021211263268"&gt;a photo of himself&lt;/a&gt; with members of the Mennonite community along with Edwards and Odessa doctor Richard Bartlett, writing that both physicians have “treated and healed” Mennonite children using budesonide and clarithromycin. Neither method has been scientifically proven to successfully treat measles.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The following day, Children’s Health Defense uploaded a video with vaccine critic Pierre Kory, whose &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/13/doctors-accused-spreading-misinformation-lose-certifications/"&gt;medical certifications were revoked&lt;/a&gt; last year for spreading “false or inaccurate information,” claiming Daisy’s medical records show she died by medical error, not by measles.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“They are scaring people into getting a very dangerous vaccine and scaring people in what is a very benign case,” Kory says.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Kennedy later parrotted Kory’s claims in an exclusive &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch-rfk-jr-s-first-tv-interview-as-hhs-secretary/"&gt;CBS interview,&lt;/a&gt; saying Daisy died from a bacteriological infection and not measles. He also used the interview to plug his effort to get the CDC to study the risks of vaccines. Kennedy has repeatedly suggested there’s a link between vaccines and autism even though more than two dozen studies found no such connection.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;On Monday, CHD published &lt;a href="https://live.childrenshealthdefense.org/chd-tv/shows/good-morning-chd/second-measles-death-father-speaks-out--the-peoples-study/"&gt;an interview &lt;/a&gt;with Daisy’s father who detailed how his daughter had been sick in recent weeks and worsened after a family trip to Mexico. Hildebrand said Daisy was initially diagnosed with strep and mononucleosis but sent home at least three times by three hospitals: first at Exceptional Community Hospital in Lubbock, then at nearby Covenant Children’s Hospital and finally, University Medical Center where she returned and died, Hildebrand told the Tribune.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;With prompting by CHD, Hildebrand agreed with the nonprofit group’s assessment that hospital physicians were too focused on her vaccination status and measles diagnosis and less on other causes that they believe led to her death, including a bacterial infection.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I feel that if they cared the way they should that my daughter would still be here,” Hildebrand told CHD-TV, adding that he does not believe his daughter died of measles.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“The measles don’t kill people,” he said. “These foolish doctors are the ones that kill people.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The two Lubbock hospitals declined to comment on Daisy’s case, citing patient privacy laws.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="202b522e-9563-4a9a-9866-b286d7978440" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;How misinformation took hold in West Texas&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Since the first measles cases were reported, there’s been little in the way of public statements from elected officials about it and the void has been quickly filled by those who believe vaccines are unsafe, like Children’s Health Defense.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;By late February, the number of cases had &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-first-death-measles-outbreak"&gt;hit the 124 mark&lt;/a&gt;, and a 6-year-old Mennonite girl, later identified as Kayley Fehr, had died. Still, Texas elected officials offered little &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/02/28/texas-measles-abbott-lawmakers-response/"&gt;reaction&lt;/a&gt; other than to &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/03/texas-measles-house-public-health/"&gt;point the blame at undocumented immigrants crossing Texas’ southern border. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;State health officials have not yet confirmed how measles arrived in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Since the first measles death, state and federal staff and resources have been sent to the region to assist with vaccinations and testing. On most days, attendance at those clinics is minimal, according to local health officials. “I’ve driven by a few times and there’s nobody there,” said Collin McLarty, chief executive officer of Yoakum County Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Gaines County, where most of the cases have been reported, is also home to a large community of Old Colony Mennonites, a conservative religious group that speaks Plautdietsch, a Low German dialect. They do not &lt;a href="https://www.mennoniteusa.org/menno-snapshots/measles/"&gt;formally shun immunization&lt;/a&gt; but many do not opt to vaccinate. For decades, health officials in the region have had to rely on the members or former members of the religious community to help translate medical information for the group, making vaccination outreach even more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Meanwhile, state funding for immunization and outreach — which is mostly performed by public health departments — has remained stagnant in Texas. According to &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-vaccines-funding-cuts-5785985d6b74024b0502f6a2fc1576e2"&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;, Lubbock receives a $254,000 state grant each year for immunization efforts. That number has not increased in 15 years. In 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/10/rural-texas-measles-outbreak-response/"&gt;Texas spent only $17 per person on public health,&lt;/a&gt; among the lowest in the country, according to the State Health Access Data Assistance Center. A decade ago, it was $19 per person.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Buoyed by the general public’s weariness with pandemic-era mandates, the state’s most politically active critic of vaccine mandates — Texans for Vaccine Choice — continues to strengthen. &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/01/27/texas-legislature-vaccine-mandate-bills/#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20Gov.,by%20the%20Texas%20Workforce%20Commission."&gt;More than a dozen bills&lt;/a&gt; it supports are before the Texas Legislature, including those that would make it easier for residents to obtain exemptions to required childhood vaccinations to attend schools, as well as measures that would put more requirements on medical professions before a vaccine is administered.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="b205fa11-061f-43a6-8747-182fec298752" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;Resident caught in the communication crossfire&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Even residents in the outbreak area working to keep neighbors safe find themselves caught in the vaccine-choice crossfire.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;On Feb. 25, the Gaines County Public Library posted a notice on its Facebook page asking their patrons to “kindly” remain at home if they had been exposed to measles or were unvaccinated. Within hours, vaccine critics, including Texans For Vaccine Choice President Rebecca Hardy, hurled criticism at the library.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“This is NOT okay” Hardy said on her own Facebook page, reposting the library’s notice. “Public services should be available to the entire public, regardless of their conscientious choices. Correct this immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Sabra Hall, the library’s director, was shocked at the backlash. She had the notice pulled down within five hours.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“The majority of the comments were from people who didn’t even live here,” Hall said. “It blew my mind.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Nearby, the director of Andrews County Health Department Gordon Mattimoe, has faced similar backlash in recent weeks when he shared information on Facebook about vaccination clinics.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“You’ll have people from El Paso or faraway places that are just anti-vaxxers post comments to what we post,” Mattimoe said. “I try not to read the comments.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;On three separate occasions, Mattimoe said, he and his colleagues received threatening telephone messages from unknown callers who posit conspiracy theories that the MMR vaccine causes autism, a claim that study after study has debunked.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The misinformation feels like deja vu for Mattimoe, who recalled conspiracy theories thrown around online during the COVID-19 pandemic. Back then, Mattimoe would call out inaccurate Facebook posts and offer links to valid information.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;But that’s too time consuming for battle-weary Mattimoe, who said he’s just letting things slide to focus on pushing out the truth and treating people who want his help.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“It can be discouraging,” he said. “But we keep our heads up.”&lt;/p&gt;

Nature Neuroscience 2025)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system uses devices such as high-density electrode arrays that record neural activity directly from the brain's surface. It also works with microelectrodes that penetrate the brain’s surface and non-invasive surface electromyography sensors placed on the face to measure muscle activity. These devices tap into the brain to measure neural activity, which the AI then learns to transform into the sounds of the patient's voice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neuroprosthesis samples neural data from the brain's motor cortex, the area controlling speech production, and AI decodes that data into speech. According to study co-lead author Cheol Jun Cho, the neuroprosthesis intercepts signals where the thought is translated into articulation and, in the middle of that, motor control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;AI-powered system&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(Kaylo Littlejohn, Cheol Jun Cho, et al.

This "streaming approach brings the same rapid speech decoding capacity of devices like Alexa and Siri to neuroprostheses," according to Gopala Anumanchipalli, co-principal investigator &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01905-6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;of the study&lt;/a&gt;. The model decodes neural data in 80-ms increments, enabling uninterrupted use of the decoder, further increasing speed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Naturalistic speech: &lt;/strong&gt;The technology aims to restore naturalistic speech, allowing for more fluent and expressive communication.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalized voice: &lt;/strong&gt;The AI is trained using the patient's own voice before their injury, generating audio that sounds like them. In cases where patients have no residual vocalization, the researchers utilize a pre-trained text-to-speech model and the patient's pre-injury voice to fill in the missing details.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speed and accuracy: &lt;/strong&gt;The system can begin decoding brain signals and outputting speech within a second of the patient attempting to speak, a significant improvement from the eight-second delay in a previous study from 2023.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/what-is-ai-artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;AI-powered system&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(Kaylo Littlejohn, Cheol Jun Cho, et al.

The researchers overcame this by using a pre-trained &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;text-to-speech model&lt;/a&gt; and the patient's pre-injury voice to fill in the missing details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/apps-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;AI-powered system&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(Kaylo Littlejohn, Cheol Jun Cho, et al.

It allows them to communicate their needs, express complex thoughts and connect with loved ones more naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is exciting that the latest AI advances are greatly accelerating BCIs for practical real-world use in the near future," UCSF neurosurgeon Edward Chang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next steps include speeding up the AI's processing, making the output voice more expressive and exploring ways to incorporate tone, pitch and loudness variations into the synthesized speech. Researchers also aim to decode paralinguistic features from brain activity to reflect changes in tone, pitch and loudness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cyberguy.com/YouTube" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SUBSCRIBE TO KURT’S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kurt's key takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's truly amazing about this AI is that it doesn't just translate brain signals into any kind of speech.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9iz97va001t3b73b6kwsgzr@published"&gt;I am 25 and gay. I was dating a 30-year-old woman with a 12-year-old son. They both frequently spent time in my open-air loft. I have a curtain that acts as a privacy barrier in the bedroom/office area. There is a full bath upstairs but the previous owner put a half bath downstairs. There is no reason why my girlfriend’s son should ever have needed to go upstairs. If he needed something, he could shout for it. He was constantly breaking the rule about coming upstairs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9izi0tk002k3b73pbe6qwsz@published"&gt;He claimed he either wanted his mom or made up some lie like he couldn’t find the remote. We never had adult time when he was here, but the constant barrage into my personal space set my teeth on edge. His mom just continued to make excuses and didn’t enforce any basic manners on him over this. Then one afternoon after we went out hiking, my girlfriend had a work emergency and left her son watching movies at my place.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="166" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9iz97xd001u3b73323nsmcw@published"&gt;I went up to take a shower and drew the curtain. I yelled at her son not to come up. As I was running the shower, I stepped out in a bathrobe and went behind the decorative screen to get some lotion. When I popped out, I saw her son creeping into the bathroom with his phone out. I screamed at him and he ran and locked himself in the downstairs bathroom. When his mom got home, we ended up fighting because I “mistakenly” saw him trying to take naked pictures of me. There was nothing on the phone so I overreacted. We ended up breaking up. My dilemma is that I know my ex is currently dating a woman with daughters around the same age and younger than her son. I am worried that it might come across as vindictive and paranoid if I tell her something, but I would never forgive myself if I saw these girls end up on the nightly news. Help!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9iz984d001x3b73ob5idwai@published"&gt;I don’t think you have enough to go on to accuse this kid of being a pervert. It sounds like he’s pretty open and non-sneaky about his lack of regard for personal space and always wanting to be around an adult. And he behaved similarly when you were there without your ex as when she was around: making his way throughout the house to where the grown-ups were.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9iz986m001y3b73nne39c7p@published"&gt;I’m sure the shower incident was jarring and even disturbing, and it was totally reasonable for you to want assurances that no photos were taken. But the fact that his phone was out, to me, doesn’t say much. Everyone’s phone is out all the time. At least some of your disgust seems to be coming from the fact that you just found this kid really annoying. It’s good you’re not dating his mom anymore and don’t have to navigate this dynamic. But he’s just a child and the evidence against him is super spotty. You should trust that your ex’s new partner will take appropriate precautions when it comes to the way she supervises her daughters around other kids, including their clingy new potential &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;stepbrother.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Every. Time. We’ve known each other for a decade, so I would think she’d understand by now that this is just, you know, how I look. I’ve tried everything: laughing it off, ignoring it, attempting elaborate under-eye concealer hacks gleaned from YouTube beauty influencers, talking to my husband about how it makes me feel&lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/11/mother-in-law-says-i-look-tired-all-the-time-dear-prudence-advice.html"&gt;—that is, terrible…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts say the treatment plan could slash hospital admissions as well as reduce steroid-related deaths&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our findings occurred without any of the associated adverse effects or costs of taking higher doses of steroids', said Dr Durrington.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first of its kind study examined 21 patients with asthma who were asked to take their inhalers three different ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once they had completed a week of one treatment plan, the patients then switched to a different dosage pattern until they had all completed all three treatment plans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These dosage patterns included a once daily dose in the morning, between 8am and 9am, a dose between 3pm and 4pm, and a half-dose split between morning and evening — the recommended dosage pattern in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patients had a two-week break between each treatment plan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found that while all regimes appeared to improve asthma control, the once-daily afternoon dose had the biggest impact on night-time lung function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies show that  up to three quarters of patients experience worsening symptoms overnight, while around 80 per cent of fatal asthma attacks occur at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on the study, Dr Erika Kennington, head of research and innovation at Asthma and Lung UK, said it was a 'brilliantly simple' study which had major implications for patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It’s incredible to think that something so easy as switching the timing of your inhaler dose to the afternoon, has the potential to improve your symptoms and ultimately could save your life,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Inhaler medication is vital to keep your asthma under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It’s easy to forget that asthma attacks can be fatal and require daily management in the form of inhalers to stay healthy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The respiratory condition asthma affects around 7.2million people in the UK, and asthma attacks kill, on average, three people in Britain every day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It affects the airways, or breathing tubes, that carry air in and out of the lungs, causing them to become inflamed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This makes the airways narrower so less air gets into and out of the lungs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms include wheezing, breathlessness, a cough or a tight chest — and are often triggered by factors in the environment like pollution, stress or a cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Inhalers work to control the disease by reducing the number of blood cells that contribute to the lung inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In the 1940s, the Austrian psychiatrist Leo Kanner had coined the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/740316" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;controversial "refrigerator mother" theory&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that autism arose from early childhood trauma, created by mothers who were cold, uncaring and rejected their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Daniel Geschwind, a neuroscience and genetics professor at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), says that this is now rightly recognised as being deeply damaging and wrong – but it took the better part of three decades for Kanner's theory to be debunked. It was not until 1977, when a couple of psychiatrists carried out &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7610.1977.tb00443.x" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;a landmark study&lt;/a&gt; demonstrating that autism often runs in identical twins, that a more nuanced and accurate picture of autism's origins began to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;That 1977 study was the first time that a genetic component of autism had been identified. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10519-019-09987-2" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Research has since shown&lt;/a&gt; that when one identical twin is autistic, the likelihood that the other twin will be too can be more than 90%. Meanwhile, the chances of fraternal twins of the same sex each sharing a diagnosis of autism are &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4104233/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;around 34%&lt;/a&gt;. These levels are substantially higher than the typical &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/autism/data-research/index.html" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;rate of occurrence&lt;/a&gt; among the wider population, of around 2.8%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It is now widely accepted that there is a strong genetic component to autism. But which genes are involved and how their expression is influenced by other factors are only just starting to be unravelled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;&lt;span id="tiny-differences" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="tiny-differences" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;Tiny differences&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Even after the twin study in 1977, it would take several more decades for the full subtleties of the interaction between autism and the human genome to become apparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Between any two individuals, the amount of genetic variation is around 0.1%, meaning that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20363" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;approximately one letter or base pair out of every 1,000&lt;/a&gt; in their DNA will be different. "Sometimes these variations have no effect at all," says Thomas Bourgeron, a neuroscience professor at the Institut Pasteur in Paris. "Sometimes they have a little effect, and sometimes they have a super strong effect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Currently, "super strong" variations have been identified in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.annualreviews.org/docserver/fulltext/genet/58/1/annurev-genet-111523-102614.pdf?expires=1737804358&amp;amp;id=id&amp;amp;accname=guest&amp;amp;checksum=4D0BAC3B009C70D9E191504A807706B3" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;up to 20%&lt;/a&gt; of all cases of autism, with a single mutation in a single gene being largely responsible for driving critical neurodevelopmental differences. The role of these single gene mutations and how they arise is one of the most heavily studied areas in autism research, because as Bourgeron explains, they often result in severe and life-limiting disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l4k9cm.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l4k9cm.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l4k9cm.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l4k9cm.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l4k9cm.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l4k9cm.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l4k9cm.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l4k9cm.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l4k9cm.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l4k9cm.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images For most autistic people, their neurodiversity is thought to arise from the combined action of thousands of different gene variants (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;For most autistic people, their neurodiversity is thought to arise from the combined action of thousands of different gene variants (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"This is not like the autism you see in the movies," Bourgeron says. "If you're born with one of these major mutations, there's a high likelihood you'll end up with intellectual disability or motor delay [the ability to coordinate muscle groups] or epileptic encephalopathy. It has a major impact on their quality of life and their family in most cases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;So far scientists have identified &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2215632120" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;at least 100 genes&lt;/a&gt; where these mutations can occur. Bourgeron himself made one of the first discoveries in March 2003 when he &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ng1136" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;identified two gene mutations&lt;/a&gt; linked to autism. Each impacted proteins involved in synaptogenesis, the process of forming connections between neurons in the brain. It was a major breakthrough, although it barely made a ripple in the media at the time, with Bourgeron recalling how former US President George W Bush had &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/03/14/a-look-back-at-how-fear-and-false-beliefs-bolstered-u-s-public-support-for-war-in-iraq/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;recently declared war&lt;/a&gt; on Iraq. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But more discoveries were to come, including &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17173049/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;mutations in the Shank3 gene&lt;/a&gt; which are estimated to occur in less than &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3573207/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;1% of people with autism&lt;/a&gt;. We now know that some of these mutations are known as &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/genetics/articles/10.3389/fgene.2018.00406/full" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;i id="de-novo" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; variants&lt;/a&gt;, which means that they occur through random chance in a developing embryo and aren't present in the blood DNA of either the mother or father. Geschwind describes &lt;i id="de-novo" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; variants as being akin to a "bolt of lightning", that is both unexpected and rare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, in other cases, these mutations can have been passed on by one of the parents, even if both appear to be neurotypical, a more complex phenomenon which researchers have only begun to understand in the past decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"You might wonder, if an autistic child has inherited a rare gene mutation from one of their parents, why doesn't the parent have autism too?" says Geschwind. "What seems to happen is that in the parent, it's not sufficient to be causal, but in the child, that major gene mutation combines additively with other, less individually impactful gene variants to drive neurodevelopment differences," he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Of course, there are also thought to be environmental factors involved in the development of autism – even among identical twins where one has been diagnosed, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10519-019-09987-2" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;10% of the time&lt;/a&gt; the other one will not be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Historically, identifying the environmental factors behind autism has led to pseudoscientific beliefs such as the idea – &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/reel/video/p09zhlch/the-origins-of-one-of-the-biggest-frauds-in-the-world-" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;now widely debunked&lt;/a&gt; – that certain vaccines might be involved. Now the US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr has pledged a massive research effort to &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj0z9nmzvdlo" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;identify the causes of autism&lt;/a&gt; before September 2025.

It appears that many of these genes become functional &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02408-2" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;during the formation of the cortex&lt;/a&gt; – the wrinkly outer layer of the brain responsible for many high-level functions, including memory, problem-solving and thinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This critical part of brain development occurs in the foetus &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378378224001786" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;as it is developing in the womb&lt;/a&gt;, and according to Geschwind, peaks somewhere between 12 and 24 weeks. "You can think of these mutations as disrupting the normal patterns of development, knocking development off of its normal track so to speak and maybe onto another tributary, instead of the normal, neurotypical pattern of development," says Geschwind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Because they cause such severe disability, the information about these gene mutations has enabled parents to form support groups, for example the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.scn2a.org/autism.html" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;FamilieSCN2A Foundation&lt;/a&gt; which serves as a community for families of autistic children where the autism diagnosis has been linked to a genetic change in the SCN2A gene. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37843780/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Discussions have also been&lt;/a&gt; held regarding the idea of using such genetic information to influence future reproductive decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"If it's a &lt;i id="de-novo" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; variant, then you can tell the parents that the risk would be low [of having another child with the same neurodevelopmental challenges], because there is a limited contribution from inherited factors, if they decided to have subsequent children," says Geschwind. "We can also give the family a sense of the spectrum of how their child might develop over time, and for parents of a two-year-old that's non-verbal and has some walking delay, they want to know what to expect." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But while this can offer huge benefits for these families, the concept of genetic research is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11586462/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;not viewed with universal positivity&lt;/a&gt; across the autistic community. Autism is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/autism-spectrum-disorders" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;a vast spectrum&lt;/a&gt;, ranging from those with severe impairments in physical and mental development which will never allow them to live independently, to others with far fewer support needs who view their autism as an identity and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6493410/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;advantage&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8992913/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;oppose depictions&lt;/a&gt; of autism as a disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l4kb1x.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l4kb1x.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l4kb1x.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l4kb1x.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l4kb1x.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l4kb1x.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l4kb1x.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l4kb1x.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l4kb1x.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l4kb1x.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images For many people, autism is just part of the broad spectrum of human experience – and not something to be treated (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;For many people, autism is just part of the broad spectrum of human experience – and not something to be treated (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Because of this, for some autistic people, their families and a number of academic researchers, the compilation of genetic data &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1769721223001167" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;has yielded ongoing concerns&lt;/a&gt; about how it might be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;&lt;span id="a-complex-picture" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="a-complex-picture" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;A complex picture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In the past half century, genetics studies have shown that in the majority of autistic people, their neurodiversity arises through &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3579743/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;the additive effects&lt;/a&gt; of hundreds or &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867419308360" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;even thousands&lt;/a&gt; of relatively common gene variants which they have inherited from both parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;These gene variants exist throughout the population of both neurotypical and neurodivergent people, and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8477228/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;the individual contribution of any one of these genes to neurodevelopment is negligible&lt;/a&gt;. But in combination, they have a significant effect on the wiring of the brain. Bourgeron says that it is not uncommon for one or both parents, who carry some of these gene variants, to display autistic traits such as a preference for order, difficulties in detecting emotions, and being hyperaware of patterns; but unlike their child, these traits do not manifest to such a significant degree that they themselves could be diagnosed as autistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Over the last 20 years, autism researchers have devised some ingenious ways of identifying some of these more subtle variants. In the early 2000s, Simon Baron-Cohen, a professor of psychology and psychiatry at the University of Cambridge, and colleagues, devised a test called &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2001_BCetal_adulteyes.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Reading the Mind in the Eyes.&lt;/a&gt; This is intended to assess a person's ability to detect emotions such as looking playful, comforting, irritated or bored – based on a photograph which shows only the person's eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The idea is that poorer performance on the test indicates a higher likelihood of a person being autistic. "Autistic individuals have a different way of looking at the face, and they seem to get more information from a person's mouth," says Bourgeron. "Neurotypical individuals get more information from the eyes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;More recently, in partnership with the DNA testing site 23andMe, which agreed to host the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test on their website, Bourgeron and Baron-Cohen &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28584286/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;were able to gather data&lt;/a&gt; on the abilities of more than 88,000 people to read thoughts and emotions from a person's eyes, and compare this performance with their genetic information. Through this dataset, they were able to identify large groups of gene variants associated with poorer emotion recognition, many of which are thought to be carried by autistic people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Other research studies have found that common gene variants associated with autism &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.30.21262845v4.full" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;tend to be&lt;/a&gt; negatively correlated with empathy or social communication. But they are &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6722082" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;positively correlated&lt;/a&gt; with the ability to analyse and construct systems as well as rules and routines. Most intriguingly, they are also often linked to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8743131/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;higher educational attainment&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4927579/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;greater spatial or mathematical or artistic abilities&lt;/a&gt;. "This perhaps explains why these genetic variants, which come from very distant ancestors, have remained in the population throughout human history," says Geschwind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Geschwind and Baron-Cohen are now embarking on a project to try to understand whether some of the common gene variants linked with autism can explain why autism &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3114757/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;seems to be more prevalent in men&lt;/a&gt;, and why autistic women are &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10060524/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;thought to be more adept&lt;/a&gt; at masking their neurodivergent traits compared with autistic men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The likelihood is that differences in male and female brain development and function make the men more susceptible and the women protected from the genetic susceptibility to autism to some degree, but we don't fully understand that yet," says Geschwind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, some experts believe that autism may be much more common in women than is currently thought, and that the experiences of this group are &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.2147/NDT.S372723" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;being overlooked&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;Autism isn't a biological phenomenon that has to be tested for, and where you get a categorical outcome or prognosis – Sue Fletcher-Watson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Geschwind suggests that understanding sex differences in autism could help identify protective factors which could be used as future treatments, yet this very concept remains deeply divisive and reflective of one of the core underlying tensions within autism research. While some scientists &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://projects.research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/en/horizon-magazine/autism-cures-may-be-closer-focus-turns-early-treatment" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;pursue treatments&lt;/a&gt;, other researchers and some autistic people believe that autism is not a disorder to be fixed, but &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10074754/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;an identity and a shared experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Autism isn't a biological phenomenon that has to be tested for, and where you get a categorical outcome or prognosis," says Sue Fletcher-Watson, professor of developmental psychology at the University of Edinburgh. "It isn't something, like cancer, that is universally agreed to be bad and for which everyone wants a cure. In my opinion, it never will be."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In particular, Fletcher-Watson says that many autistic people fear that the ultimate outcome of autism genetic research will be a prenatal test, which could pose an existential threat to autism. Beginning in 2005, one activist created &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-13-8437-0_9" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;the Autistic Genocide Clock&lt;/a&gt;, stating that if such a test existed, it would represent a continuation of historic attempts to eliminate minority groups. Two decades later, such fears remain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Genetic researchers on the whole have done little to listen to, and address, the fears of the autistic community regarding security and future use of genetic data," says Fletcher-Watson. These fears are heightened by political contexts, she says, such as the strength of certain far-right parties, which make the possibility of eugenic use of genetic data seem much more real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prenatal tests are already &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/screening-for-downs-edwards-pataus-syndrome/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;established practice in the UK&lt;/a&gt; for conditions caused by having an extra copy of a chromosome in some or all of the body’s cells.

"These are different things," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;To try and better stratify the broad spectrum of autistic traits, the Lancet Commission &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01541-5/abstract" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;formally recognised&lt;/a&gt; the term "profound autism" in 2021, as a way of describing autistic people who are unable to advocate for themselves and are likely to require 24-hour support throughout their lives. Since then, a variety of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06662188?term=Jaguar%20Gene%20Therapy&amp;amp;rank=1" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; have begun, all using various therapeutic strategies to try and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10886956/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;target the single genes&lt;/a&gt; underpinning physical and intellectual disability in different individuals with profound autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The main idea for these treatments surrounds the fact that all of us have &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.jax.org/news-and-insights/minute-to-understanding/what-is-an-allele" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;two copies or alleles, or variants, of every single gene&lt;/a&gt;, one from each parent. A &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.13.584921v1" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; from Geschwind's lab leveraged the understanding that most of the &lt;i id="de-novo" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; gene mutations linked with profound autism only knock out one of these copies, suggesting it might be possible to reduce the degree of disability by boosting the unaffected copy. "That means you have one unaffected copy, [the activity of which] which we showed could be turned up to compensate," says Geschwind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Bourgeron has recently been running &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmsf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Effects-of-Lithium-in-Patients-With-Autism-Spectrum-Disorder-and-Phelan-McDermid-Syndrome.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;a clinical trial using the metal lithium&lt;/a&gt; to boost a version of the Shank3 gene in autistic children who are known to have Shank3 mutations. In the future, Geschwind suggests that a technology such as Crispr, which allows scientists to edit a person's DNA, could be used to intervene at an even earlier stage of life. For example, gene therapy could be delivered to unborn babies found to have various mutations, while they are still in the womb. "We've recently figured out a way of doing this," he says. "It might not fully correct the impacted gene, but it could at least partially correct it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The FDA has recently granted approval for the US-based biotechnology company Jaguar Gene Therapy &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jaguargenetherapy.com/press-release/jaguar-gene-therapy-to-initiate-inaugural-pediatric-clinical-trial-targeting-a-genetic-form-of-autism-spectrum-disorder-and-phelan-mcdermid-syndrome/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;to run a clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; where a gene therapy is administered to autistic children with a Shank3 gene mutation along with a co-occurring genetic condition called Phelan-McDermid syndrome which affects development, speech and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"This trial is only possible because all the children participating have genetic diagnoses," says Buxbaum. "And because researchers at Mount Sinai and elsewhere have spent the past 15 years studying how these children develop when they have these mutations. We can then use this natural history data as a control in the study."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But while such trials could undoubtedly result in enormous benefits for the children involved and their families, Fletcher-Watson is still sceptical about their depiction as therapies for autism, profound or otherwise. She would prefer to see them characterised as treatments for intellectual disability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I believe that when people talk about these single-gene cases of autism, they are being disingenuous," says Fletcher-Watson. "They are talking about single-gene causes of intellectual disability, perhaps many of whom are also autistic. But there is funding available for research to address autism, active parent campaign groups and all sorts of resources, in a way that there is not for intellectual disability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At the same time, Fletcher-Watson is more optimistic about the potential of genetic research to devise novel treatments for some of the co-occurring conditions with which autistic people are often diagnosed, including &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1525505019304949" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;epilepsy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.lww.com/jopn/fulltext/2015/10040/autism_and_sleep_disorders.2.aspx" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;sleep disturbances&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11920-017-0846-y" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;OCD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.lww.com/hrpjournal/fulltext/2014/03000/gastrointestinal_issues_in_autism_spectrum.5.aspx" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;gastrointestinal disorders&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Bourgeron now coordinates &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.r2d2-mh.eu/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;a European project&lt;/a&gt; on risk, resilience and developmental diversity in mental health, collaborating with autistic people and their families to better understand why autism rarely comes in isolation, and what makes different individuals prone to these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At the same time, Bourgeron says that we also need to better recognise neurodiversity and reduce stigma relating to autism. "I think that for us as geneticists we need to go back to the needs of each person" he says. "Some autistic individuals with Shank3 mutations are so severely impacted that they need round the clock care. For others, they might only need specific support at school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Overall, we need to do a better job of recognising neurodiversity, and doing everything we can to make sure that people who function differently from the majority can flourish in our societies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="facebook" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="x" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="instagram" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b id="." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 09:05:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxPTFNLQUg0MHJMdkd0T0FBMzRCc1I1eGVVS1RXYkVVY0xGX0taazVuQjV1MGpHc0p3RFdib3M2Q29TQXVqejIzWi1SZE5fUV9lQUd1ZkZyTjlYUzJsbWhwblNSY2cwNkpuMElLTVVjYmtCR09abEdZZXhVWTRvcDZUQS1PcWZMTWJWNV9ablh6OFM2alBBMGZ4UlhpUDczQQ</guid></item><item><title>芬太尼死亡缓慢，冰毒来到缅因州--《纽约时报》 | As Fentanyl Deaths Slow, Meth Comes for Maine - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE5uRmo1NjhXLWFWMmZUNE9IVWNoQldraTMtaGNSSVMwdkd1Sks3cmZnMkN3VnhBd2dDbWwtSDJjT2YtTVVMdFpQS1RYcGdwdkFsQ3BPel9YRDZ1a2VsVnZ0VW9QYWM4c0YyZFlwcUQ5UzF2d011?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Something worrisome was happening at Spurwink, a mental health clinic in Portland, Maine.

Two unvaccinated children in Texas and an unvaccinated &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-new-mexico-resident-tests-positive-death-rcna195231" target="_blank"&gt;adult in New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; have died. The adult tested positive for measles, but the official cause of death is still under investigation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. David Sugerman, a senior scientist leading the CDC’s measles response, said Tuesday at a meeting of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee that more than 90% of the cases are “related to the Southwest outbreak, driven by transmission in close-knit, undervaccinated communities.” The other cases have largely been imported from other countries, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We do believe that there’s quite a large amount of cases that are not reported and underreported,” Sugerman said Tuesday as he updated the committee on measles. “In working very closely with our colleagues in Texas; in talking with families, they may mention prior cases that have recovered and never received testing, other families that may have cases and never sought treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Sugerman said the CDC has deployed 15 people to Texas to help manage the outbreak and is sending seven more this week. It continues to make measles vaccines available to health departments at their request, he said, and it is helping standardize and expand wastewater surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-pulling-back-11b-covid-funding-sent-health-departments-us-rcna198006" target="_blank"&gt;slashed $11.4 billion in Covid funding&lt;/a&gt; last month, some of which helped state health departments respond to disease outbreaks. Sugerman said the loss of Covid grant money has created “funding limitations” in Texas, where state officials are redirecting staffers to work on the measles response or moving them from other regions to help support efforts in the outbreak area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We are scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions,” Sugerman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;As of Tuesday, 561 cases had been confirmed in the West Texas outbreak, according to the state’s &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;Department of State Health Services&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Each measles case may cost $30,000 to $50,000 to address, which “adds up quite quickly,” Sugerman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Before this year, the United States had not had a measles death in a decade, and a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5331a3.htm#" target="_blank"&gt;child had not died of measles&lt;/a&gt; since 2003. Many public health experts have &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-texas-rfk-jr-response-vaccines-doctors-wary-rcna194510" target="_blank"&gt;criticized Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s approach&lt;/a&gt; to the outbreak. While Kennedy has called for people to get the measles vaccine, he has framed vaccination as a personal choice and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-draws-misinformation-playbook-touting-inhaled-steroid-treat-me-rcna200085" target="_blank"&gt;emphasized unproven treatments&lt;/a&gt; like steroids or antibiotics. He has also repeatedly &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/health-secretary-rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-falsely-claims-wanes-rcna200636" target="_blank"&gt;claimed that immunity from measles vaccines wanes quickly&lt;/a&gt;, despite robust evidence that two doses of the vaccine offer lifelong protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At a media event Tuesday in Indiana, Kennedy said the CDC has “done a very good job at controlling the measles outbreak,” &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/rfk-jr-pushes-fluoride-policy-review-cites-autism-concerns-237047877801" target="_blank"&gt;pointing to higher case numbers in Europe&lt;/a&gt;. However, the figure he cited — 127,000 cases — was &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/13-03-2025-european-region-reports-highest-number-of-measles-cases-in-more-than-25-years---unicef--who-europe" target="_blank"&gt;the total last year across 53 countries&lt;/a&gt;. Disease experts say that is an apples-to-oranges comparison with the current outbreak in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy also suggested Tuesday that “healthy children should not die of measles” if doctors know how to treat it. In reality, no specific treatment is approved for measles, and unvaccinated children are vulnerable to severe complications, such as pneumonia and swelling of the brain. Roughly 1 to 3 out of every 1,000 children with measles die from respiratory and neurological complications, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC’s vaccine advisory committee met Tuesday for the first time since Kennedy took office on Feb. 13. The meeting was originally scheduled for late February, but &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-vaccine-committee-meeting-kennedy-postponed-hhs-rcna191659" target="_blank"&gt;the Department of Health and Human Services postponed it&lt;/a&gt;. A senior HHS spokesperson said at the time that the delay was intended to allow time for public comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy has previously &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/newly-sworn-in-hhs-secretary-rfk-jr-vows-tackle-physical-well-spiritual-crisis-country" target="_blank"&gt;accused the committee members&lt;/a&gt; of having conflicts of interest, citing ties to the pharmaceutical industry. Most scientists say it is appropriate for members to accept industry funding for vaccine research, as long as it is disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Helen Keipp Talbot, who chaired the committee Tuesday, lamented that the group had to discuss rising measles case numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“I find it absolutely devastating that we’re having this update today,” she said. “There’s no reason why we have healthy children dying of measles in the U.S. when this vaccine is amazing. It’s highly effective and has a very long-lasting immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxNT1U3NlM3UG53MWY0TWt5ZDZ0SjVpZENjandDaTl1RU42NzRSQU83aXF2NC1pSGxqM25RWC1oZFotbUYxdHNZOWN5Wi1oUGxac1Bkc2FPU3ZfWDl4TzNpZkNUai1UaU1pNUdZT2k2NE53NTBxb1lTZF9sOXE2TVBBcmMtc08xMzVleXdJd3RkVUZSUGVXa3hGZ9IBVkFVX3lxTFBFOVlhUXUxTVo5dXEwWlgtQ0NydHdxRzlET2tqdHRka2RTUXBOUVVNSm4xTmdob1JMclhxS0hBaDc1cl94c0VfNnpBT21PeHdZTWdFOUdR</guid></item><item><title>癌症幸存者医生分享了每天可以做的4件事，以大幅降低癌症风险-印度时报 | Cancer survivor doctor shares 4 things one can do daily to sharply reduce cancer risk - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it: when you hear the word cancer, it instantly sends a shiver down your spine. It’s one of those scary health topics no one really wants to think about, but deep down, we all wonder, “Am I doing enough to protect myself?” You don’t need to flip your life upside down or live in a bubble to reduce your cancer risk. There are small, super doable things you can start doing today that actually make a big difference over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, a cancer doctor Dr Amy Morris, who herself is a cancer survivor shared 4 essential things one must do in order to stay cancer free. In a video, shared on her Instagram account, Dr Morris says, "As a cancer thriver, you’ve already done so much to get rid of cancer. Chemo, Surgery, Radiation. But now that all of that is done, you are likely wondering how do you STAY cancer free?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Morris talks about habits that are easy, natural, and can even make you feel happier, more energetic, and just... better. These four daily habits may sound basic, but together, they pack a punch when it comes to long-term protection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Have you made any changes to your alcohol consumption for health reasons?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Walk like it matters&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking. Sounds almost too simple, right? But regular walking—like even 30 minutes a day, can dramatically reduce your risk for certain cancers, especially breast, colon, and endometrial cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking helps maintain a healthy weight. Fat cells don’t just sit there; they produce hormones and inflammation that can fuel cancer. It improves digestion, meaning things move along faster in your gut (hello, reduced colon cancer risk). It boosts your immune system, which is your body's personal security guard against rogue cancer cells. You don’t have to power walk or wear fancy shoes. Just sneak it in: take phone calls while walking, park a bit further, or stroll after dinner. And yes, 10-minute walks three times a day are just as good as one long walk. It's the movement that matters!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eat half a plate of veggies every day&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve all heard "eat your vegetables" since kindergarten—but this simple advice may be one of your strongest cancer-fighting tools. Why half a plate? Because when veggies take up that much space, they naturally crowd out the less healthy stuff—like refined carbs and fatty meats. More color, less cancer risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cruciferous veggies (like broccoli, cabbage) are loaded with sulforaphane—a natural compound shown to fight cancer cells. Leafy greens are packed with antioxidants and folate, which help repair damaged cells. Fiber in vegetables keeps your gut happy and reduces the risk of colon cancer. Add spinach or grated carrots to your dal or roti dough. Top toast with avocado or cucumber. Toss whatever’s in the fridge into a stir-fry—no recipe needed. And no, it doesn’t have to be expensive. Even humble okra, pumpkin, or bottle gourd have their own protective superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Live with a purpose&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one might sound a little too much to follow, but it’s legit: people who feel like they have a sense of purpose—something meaningful that gets them out of bed—tend to have lower inflammation, stronger immune function, and better long-term health. Living with purpose doesn’t mean you need to start a foundation or move to the mountains. It can be as simple as volunteering once a month, spending time with people who matter, growing a garden, creating something—art, music, a little blog or just waking up with an intention beyond the to-do list. When your life feels meaningful, your stress levels go down—and that’s huge, because chronic stress can weaken your immune system, mess with hormones, and even encourage cell mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Limit alcohol&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol—even in small amounts—can increase the risk of several cancers, including breast, liver, mouth, and esophageal. Why? Alcohol turns into acetaldehyde in the body, a toxic chemical that can damage DNA and stop cells from repairing themselves. That’s literally the start of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not ready to quit? Have alcohol-free weekdays. Switch to smaller glasses. Sip slowly and space out drinks with water. Even cutting down a little can reduce your risk. It’s not about perfection—it’s about progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cancer prevention isn’t about fear&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s about empowerment. These daily choices won’t just reduce your cancer risk—they’ll improve your quality of life right now. More energy. Better sleep. Stronger immunity. Sharper mood. And the best part? These aren’t fads or expensive supplements. They’re simple, sustainable habits that work with your lifestyle—not against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So take a walk. Eat your veggies. Follow your joy. Skip that second drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 08:53:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>神经科学说音乐是一台“情绪调节机器”。“以下是快乐、生产力或深度思维的玩法- Inc.com | Neuroscience Says Music Is an 'Emotion Regulation Machine.'

But the society’s band of dedicated amateurs leads mushroom expeditions almost every weekend year-round.

			&lt;p&gt;Medications designed to treat  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="157835" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; by lowering blood sugar levels, like Ozempic, continue to turn up added benefits, and protection from dementia may soon be added to the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 receptor agonists are a particular class of glucose-lowering drugs that can significantly &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-could-be-good-for-your-heart-even-if-you-dont-lose-weight"&gt;improve heart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprise-discovery-reveals-ozempic-lowers-risk-of-diabetic-kidney-disease"&gt;kidney health&lt;/a&gt; in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="157835" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;, and recent studies suggest they could also &lt;a href="http://sciencealert.com/type-2-diabetes-drug-linked-to-35-lower-dementia-risk-in-patients"&gt;reduce dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's an appealing prospect when an estimated 6.9 million US adults are living with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="157835" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; and related dementias today &lt;span&gt;– &lt;/span&gt;a number that is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.13809"&gt;expected to more than double&lt;/a&gt; by 2060.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already know &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/managing-the-risk-of-dementia/reduce-your-risk-of-dementia/diabetes"&gt;diabetes is a risk factor for dementia&lt;/a&gt;, and that people with diabetes are &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9812-diabetes-and-stroke"&gt;more likely to experience strokes&lt;/a&gt; from blood clots in the brain, which are known to sometimes result in &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/dementia/vascular-dementia"&gt;vascular dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"But whether glucose-lowering therapies can help prevent cognitive decline has remained unclear," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1079757"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Catriona Reddin, a medical researcher from the University of Galway. "Our findings suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonists, in particular, may have a protective effect on brain health."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study Reddin worked on was led by University of Galway medical students Allie Seminer and Alfredi Mulihano. A second, separate study from a University of Florida team was led by &lt;span&gt;epidemiologist &lt;/span&gt;Huilin Tang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both teams studied how glucose-lowering drugs with cardiovascular benefits, like GLP-1 agonists and &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGLT2_inhibitor"&gt;SGLT2 inhibitors&lt;/a&gt;, were associated with risk of cognitive impairment and dementia, specifically in people with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seminer's team analyzed the results of 26 randomized clinical trials, equating to more than 160,000 participants, which compared dementia diagnoses or cognitive scores among people who took glucose-lowering therapies, and those who didn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found people who used GLP-1RAs had a 45 percent lower risk of all-cause dementia and cognitive impairment, though this was not the case for those using &lt;span&gt;SGLT2is&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on closer inspection of dementia subtypes, these therapies had no association with lowering &lt;span&gt;vascular dementia, Alzheimer disease, or Lewy body dementia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;This is surprising because we would expect first-line cardioprotective glucose-lowering therapies, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;like GLP1-RAs and SGLT2is, which reduce cardiovascular dis- ease risk, to also decrease the risk of vascular dementia," University of California San Francisco medical doctor Diana Thiara &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2831981"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; in an editorial published alongside the papers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second study, led by Tang, was a target trial emulation using records from &lt;span&gt;396,963 patients with type 2 diabetes. The researchers analyzed the risk of Alzheimer's and related dementias, comparing results for people who used GLP-1RAs and those taking &lt;span&gt;SGLT2is or other kinds of glucose-lowering therapies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study found  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/p-value" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73101" data-postid="157835" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;statistically significant&lt;/a&gt; risk reductions in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias among people who used cardioprotective glucose-lowering therapies, regardless of whether they were &lt;span&gt;GLP-1RAs or SGLT2is. This was not the case for other kinds of glucose-lowering therapies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results support the potential neuroprotections of GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is and highlight their possible role in Alzheimer's and related dementia prevention strategies," Tang and team &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2831976"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thiara points out that both papers were limited by short follow-up durations, low dementia rates, confounding factors that muddy observational studies, and the broad strokes taken in classifying these drugs, which may contain different active ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"W&lt;span&gt;ith the advent of more potent GLP-1RAs, like semaglutide, it is crucial to study these newer medications individually rather than grouping them with older drugs in the same class, as their effects may differ significantly," she &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2831981"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The papers are published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2831975"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2831976"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0mizw000v26m57jmugf5e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Depression is becoming more common among adults and adolescents in the United States, but most are not getting therapy to help, according to a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da00043b6o2k64woud@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than 1 in 8 people ages 12 and up in the US have been depressed in recent years, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db527.htm" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday by the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. Depression prevalence has nearly doubled, from 7.3% in 2015-16 to more than 13% in 2021-23.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da00053b6opelhwd1w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The findings are based on results from a federal survey – most recently conducted between August 2021 and August 2023 – in which participants reported whether they had had certain symptoms associated with depression in the previous two weeks. Responses to these validated screening questions were scored to determine whether the individuals had depression.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j8yam000023b6o9uws7jui@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Covid-19 pandemic interrupted the administration of the survey, and modifications that were made once it resumed – including changes to the way it was administered – may have affected the ability to most accurately track changes over time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j8zmw100063b6o64q26p42@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People are less likely to report conditions that could potentially be considered socially undesirable in face-to-face interviews than they are in phone or online interviews, and changes in that method could account for increases, Dr. Renee Goodwin, a psychiatric epidemiologist and clinical psychologist with Columbia University, told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da00063b6o1xwvlt44@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, experts have long said that the pandemic&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;exacerbated mental health challenges for many in the US – 90% of adults have said that the country is facing a mental health crisis, according to a 2022 &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/health/cnn-kff-mental-health-poll-wellness/index.html"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; from CNN in partnership with KFF – but experts have also said that awareness around mental health has grown.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j92kmc000a3b6o51ex0ao6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Matt Mishkind, deputy director of the Johnson Depression Center at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, says that researchers have been trying to figure out why depression rates have been growing for the past decade or so – and at least part of it has to do with decreasing stigma around talking about mental health in some groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j99w2j000f3b6ohslbxr84@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The question then is, has that truly increased, or have we just been able to identify it more? I definitely think it has increased, and I think that’s because I think the world is a difficult place right now,” he said. “I think there’s been stressor after stressor after stressor for a long time now, and I think that is starting to truly affect people.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da00073b6ozkfwe6gf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the new CDC data, women are more likely than men to have depression, and prevalence tends to decrease with age and greater wealth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da00083b6otfkmkcsh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, about 16% of women and 10% of men had depression during the 2021-23 survey period. But more than 1 in 4 adolescent girls between ages 12 and 19 had depression, the data shows, higher than any other demographic group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da00093b6ope79rkny@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Data from the CDC’s latest Youth Risk Behavior Survey showed that more than half of high school girls (53%) said they felt persistently sad or hopeless – nearly twice the rate of share of boys (28%) who said the same and 14 percentage points higher than a decade earlier.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000a3b6o5wyxcy7a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Girls are more verbal and vocal about some of their challenges, traditionally; boys are not as much, although I think that is changing,” Dr. Jill Emanuele, vice president of clinical training at the Child Mind Institute in New York City, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/06/health/teen-mental-health-cdc-wellness/index.html"&gt;told CNN&lt;/a&gt; in August. She was not involved in any of the CDC reports.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000b3b6outqis0ym@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vast majority of adults and adolescents with depression in the latest survey – nearly 88% – said that symptoms had created difficulties for them in work, at home or with social activities, and about a third of those said it was “very to extremely difficult.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000c3b6ozezzfg8y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But only about 40% of adults and adolescents with depression received counseling or therapy, the new CDC report shows. Women were more likely than men to have received therapy: about 43%, compared with 33%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000d3b6okyl8824u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Adult women are also more than twice as likely as adult men to take medication for depression, according to another CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db528.htm" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday. In 2023, about 11.4% of US adults took a prescription medication for depression – but that breaks out to more than 15% of women and 7.4% of men.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000e3b6olhfsv6qn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite higher rates of depression in younger age groups, the new CDC reports show that middle-age people were more likely than younger adults to take prescription medication for depression. More than 12% of adults between ages 45 and 74 did so in 2023, compared with less than 11% of adults ages 18 to 44.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000f3b6o9x0fbnvv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has specifically targeted a certain class of antidepressant drugs in recent comments. At his Senate confirmation this year, he &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/28/health/rfk-jr-antidepressants-addictive-wellness/index.html"&gt;falsely suggested&lt;/a&gt; that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, may be more addictive than heroin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000g3b6o8cl3kztu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And the Trump administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishing-the-presidents-make-america-healthy-again-commission/" target="_blank"&gt;strategy&lt;/a&gt; for the Make America Healthy Again commission – which Kennedy will lead – specifically plans to address an assessment of the “prevalence of and threat posed by the prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors” for children, along with other mental health medications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000h3b6o7num9g5t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But in February, health care data and analytics company Truveta analyzed information from its database of millions of electronic health records to understand whether increased awareness around mental health has led to increases in people seeking medication or concerns around overprescribing or dependency on antidepressant medications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000i3b6oqeieg8rz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It found that trends in &lt;a href="https://www.truveta.com/blog/research/research-insights/mental-health-prescribing-trends/" target="_blank"&gt;prescriptions for mental health&lt;/a&gt; have remained relatively stable since 2018. Rates ticked up in the early years of the Covid-19 pandemic but have since dropped to levels from 2018 or lower.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000j3b6ogq92xjtn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Antidepressants are the most commonly prescribed mental health medication – with SSRIs accounting for nearly half – but Truveta found trends in prescribing rates to be much steadier than the CDC found in trends for depression prevalence. And the findings do not suggest that over-rescribing mental health medications should be a concern.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000k3b6oclz8jsl8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While increased mental health awareness and the heightened demand for care during the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to shifts in prescribing rates, our findings suggest that overall trends in mental health prescriptions have remained relatively stable, with only slight fluctuations in recent years,” Truveta researchers wrote in a blog post.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000l3b6orszvh5yi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While there was a slight increase in the rate of mental health prescriptions during the peak years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the subsequent stabilization and decrease suggests that the rise was likely a temporary response to heightened mental health needs rather than a long-term shift toward higher prescribing rates.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

Then, using a simulation, the team found that the warmth and weight of the sleeping child could increase the off-gassing of the toxicants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jane Houlihan, research director for Healthy Babies, Bright Futures, an alliance of nonprofits, scientists and donors dedicated to reducing babies’ exposures to neurotoxic chemicals revealed, “They found that even something as simple as a child’s body heat and weight on a mattress can increase the release of toxic chemicals into the air they breathe while sleeping – a factor that current safety standards don’t consider.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was not involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study did not include brand names, the researchers told CNN that they were well-known, lower-cost mattresses found at leading retail stores. Tested mattresses were purchased in Canada, but they contained materials from the United States and Mexico. Therefore, the results are likely to apply to mattresses purchased throughout North America, Diamond said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Houlihan informed CNN via an email, “The results show that parents can’t shop their way out of the problem. The mattresses tested emitted toxic chemicals regardless of their price, materials, or country of origin. And some contained additives above legal limits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Chemistry Council, which represents the US chemical, plastic and chlorine industry, told CNN via email that its members take safety seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Flanagin, the group’s senior director of product communications, said, “The use of flame retardant chemistries can be critical in situations where an accidental spark or short-circuited wire turns into a flame.” He added, “While we will need time to review the study in detail, the mere presence of a chemistry is not an indication of risk or adverse effect. Today, any chemistry introduced or imported into the U.S. must undergo rigorous review and approval processes by federal agencies, such as EPA and FDA.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chemicals in mattresses:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mattresses Can Be a Major Source of Harmful Chemicals in Kids' Rooms. Studies have tested for phthalates, flame retardants, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What are these chemicals?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Phthalates:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Phthalates are a group of chemicals used to make plastics more flexible and durable. They are also used as solvents and stabilizers in many consumer products. These are found in hundreds of consumer products, such as food storage containers, shampoo, makeup, perfume, and children’s toys, and are known to interfere with the body’s mechanism for hormone production, known as the endocrine system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, they are linked with early puberty, reproductive issues and genital defects, hormone issues, and other problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diamond quoted, “Our study we found high levels of phthalates that are restricted in toys but not in mattresses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences states on its website, even small hormonal disruptions can cause “significant developmental and biological effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children are especially vulnerable to the disruptive impact of chemicals due to their rapidly developing brains and bodies. Exposure to phthalates has been linked to increased risks of allergic diseases, behavioral problems, and potentially even developmental delays or disorders like autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per research, phthalates can trigger reproductive problems, such as genital malformations and undescended testes in baby boys and lower sperm counts and testosterone levels in adult males. Studies have also linked phthalates to childhood obesity, asthma, cardiovascular issues, premature deaths, and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Banned flame retardants:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are flame retardants linked to significant intellectual disability in children, resulting in a loss of 162 million IQ points and over 738,000 cases from 2001 to 2016, according to a January 2020 study. While some PBDEs were banned by the EPA in 2012, replacements like organophosphate esters (OPFRs) have emerged, associated with reproductive and developmental issues in toddlers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research indicates that OPFRs are used widely and may pose health risks, particularly to children. In one study, mattresses contained high levels of harmful chemicals, including TDCPP, a carcinogen, and PCTP, a banned flame retardant in both Canada and for children’s sleepwear in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some states, such as California, with its passage of Prop 65, regulators have put additional limitations in place on products marketed for children, but no national law covering classes of flame retardants exists, despite a 2017 report by the US Consumer Products Safety Commission on the dangers of organophosphate esters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study co-author Arlene Blum, executive director of the Green Science Policy Institute, a group of scientists and policy experts who work and report on chemicals of concern, said via a statement, “It’s concerning that these chemicals are still being found in children’s mattresses even though we know they have no proven fire-safety benefit and aren’t needed to comply with flammability standards,” adding, “Parents should be able to lay their children down for sleep knowing they are safe and snug.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the healthier alternative?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potentially toxic chemicals are so widespread in children’s products that it can be very hard for parents to choose safer options. However, in the case of mattresses, switching to good old cotton mattresses is a healthier option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cotton mattresses can be a healthier alternative to chemical mattresses, particularly those made with polyurethane foam. Cotton is a natural fiber, making it a good choice for those seeking a more environmentally friendly and breathable option. However, cotton mattresses have some drawbacks, like their tendency to compress and lose shape over time, which can negatively impact spinal alignment and support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Advantages of cotton mattresses:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Natural and hypoallergenic:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cotton is a natural fiber, making it a hypoallergenic option that is less likely to cause allergies or skin irritations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Breathable:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cotton allows air circulation, which can help regulate body temperature and promote a more restful sleep, especially in hot climates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Eco-friendly:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cotton is a renewable resource, making it a more environmentally friendly choice compared to some synthetic materials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Affordable:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cotton mattresses are generally more affordable than some other types, such as memory foam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Scientists find that brain cancer is linked to tissue healing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 03:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAJBVV95cUxQRTNZeVlIRGJ6cVExbzdZOVhEMzVZVTI3eXROTzhhaU1sMk1DQ2tVcWhUVDdQdkFZVnR4TlROc29vVVhrbk9jSFFKWHVuMHEtb3BRWjBEd25TTDZmTi1vQTExSjIzZzRLMlVHRk9mQVlqZmZRQmNwMWtzUzM3SVJkaWNtV1gybUMtRjExRTVsZXFvZF9McHc3WHZJWEhQOFZLZ3ctMEQ0VnRhcDdvUDcyQmlNV2E0S3NIR3J2QkMtM2puaHNQM0JzdXNOM0UxZHY5SWNYU1RHMlhjaHBLMTNoWjNJZ05oak1yYTNBdU5uNWhpRjRPZ2w3cVFELXpWNEFLaFFSc3RhRVhuNzN6S2lTTA</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，低维生素D水平通过超氧化物激增损害勃起健康-新闻-医学 | Low vitamin D levels damage erectile health via superoxide surge, study finds - News-Medical</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwgFBVV95cUxNV1NlUkdwOVhZeDMzbjlnSk9EeWZRelk3U21kbVFaTWxRY0dvZHh1WlJaN0xZdVdEV2FZOXNXQ1ZKb1k1bEhSQ3JyZEhaNkFUdUVoZEhvSXdhRVBxU0RYOV81dGc2bnNfQ196YlljWkNSX3RvV3BlbDR0cTRvc092c1MyX1BkZ2hfMnBIeXBtUUJKVjdfVWJXQmJ0VWUya0pFdk0zUnZ2ejczVF9xQVk3QzdJZHdMUTJseTJrUWlUNzdxUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="body-beac07bc-543d-433b-9e85-0fbb8bdb3396" class="page-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low vitamin D doesn’t just weaken bones; it can sabotage sexual health, disrupt key biological defenses, and make common ED treatments less effective, according to new research.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Image Credit: Lightspring / Shutterstock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent study published in the &lt;a href="https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bph.70034" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;British Journal of Pharmacology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, researchers found that vitamin D deficiency induces erectile dysfunction (ED). ED is a highly prevalent condition, affecting 52% of males aged 40–70 in the United States (US) and 30% of European males aged 40–79. It adversely affects the quality of life and is recognized as a marker of poor health. Notably, ED is an independent predictor of future stroke and myocardial infarction. Further, metabolic diseases, diabetes, and obesity are known risk factors for sexual dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D has physiological functions beyond phosphorus and calcium homeostasis, such as regulating cell growth, immunity, and intracellular metabolism. Vitamin D deficiency is widespread, affecting over half the global population. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is higher in ED patients. Besides, ED severity is associated with plasma levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D; however, the cause-and-effect relationship is unclear. While previous epidemiological studies have identified this association, the underlying mechanisms and direct causality, particularly in humans, have remained uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About the study&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the present study, researchers investigated whether isolated human corpora cavernosa (CC) from donors with vitamin D deficiency exhibit impairments in erectile function. Blood and cavernosal samples were obtained from 12 organ donors. It is important to note that while these ex vivo human tissue experiments are not influenced by hormonal or psychological factors, the sample size is relatively small, and the findings in humans are observational in nature. Further, a pilot study was performed in CC from Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats fed a standard or vitamin D-free diet for five months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D receptor (Vdr) knockout mice were generated and used at four months of age. These mice were fed a γ-irradiated diet containing 20% lactose, 2% calcium, and 1.25% phosphorus to normalize mineral ion levels in the blood. Human CC strips were mounted and stretched to optimal isometric tension, and an initial response to 80 mM potassium chloride was recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mobile-middle-mrec-promo-spot" class="mobile-promo-wrap mobile-promo-mrec"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further, neurogenic relaxations to electrical field stimulation (EFS) were obtained. Penile small helicine arterial rings were dissected and mounted on microvascular wire myographs for isometric tension recordings. Arteries were contracted with noradrenaline, and relaxation was measured by adding acetylcholine. Rat and mouse CC strips were placed in wire myographs and stretched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Animal CC strips were incubated with atropine and guanethidine to inhibit muscarinic receptors and adrenergic neurotransmission and contracted with phenylephrine. EFS or vasoactive agents induced relaxations. Further, CC strips were transfected with specific small-interfering RNA (siRNA) against secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (Slpi) and control non-targeting siRNA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mice and rats were anesthetized for intra-cavernosal pressure (ICP) measurement in the right cavernous nerve. Testosterone, SLPI, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in rat and human plasma. Further, total RNA was extracted for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Findings&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many donors had reduced responses to EFS in CC and moderately or severely reduced 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Notably, there were marked differences between participants with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels below and above the cohort median value (35.5 nM). However, plasma testosterone levels were not correlated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Due to the small sample size, this lack of correlation with testosterone in humans should be interpreted with caution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In rats fed a vitamin D-free diet, the reduction in 25-hydroxyvitamin D, without plasma calcium changes, significantly decreased EFS-induced relaxation. This vitamin D deficiency also significantly reduced acetylcholine-induced nitric oxide (NO)-dependent relaxation. Moreover, the relaxation induced by the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor (PDE5i) sildenafil (the first-choice drug for ED) was reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the relaxation induced by riociguat, the soluble guanylyl cyclase stimulator, was unchanged. Besides, a vitamin D-free diet feeding significantly reduced 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in plasma from Wistar rats. However, testosterone levels were unaffected. Notably, vitamin D deficiency markedly reduced the EFS-induced increase in ICP in anesthetized rats. CC strips isolated from vitamin D-deficient rats showed reduced EFS- and sildenafil-induced relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mobile-bottom-mrec-promo-spot" class="mobile-promo-wrap mobile-promo-mrec"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The study also found that vitamin D deficiency in rats led to increased penile fibrosis, as indicated by greater collagen deposition in penile tissue. Penile cavernous fibrosis is considered an important factor contributing to ED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, the increase in ICP to EFS was lower in Vdr knockout mice than in wild-type mice, confirming ED. CC isolated from Vdr knockout mice showed reductions in EFS- and sildenafil-induced relaxations, but there were no changes in response to riociguat. Further experiments indicated that VDR ablation—and vitamin D deficiency-induced ED was mediated by increased superoxide production.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Transcriptomic analysis showed up- and down-regulation of several genes in vitamin D-deficient rats. Among these, Slpi was downregulated in CC from vitamin D-deficient rats. Notably, human donors with vitamin D deficiency also had reduced plasma SLPI. Finally, CC strips from healthy rats were incubated with SLPI or vehicle and exposed to pyrogallol (superoxide generator) with or without the superoxide scavenger, PEGylated superoxide dismutase (PEGSOD).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the relaxant responses to EFS were absent due to neural degeneration, only concentration-response curves to diethylamine NONOate (DEA-NO), an NO donor, were analyzed. Expectedly, pyrogallol diminished responses to DEA-NO due to the reaction of NO with superoxide. However, preincubation with SLPI alone did not modify the response to DEA-NO, but SLPI was able to partially reverse the reduction in relaxation caused by pyrogallol, indicating a protective effect against superoxide-induced ED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, PEGSOD prevented pyrogallol-induced ED. Slpi silencing in CC strips from healthy rats resulted in the downregulation of Slpi at levels comparable to those observed in vitamin D-deficient rats. Further, Slpi silencing significantly reduced the relaxant response to DEA-NO, implying that SLPI was necessary for erectile function. Notably, PEGSOD reverted the inhibitory effect of Slpi silencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, the findings illustrate that vitamin D deficiency or ablation of the Vdr gene induces ED via increased superoxide and SLPI downregulation. Moreover, the results implicate vitamin D deficiency as an etiological factor for vascular ED and in the therapeutic failure of PDE5i. While these results suggest that improving vitamin D status in patients with ED and vitamin D deficiency could potentially enhance calcium metabolism, bone health, sexual performance, and ED treatment &lt;a href="/health/What-Does-Efficacy-Mean.aspx" class="linked-term"&gt;efficacy&lt;/a&gt;, the authors emphasize that further clinical studies are needed, and the direct applicability to humans requires additional research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mobile-bottom-promo-spot" class="mobile-promo-wrap mobile-promo-leaderboard-320"&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON — A new report from Harris County Health shows cases of &lt;a href="/article/news/health/breakthrough-hiv-prevention-join-the-discussion-on-prep-on-khou-11/285-321bdc5f-8385-4cc0-97ff-62da54c59090" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; and other sexually transmitted infections are rising throughout the &lt;a href="/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Houston area at a faster rate&lt;/a&gt; than any other place in Texas. The rates of new infections are even rising among diseases you may have forgotten about.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia all of them," says Legacy Health's director of health navigation, Jill Jahns. "It's a big issue we have here in our community. Harris County and Houston in particular have been surpassing the rates of STIs in Texas."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the lag for required reporting, the most recent data in the report covers the time period between 2016 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Between 2016 and 2022, the rates of syphilis in our community doubled," Jahns says. "Which is definitely concerning."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report includes a map of the zip codes where the rate of syphilis is the highest. The parts of the Houston area with the highest rates are: Downtown, Montrose and the OST area, in that order.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For chlamydia, the highest rates of new cases are located in the Medical Center area, La Porte and Downtown.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The ages we're seeing it the highest is ages 15 through 24," Jahns said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study shows gonorrhea has an infection rate that is surging in the Medical Center area, followed by Downtown and then Sunnyside.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highest rates of new HIV cases were seen in Montrose, followed by the Second Ward and then Settegast.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the sexually transmitted infections are found in basically every demographic in Harris County, the study found there is one population that is testing positive for them at a faster rate than others.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Particularly Black women," Jahns said. "Black women who are heterosexual are frequently getting STIs at a higher rate than other groups."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best place to start is from a position of knowledge. &lt;a href="https://www.legacycommunityhealth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Legacy Health&lt;/a&gt; offers free and confidential HIV and STI testing and some results are returned in minutes. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of Houston's most prevalent STIs can be treated with medication, &lt;a href="/article/news/health/breakthrough-hiv-prevention-join-the-discussion-on-prep-on-khou-11/285-321bdc5f-8385-4cc0-97ff-62da54c59090" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;including HIV, which no longer has to deliver a death sentence&lt;/a&gt;. Houston's HIV positive patients are given medication at Legacy Health to not only survive but also drugs that keep the active virus in their bodies low enough, to protect somebody else.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

From bone pain to medical conditions, low vitamin D is a problem worth tending to ASAP. The good news? There are a few easy ways to keep those levels in check. Below, the experts break down everything you need to know about vitamin D, along with their best advice for getting enough vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is vitamin D good for the body?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/foods-high-in-vitamin-d" target="_blank"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.instagram.com/jennastangland/?hl=en" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.instagram.com/jennastangland/?hl=en"}' href="https://www.instagram.com/jennastangland/?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Jenna Stangland&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, registered dietician and performance advisor for &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.livemomentous.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.livemomentous.com/"}' href="https://www.livemomentous.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Momentous&lt;/a&gt;, explains, is a hormone that our body can synthesize from UV light. Stangland says it has numerous functions in our body and comes with many benefits. Optimal vitamin D levels are essential for systemic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It regulates cellular growth and gene expression (essential for cancer prevention), improves cell differentiation, and is involved in immunity, fertility, muscle strength, hormone balance, sexual health, energy, mood, and more,” adds &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.instagram.com/rhianstephenson/?hl=en" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.instagram.com/rhianstephenson/?hl=en"}' href="https://www.instagram.com/rhianstephenson/?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Rhian Stephenson&lt;/a&gt;, nutritionist, naturopath, and founder of &lt;a data-offer-url="https://artah.co/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://artah.co/"}' href="https://artah.co/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Artah&lt;/a&gt;. Put simply, it’s essential for all-around health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happens if you’re vitamin D deficient?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D deficiency impacts both physical and mental health. When vitamin D is low, Stangland explains that there is decreased absorption of calcium and phosphorus into the bones, which puts you at risk of bone fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/how-to-get-vitamin-d"&gt;Low levels&lt;/a&gt; are also linked to poor immunity and increased risk of serious health conditions such as cancer. “Vitamin D has been shown to play a role in cancer prevention and treatment,” she explains. “[It] inhibits cell proliferation in cancerous tissues and also downregulates certain cells involved in inflammatory signaling in cancer.” Other poor outcomes include autoimmune conditions, COVID-19, hormone health, and mood disorders, Stephenson. Hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, fibromyalgia, and neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, are all also linked to vitamin D deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who eat a vegan diet or who have celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, and cystic fibrosis are particularly at risk of vitamin D deficiency. Others who are at risk are babies who are breastfed, older adults, those with dark skin tones, and those who weigh above their standard body mass index (BMI). According to the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;National Institutes of Health (NIH)&lt;/a&gt;, breast milk’s vitamin D levels are lower than the required amounts and also dependent on the mother’s vitamin D levels. When it comes to older people or those with darker skin tones, the NIH explains that our skin has a harder time synthesizing vitamin D as we age or if we have melanin in the epidermal layer that reduces the skin’s ability to do so. Those who may be dealing with excess fat won’t necessarily have a problem absorbing vitamin D, but the NIH says that they will need more of it to be sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms of vitamin D deficiency?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only way to truly know if you are vitamin D deficient is to have a blood test via your general practitioner. However, there are also signs and symptoms you can look out for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Fatigue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you have a severe vitamin D deficiency, one of the most common symptoms is a feeling of chronic, profound, or irremediable fatigue. To add to that, poor sleep is another symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Bone and muscle pain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies have shown a correlation between vitamin D deficiency and frequent muscle pain and weakness. Meanwhile, bone and joint pain are common, as vitamin D is essential for the body to absorb calcium—without it, increased fragility and pain may occur. So for the sake of your bone health, vitamin D is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Hair loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s essential for healthy hair that grows optimally. A deficiency can cause hair to fall out or slow growth because a deficiency intervenes with a follicle’s life cycle. Alopecia is also believed to be related to vitamin D insufficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;You’re often sick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D deficiency is associated with a weak immune system. If you’re often ill and don’t know why, consider getting a blood test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Depression, anxiety, and mood disorders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific research shows that vitamin D may play a key role in balancing our mood and minimizing the risk of depression. Low levels can contribute to seasonal affective disorder and are often associated with feelings of being overwhelmed, sadness, anxiety, forgetfulness, and sadness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do you get vitamin D?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is well known that &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/serotonin-vitamin-d-daylight" target="_blank"&gt;sunlight exposure&lt;/a&gt; is the easiest way to stimulate the production of vitamin D in the body, which is why we’re particularly vulnerable to deficiency in the dark winter months. “The NHS recommends supplementing with vitamin D3 throughout autumn and the winter months for this reason,” explains Stephenson. Stangland recommends getting at least 20 minutes of sun exposure to keep vitamin D levels at a healthy amount. (Just be sure to always &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/vogue-editors-sunscreen" target="_blank"&gt;wear sunscreen&lt;/a&gt; to protect your skin from sun damage and to prevent skin cancer.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 23:26:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE96UWlpQWdrN2RQLW9EaHpVTXQwNE5qaktnZmVabnk4dGR1QzItYU16cTEwSDVEVEVGeGNPaTZ6Y05YajNDelR5dW1XR3prdk9tLVBuLW9xcmF3dXN4TDhz</guid></item><item><title>Waverly社区集会支持17岁儿童死于流感、链球菌并发症的家庭- 10tv.com | Waverly community rallies to support family after 17-year-old dies from flu, strep complications - 10tv.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi3gFBVV95cUxPMW1rSFYzMlNuV2xCZXdYQzRNUmNHTGxvd2xLMDZlWnphODV2ZjR0QUEtY1NMcTcxWkxXZm5hdXRyX1ZrQVRjZDFITFZPOUtlV2dWaFZJNU5WcU9QTXRNcEJnT2ZCNS1NTTNoQUtXRTBMN0lsSEZsWVBYTjhFYm9VQUtWcDc4MFFHRmNEWmFmVE12SFE5bnVQdWJoNU8yYVhlbUZuMnM0MjZLbXlibll6MjZpbHlaQWQ4LVdka0hTaml5YmlJUktTU1JfVE9NVmR1WEpJWEhNbFlndUV5V3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;Waverly mourns senior Jocey Tackett, who died from flu complications.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WAVERLY, Ohio — The Waverly High School community received the news this week that one of their own passed away after weeks in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, 17-year-old Jocey Tackett had been admitted to the hospital with the flu and suffered complications from the flu and strep that turned septic and caused too much damage for her body to recover, according to her family.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She passed away on Sunday at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, just a few days before she would have turned 18.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jocey was a senior at Waverly High School.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waverly City Schools shared a statement saying it was saddened about her passing.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our thoughts and condolences are with her family and all who were her friends. This is a very devastating and delicate situation, so out of respect and love for the family we did not want to schedule or release information that would possibly conflict with the family’s plans or wishes for privacy during this difficult time," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school will have counselors available in the high school auditorium from noon to 2 p.m. on April 17 for any students in need of additional support.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school is also planning on having the administration and staff meet with the high school student body in the auditorium on April 21.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the tragic loss, the small town community is working to support Jocey’s family.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 22, Giovanni’s Pizza of Piketon and Cardo’s in Lucasville will donate half their proceeds to the Tacketts.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giovanni’s owner Amanda Little wanted to do something to help.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are a really small community here that comes together in hard times. Devastating losses such as this are taken to heart by everyone, the death of anyone — especially a child — is just really heartbreaking,” Little said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little said she has known Jocey for most of her life.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She had a big personality and didn’t let the opinions of others influence her life. She was really passionate about animals, especially horses, she showed at the 4-H at our county fair for many years and she had planned to attend college and study zoology as well.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jocey’s mother suggests honoring her by giving blood or donating to an animal shelter.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ohio Department of Health could not comment specifically on Tackett, but shared there have been four flu related deaths in Ohio during the 2024-2025 flu season.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Getting an annual flu shot is the best way to protect yourself against the flu. ODH especially encourages parents to protect their children by ensuring they are up to date on their flu shot. Washing your hands frequently, covering any coughs or sneezes and staying home when you’re sick will also help prevent the spread of flu to others.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

						Measles has been diagnosed in an unvaccinated child in Dona Ana County, making it the first reported case there, a New Mexico Department of Health news release said.Dona Ana County residents may have been exposed to measles earlier this month in Las Cruces at the Kid's Kountry Place Preschool and Childcare and the Memorial Medical Center's Family Medicine Center, Emergency Department and Pediatric Unit.  There are now 63 cases of measles in New Mexico, counting four new cases in Lea County of people who have not received the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The disease has also been reported in Chaves and Eddy counties. With the number of cases increasing, the NMDOH is recommending that the MMR vaccine be given to infants from 6-11 months old who live in Dona Ana County, or will be traveling to Dona Ana and Lea counties.At the same time, the number of people getting vaccinations to prevent measles has almost doubled from Feb. 1 to April 4 over the same period last year — from 9,863 to 18,449 , the release said.Information on measles symptoms, and guidance from nurses, is available on the NMDOH helpline at 1-833-796-8773 and online at measles.doh.nm.gov.

Just over 6.5% of participants had a slow walking pace, 53% had an average walking pace and 41% had a brisk walking pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Tracking these individuals for an average of 13 years showed that 36,574 participants (9%) developed some form of heart rhythm abnormality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;After accounting for background demographic and lifestyle factors, an average or brisk walking pace was associated with, respectively, a 35% and 43% lower risk of all heart rhythm abnormalities compared with a slow walking pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;These higher walking speeds were also associated with lower risks of atrial fibrillation and other cardiac arrhythmias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While the amount of time spent walking at a slow pace was not associated with the risk of developing heart rhythm abnormalities, more time spent walking at an average or brisk pace was associated with a 27% lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Overall, around 36% of the association between walking pace and all heart rhythm abnormalities was influenced by metabolic and inflammatory factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Demographic and lifestyle factors accounted for by the study included that participants reporting a faster walking pace were more likely to be men and tended to live in less deprived areas and have healthier lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Atrial fibrillation is a condition where the heart’s upper chambers beat irregularly and too fast, while ventricular arrhythmias occur when an abnormal heart rhythm starts in the lower chambers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Heart rhythm problems can increase the risk of stroke, heart failure and cardiac arrest if left untreated. They can occur when there is a problem with the electrical system that makes the heart beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers noted that the study was observational, meaning that no firm conclusions could be drawn on whether walking at a brisk pace was a direct cause of a lower risk of heart rhythm abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study was also limited by the fact the participants were self reported and did not reflect a broad spectrum of ages and ethnic backgrounds. The average age was 55, 55% were women and 97% were white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers, led by Prof Jill Pell of the University of Glasgow, said: “This study is the first to explore the pathways underpinning the association between walking pace and arrhythmias, and to provide evidence that metabolic and inflammatory factors may have a role: walking faster decreased the risk of obesity and inflammation, which, in turn, reduced the risk of arrhythmia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This finding is biologically plausible because cumulative epidemiological studies have shown that walking pace is inversely associated with metabolic factors, such as obesity, HbA1c [fasting glucose], diabetes, and [high blood pressure] which, in turn, are associated with the risk of arrhythmias.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPdlBLQ3VFN0s5b2xCUFVHbGJsMzlINGRsa0g4X1RNMWJmaUJTOGhaa3RxY25fNVFySmRaX3A5cTlLMVlOSmY0TTcxN1FKYzJfQXdPMC1FaE1OTEF5VGpkRV84NWJpSFJQQTNqRDFmVHhMX0hmTEtIejZ6eHlxS3NDbjhjc1pTZGlrQlhjUEF2YXRzemh3Yy1POWNOZmpDX0t3RmZZX1RCZUpsSi1YeWpqMTBVeUx5YmFtX053</guid></item><item><title>“我们只是不确切知道它是什么” |乔治亚州中部兽医看到狗神秘疾病的增加- 13WMAZ | 'We just don't know exactly what it is' | Central Georgia vets seeing rise of mystery illness in dogs - 13WMAZ</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizgFBVV95cUxPWFJIZlZpRUFObi1jZzBKdHZ0RURIaVdjZGU0NXdjUjFWWVBzOGhLTkFHVzlXSnFhTHh3WmdjcDRrSUF5LVlFRmlZNjR3WmZHVEg2X1F2Sm5EV0psOHdZOEdrWjhWYk16R1d4ZVNIdXBxU0hxS1JvaG9NLVVWN2g5MG9iT0xXN0NZQWlocW9Bb2UtQ1QyVDRGbGl4dEQ2SkluMTYyRWNGZFlENS1BUU1xcll5dlpNSXRiemRpQWx3VmwzdmxDNFd1ZWg4Zi1Jdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;Veterinarians are alarmed by a rising unknown respiratory illness in dogs across Central Georgia. Here's what we found.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MACON, Ga. — A mysterious respiratory illness affecting dogs in &lt;a href="/local" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Central Georgia&lt;/a&gt; has veterinarians concerned as cases continue to rise.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Georgia Veterinary Medical Association has identified an unknown respiratory disease that has been circulating among dogs in the region, with a notable spike in cases over the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think because we just don't know exactly what it is and because if we cultured and took a swab of one dog that's not necessarily what it's gonna be for every dog," said Mary Frances Wylie, a veterinarian at Northside Wesleyan Animal Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wylie says that her clinic has treated approximately 15 dogs with the mysterious illness in the past two months alone.  She says the most common symptoms include a whooping cough-like condition and unusually low energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She says it is difficult to track exact numbers because the disease remains unidentified. What makes this illness particularly concerning is its resistance to standard treatments.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This illness doesn't respond as well to antibiotic treatments and sometimes requires several rounds of medication," according to the Georgia Veterinary Medical Association.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing of the outbreak she says appears to correlate with increased dog interactions at boarding facilities and daycare centers.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"More dogs go to boarding, grooming, day cares. We just had Spring Break, President's Day, so a lot of families go out of town," she said. "That's really when it becomes more prevalent is when dogs become in close proximity to each other."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The illness is airborne, making it difficult to avoid completely. However, she recommends preventative measures for concerned pet owners.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Really staying on top of your vaccines with your vet, talking to them about what vaccines that your dog needs and what they're at risk for, avoiding high traffic dog areas if you can help it," she said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most healthy dogs can safely continue normal activities, certain pets face higher risks.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you have an older dog with heart issues or breathing issues, those are the dogs that I would probably [be concerned about]," Dr. Wiley said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added that for these vulnerable animals, "maybe just with time and avoiding dog parks, daycares if you're worried" would be the safest approach.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She says that vaccination remains an important protective measure and hopes more pet owners will keep their animals' vaccines current as experts work to identify and combat this mysterious respiratory illness.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials continue to monitor the situation and urge dog owners to contact their veterinarians if their pets show symptoms of respiratory distress.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

UTA launches an interactive exhibit to raise awareness, showing how the virus spreads through one household.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARLINGTON, Texas — The number of measles cases in Texas continues to rise, with state health officials reporting 20 new infections in the past five days. That brings the total number of cases to 561 since late January, &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-outbreak-texas-updates-numbers-cases-dfw-dallas-everything-need-know/287-b3720460-9d97-4d3c-b646-f056c40a3807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;with nearly all involving unvaccinated or unknown vaccination status&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As concern grows, the University of Texas at Arlington is using education as a tool to fight misinformation and promote awareness. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College of Nursing and Health Innovation unveiled a new, interactive “Measles Outbreak Education Experience” inside its home health suite — a space surrounded by floor-to-ceiling windows that invite passersby to engage with the exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We wanted it to be very visible,” said Jennifer Roye, Assistant Dean for Simulation Technology. "It all stems from one of our employees who was taking a trip to the beach and wondered about measles transmission for her nine-month-old."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exhibit is designed to resemble a museum display, immersing visitors in a real-world outbreak scenario. Seven patient profiles within a single household are used to illustrate how quickly measles can spread.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One scenario includes patients like “Grandpa Miller,” a fictional cancer patient undergoing chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s a little immunocompromised,” Roye explained, emphasizing how vulnerable populations face heightened risks during an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QR codes deliver short, digital pamphlets covering prevention methods, symptoms, complications, and frequently asked questions.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students, staff, and members of the public are encouraged to explore the display and test their knowledge. Visitors are prompted to answer questions about risk factors and transmission. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a really fun way to have people interact and learn at the same time,” one student noted. “I think the displays are really nice.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As measles cases continue to rise, UTA’s exhibit offers both a timely reminder and a hands-on approach to public health education. It runs until May 9.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

Hanks had a case reported on Monday and Bel Air also had a case reported a few days ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials have initiated contact tracing to identify potential exposures and are coordinating with state partners to prevent further spread of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although approximately 98 percent of El Paso County residents are vaccinated against measles. Unvaccinated individuals remain at the highest risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RECOMMENDED&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://kfoxtv.com/news/local/measles-case-reported-in-dona-ana-county-1st-in-southeast-new-mexico?SRC=LINK" target="_blank" title="https://kfoxtv.com/news/local/measles-case-reported-in-dona-ana-county-1st-in-southeast-new-mexico?SRC=LINK" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Measles case reported in Doña Ana County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine (MMR) is highly effective but not 100% foolproof, health officials said. Two doses provide approximately 97% protection, meaning a small number of vaccinated individuals may still contract the virus—particularly during outbreaks or in cases of weakened immune response. However, vaccinated individuals who become infected are far less likely to experience serious complications or transmit the virus to others, according to health officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;POTENTIAL EXPOSURE LOCATIONS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who visited the following locations on the dates and times noted should verify their immunization status and monitor for symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DateLocationTime&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4/04/2025Walmart; 1850 Zaragoza4:45 p.m. – 7:45 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4/05/2025El Paso International Airport 6701 Convair8 a.m. – 11:20 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4/07/2025 El Paso International Airport 6701 Convair1:30 p.m. – 3:50 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4/04/2025Los Toreado 5331 Marcillus6:30 p.m. – 9:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who: (1) visited any of the locations above on the specified dates and times, and (2) develops a fever and rash, should contact their healthcare provider immediately for evaluation and testing.

When citizens identify ideologically with such leaders, they become more hostile toward political opponents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This polarization is driven not by opposing politicians but by the actions and rhetoric of the leaders they support. The findings suggest that emotionally manipulative leadership poses a threat to democratic norms and social cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dark Triad Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Politicians high in narcissism, psychopathy, or Machiavellianism intensify hostility among their supporters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supporter Identification:&lt;/strong&gt; The more voters identify with these leaders, the more polarized and hostile their views become.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democracy at Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; These traits can erode trust, reduce cooperation, and weaken democratic institutions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Amsterdam&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Politicians who exhibit ‘dark’ personality traits such as narcissism, psychopathy or Machiavellianism contribute to increasing affective polarisation among citizens. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the conclusion of a new study conducted by the University of Amsterdam (UvA), the University of Lausanne and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, recently published in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Political Research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108788"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a shadowy politician on a stage." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Remarkably, the personality traits of political opponents have little to no effect on the degree of polarisation. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers linked the personality profiles of over 90 prominent politicians worldwide with voter attitudes in 40 national elections. The results reveal striking patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politicians who score high on the so-called Dark Triad – narcissism (excessive self-focus), psychopathy (emotional coldness and lack of empathy), and Machiavellianism (a tendency toward manipulation and deception) – are associated with greater hostility toward political opponents among their followers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polarisation from within&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers show that dark traits have an effect when voters feel ideologically close to the politician in question. The stronger the identification, the more likely supporters are to adopt hostile stances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Machiavellian politicians in particular – strategic, manipulative, goal-driven – appear to be catalysts for affective polarisation: they deepen emotional divides between their supporters and others,’ explains Alessandro Nai, researcher at the UvA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remarkably, the personality traits of political opponents have little to no effect on the degree of polarisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nai: ‘We know today that voters tend to take cues from politicians they feel close to, and are more likely to ignore messages from politicians they disagree with. It is thus our own politicians who make us angrier, fuel hostile thinking towards others, and contribute to affective polarisation. And this can have dramatic consequences.’&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dominant leaders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included leaders such as Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro, Emmanuel Macron, Marine Le Pen, Angela Merkel, Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn, Boris Johnson, Viktor Orbán, Narendra Modi, Silvio Berlusconi, Shinzo Abe, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and many others. Dutch politicians such as Mark Rutte and Geert Wilders were also part of the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While no individual scores are disclosed, the researchers emphasise a broader trend: during times of political tension, voters tend to prefer dominant, hardline leaders, even when they exhibit norm-breaking or confrontational behaviour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democratic risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings cast a critical light on the global rise of ‘dark’ leaders. According to the researchers, the confrontational and uncompromising personality traits of such leaders pose clear risks to democratic processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘When the personal traits of leaders poison public discourse, the public’s willingness to cooperate weakens, social cohesion suffers, and ultimately democratic norms erode,’ says co-author Katjana Gattermann of the UvA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers call for greater awareness of the role (dark) personality plays in political leadership, in particular when these traits appear in strongmen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nai concludes: ‘We have shown in previous research that dark personality traits are particularly frequent in authoritarian leaders and populists; the evidence seems thus to be piling up that narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism are important phenomena if we want to understand why politics, today, seems so confrontational.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychology and politics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1d6d786f6e6b72726f71747e756974737a5d686b7c337371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Laura Erdtsieck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uva.nl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Laura Erdtsieck – University of Amsterdam&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-6765.70002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ripping the public apart?

Politicians’ dark personality and affective polarization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing evidence exists about the importance of dark personality traits – narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism – in political leaders, broadly leading to heightened political aggressiveness and partisan conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on this expanding research agenda, we study the possible association between dark personality in politicians and deepened affective polarization – that is, increased affective distance between partisan groups coupled with stronger dislike for out-parties – in the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do so by linking a large-scale expert survey (NEGex) and a collection of post-election surveys (CSES), including information for more than 90 leading candidates having competed in 40 elections worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results show that the dark personality of top politicians can be associated with upticks in affective polarization in the public – but only when it comes to the personality of in-party candidates (that is, a candidate from voters’ preferred party), and only for high levels of ideological proximity between the candidate and the voter.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 21:32:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE5IekhISGtsSFRYYkRfcjQ1RTlWOURQSlRpMjY1UkstY0xXbFJkamdYc2taTUV6OFg5ZDBsWTV4bV92R1dRbjFfVDV1TUVlRWJvdTlsWUlONE04bTVSTUpuSDhtR21EWXdsN0tKaWtUeE84OXgzMXdv</guid></item><item><title>科学所说的4种食物可以帮助你活到100岁-财富 | The 4 foods that science says can help you live to 100 - Fortune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE5BTFNIMFZITGlkLVBIVXZVdHEzaHJ3ZXlsMUEzd19qTkxEaHhYZGRFZFVuWGMzYWdmSmdXNFdRcURlRmZLeWVDR3lyMnRram1yd3ptQWlmSEg3MGRWSUhvTXpiY21DeXRudGZWN253?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fortune</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 21:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE5BTFNIMFZITGlkLVBIVXZVdHEzaHJ3ZXlsMUEzd19qTkxEaHhYZGRFZFVuWGMzYWdmSmdXNFdRcURlRmZLeWVDR3lyMnRram1yd3ptQWlmSEg3MGRWSUhvTXpiY21DeXRudGZWN253</guid></item><item><title>根据专家的说法，您可能需要更多这种维生素来防止记忆力减退-雅虎 | You May Need More of This Vitamin to Prevent Memory Loss, According to Experts - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxNcjJYdXdleUNTOWxBaHcyWDI2cGczcjNNam02OTdnX0JxVlNldHhsdDZub3lodU53SHk3SnBIQ2JxSElnSkJBc2dlNUp1eFhsZy1zTldnRUI3TTVRU29HTktXQnc0ZzZISktQRE8tUFJBRFFBSUhLQkFuLVFubDE1T04xbFQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;By now, you've likely been told to "&lt;a href="https://parade.com/849286/brendabennett/23-healthy-salads-that-will-make-you-want-to-eat-your-greens/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:eat your greens;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;eat your greens&lt;/a&gt;" for as long as you can remember&lt;br&gt;—and therefore assume you understand why you should: Because &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/heres-happens-body-eat-salad-114000919.html" data-ylk="slk:they're good for you.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;they're good for you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Yes, but that’s only a small part of the big picture.
