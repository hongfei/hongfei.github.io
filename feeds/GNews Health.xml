					&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev are now saying that while weight loss in middle age could help the waistline, it may also hurt the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that after diet-induced obesity in middle-aged mice, weight loss lowered blood glucose, which is a positive benefit. However, it also caused aggravated inflammation in the hypothalamus, a region in the brain that regulates appetite, energy balance and many other vital functions. Similar inflammation is known to be linked to cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimerâ€™s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study, led by MD-PhD student Alon Zemer and Dr. Alexandra Tsitrina at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, under the supervision of Faculty of Health Sciences Prof. Assaf Rudich of the Obesity Research Lab and Prof. Alon Monsonego of the Neuroimmunology Lab, recently appeared in the peer-reviewed journal, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-025-01933-x"&gt;Gero-Science.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p id="gpt-passback"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The unexpected findings raise new questions about how weight loss in midlife may impact brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â€œWeight loss remains essential for restoring metabolic health in obesity,â€� Zemer told The Times of Israel in a teleconference call with Rudich. â€œBut we need to understand the impact of weight loss on the mid-age brain and ensure brain health is not compromised.â€�&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="timesofisrael" data-from="Skinny on weight loss: Israeli researchers warn dieting in middle age may harm the brain"&gt;

	&lt;p class="newsletter-error newsletter-article-error"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
		
&lt;p&gt;People in their middle age â€œare increasingly likely to try and lose weight by dieting, with anti-obesity medications, or surgery,â€� Rudich said. â€œThe findings show that we need to make sure we are not igniting an unwanted inflammatory response in the brain during the active phase of losing weight.â€�&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Studies about weight gain, but not weight loss&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that 64 percent of Israelis are &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/tel-aviv-university-study-argues-third-of-normal-weight-israelis-are-secretly-obese/"&gt;overweight&lt;/a&gt; or obese according to World Health Organization standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Rudich said that he and Zemer found that most basic research using mouse models largely ignored the investigation of what happens to the body after weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;â€œMost of the line of research is about young mice gaining weight,â€� he said. â€œWe wanted to look at processes occurring during weight loss instead of weight gain, and specifically in older individuals.â€�&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3695344" class="wp-caption  alignright"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/assaf_rudich_2-e1763889307777.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-vertical wp-image-3695344" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/assaf_rudich_2-e1763889307777-300x480.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, the researchers monitored the weight gain and loss of young mice, similar to 20-year-old humans, as well as middle-aged mice, comparable to individuals aged approximately 40 years or older. (One mouse year is equivalent to 40 human years.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â€œWe gave them a high-fat diet and they were gaining weight really nicely,â€� said Zemer. â€œThey almost doubled their weight following eight weeks of this diet. We just let them eat as much as they wanted. Following these eight weeks, we reversed it. Half of the high-fat group went back to a controlled diet, and we let them lose weight, kind of naturally.â€�&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists said that both the younger and older mice lost weight quickly. Their bodies became healthier, with blood sugar levels returning to normal in both groups. Since high blood sugar can lead to diabetes, lowering it benefits the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The older mice lost almost 60% of the extra weight they had gained. However, when the scientists looked closely at their brains, they found neuroinflammation of the microglia, the brainâ€™s immune cells. The microglia regulate brain development and neuronal networks.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3695400" class="wp-caption  aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/52525.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3695400" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/52525-640x400.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;From left, the microglia from middle-aged mice. Obesity increases the volume and structural complexity of the cells. During weight loss, instead of reverting to the lean stateâ€™s structure, cells were further inflamed. (Courtesy)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â€œThe middle-aged brain appears to be sensitive to this weight loss, and during the period of losing weight, responds with increased neuroinflammation beyond that already triggered by obesity,â€� Zemer said. â€œAnd this is something that occurs in mid-age but is not apparent in young adult mice.â€�&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;h3&gt;Studying the changes on the molecular and structural levels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tsitrina said that high-advanced microscopy and image analysis with advanced computational analysis enabled the detection of sensitive changes in the microglia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She explained that the study showed the body’s adaptive response to weight loss through two complementary dimensions: on a molecular level, by examining signals inside the cells, and on a structural level, by examining the shape and activity of the brain cells. These findings have â€œpotential health ramifications,â€� she said.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3695393" class="wp-caption  alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/IMG_153103.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3695393" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/IMG_153103-640x400.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;From left: young and middle-aged mice were fed an obesity-inducing diet for eight weeks, and the weight loss group was switched back to the normal diet. The pie charts show that instead of reversing obesity-induced genes, most genes in the hypothalamus aggravate the effect of obesity during active weight loss (red).

The volume of individual microglia increases with obesity and further increases by weight loss in middle-aged mice. (Courtesy)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers understand that people want to â€œrelieve the risks associated with obesity,â€� said Rudich. â€œBut we need to test it closely because sometimes we come up with surprising results that make us think in new directions. So, research not only provides answers, but it also brings up new questions.â€�&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â€œThe study demonstrated that not all weight loss is alike,â€� said Dr. Amir Tirosh of Sheba Medical Centerâ€™s Endocrinology and Diabetes Research Center, who is not connected to the study.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3695363" class="wp-caption  alignright"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1534.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-vertical wp-image-3695363" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1534-300x480.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Dr. Amir Tirosh of the Endocrinology and Diabetes Research Center at Sheba Medical Center. (Courtesy)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a written reply to The Times of Israel, Tirosh said that since the study uses a mouse model and needs to be validated in humans, â€œwe will need more studies to understand the long-term effects of this remaining brain inflammation.â€�&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zemer said that the research team is now embarking on a new study to look at different areas of the hypothalamus and to try to gain an even deeper understanding of what is happening with these cells, and what processes can or cannot be reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â€œWe want to understand what happens when people lose weight and then, six months later, gain back every single pound they lost during this time,â€� Zemer said. â€œDo we get any beneficial effect from this weight loss? Or, is it somehow preferable to be weight-stable? Do we gain health benefits by being lean or less obese, even if it is temporary, for several years only?â€�&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â€œWeight loss requires further investigation,â€� said Rudich. â€œWe might need to take action to try and protect the middle-aged brain when attempting to treat obesity.â€�&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;As the years pass, it can become harder to get a good night's rest. The most common sleep disorder in middle-aged and older adults is chronic insomnia, which for many translates to around three years of relatively sleepless nights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests a popular, gentle exercise may improve sleep as effectively as the top insomnia therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong University exercise physiologist Parco M. Siu and colleagues compared the first-line treatment for this sleep disorder, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), with regular sessions of tai chi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of people around the world practice tai chi, a low-impact martial art that originated in China, often referred to as 'meditation in motion'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-form-of-exercise-improves-sleep-the-most-study-finds"&gt;One Form of Exercise Improves Sleep The Most, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that science has shown &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-form-of-exercise-improves-sleep-the-most-study-finds"&gt;similar styles of exercise&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-ways-to-get-a-better-night-s-sleep-according-to-science"&gt;as well as meditation and mindfulness&lt;/a&gt;) can benefit sleep, researchers suspected tai chi may be a useful companion to existing treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study recruited 200 ethnic-Chinese adults who were above the age of 50 and lived in Hong Kong. All participants had been diagnosed with chronic insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were prescribed a course of 24, one-hour group sessions of either CBT-I or tai chi (the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-form_tai_chi"&gt;24-form Yang style&lt;/a&gt;, to be specific) with 100 people assigned to each group. Sessions of either CBT-I or tai chi were held twice a week, for three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183326" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183326" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/tai-chi-insomnia.jpg" alt="bar graphs show lower remission and response rate in tai chi group than cbt group in month 3, but equivalent remission and response rates for both treatments by month 15" class="size-full wp-image-183326" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183326" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Insomnia remission rate and treatment response rate for CBT-I and tai chi. (Siu et al., &lt;em&gt;BMJ,&lt;/em&gt; 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of these treatments, the CBT-I group reported a greater reduction in their insomnia symptoms than those in the tai chi group, with changes assessed using a common seven-question screening tool called the Insomnia Severity Index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when the researchers assessed participants again 15 months later, the tai chi group had 'caught up', enjoying improvements in sleep quality and duration, quality of life, mental health, and physical activity level that were on par with the CBT-I group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, 31 of the 85 tai chi participants who returned for the 15-month check-in had continued their tai chi practice after the intervention period, albeit at a lower frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, just 13 of the 82 CBT participants who returned for a follow-up assessment reported using the skills and knowledge they had acquired during their CBT sessions in the subsequent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that tai chi's accessibility and ease of integration into people's lifestyles may benefit its long-term effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic insomnia can have serious impacts on the body, placing individuals at a higher risk for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/chronic-insomnia-linked-to-ultra-processed-foods-study-finds"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-find-neural-mechanism-linking-poor-sleep-depression"&gt;mental disorders&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/chronic-insomnia-may-spark-changes-in-the-brain-that-trigger-dementia"&gt;cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important that people seek professional medical help for their chronic insomnia. CBT, unlike tai chi, has been proven to be an effective insomnia treatment with minimal side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But accessing CBT for insomnia can sometimes involve long waiting periods because of a scarcity of trained therapists, and depending on access to healthcare, appointments can be expensive or subsidized under limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183330" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183330" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/tai-chi-642x361.jpg" alt="One Form of Exercise Can Improve Sleep Long Term, Study Finds" class="size-medium wp-image-183330" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/tai-chi-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/tai-chi-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/tai-chi-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/tai-chi.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183330" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Tai chi's accessibility and ease of integration into people's lifestyles may benefit its long-term effectiveness.

Illness is predicted to spread faster, infect more people and put higher-risk groups at greater chance of being seriously ill or hospitalized. Doctors and public health experts are warning people to take precautions, including getting this year’s flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For RNA viruses, such as influenza, survival is equivalent to replication. Every time the virus replicates in a host cell, it presents an opportunity for a mutation to emerge. While viruses are technically not alive, it is their nature to mutate and evolve. Through these mutations, they can become more contagious, evade immunity, and become deadlier. This past summer, as flu season cooled down in the Northern Hemisphere, it intensified in the Southern Hemisphere, giving influenza A (H3N2) another opportunity to &lt;a href="https://substack.com/redirect/485d93a3-5a6b-4697-a61d-a92d662ca722?j=eyJ1Ijoibmt3diJ9.QCd34Vl08F0GMIfuCN7EU1qCRF49hjJPir_c-RIbijo"&gt;mutate&lt;/a&gt; — and it did. According to scientists, seven mutations occurred, positioning the Northern Hemisphere to head into a rough flu season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a small group that emerged since June, and since it emerged, it’s rapidly spreading and predominating in some countries so far in the Northern Hemisphere,” Dr. Wenqing Zhang, head of the World Health Organization’s Global Respiratory Threats Unit, said in a media briefing &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/WHO/videos/866160182749483/"&gt;this month&lt;/a&gt;, about the strain H3N2 subclade K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rajendram Rajnarayanan, of the New York Institute of Technology campus in Jonesboro, Arkansas, told Salon via email that the mutations “reshaped the areas that antibodies recognize,” making previous immunity, including immunity induced by the flu vaccine, less effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Rajnarayanan said, this mutation’s significant antigenic drift, which is when the genes of a virus change, is “a real concern.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="left_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have a narrow window to act — boost stockpiles, issue robust guidance, deploy resources quickly, and reinforce surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you combine the immune escape from this drastic drift with further changes that boost viral fitness as it spreads more (which help the virus replicate better in human airways), you get a season where flu spreads faster, infects more people, and pushes high-risk groups into hospitals sooner, pushing infrastructure and capacity concerns,” Rajnarayanan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signs are already here. In the U.K., Japan, and Canada, there have already been increases in flu cases, leading to an earlier-than-usual flu season. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) data showed that &lt;a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/ukhsa-issues-flu-warning-after-32692632"&gt;flu-associated hospitalizations increased&lt;/a&gt; from the end of September into October, affecting people over the age of 75.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Countries hit early may have been caught off guard and are scrambling to ramp up countermeasures,” Rajnarayanan said. “With early alerts now coming from our international partners, we have a narrow window to act — boost stockpiles, issue robust guidance, deploy resources quickly, and reinforce surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One concern is that this year’s flu vaccine was recommended before the new strain emerged. Fortunately, early studies show that the vaccine still offers some protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent study in the medical journal &lt;a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.46.2500854#html_fulltext"&gt;Eurosurveillance&lt;/a&gt; stated “our early estimates provide reassurance that current NH enhanced vaccines provide protection in children, adolescents and adults in the early period post-vaccination. The high VE [vaccine effectiveness] in children and adolescents strengthens the case for optimising vaccine uptake in this group, where we could also see indirect protection of other age cohorts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In England, the National Health Service issued a “flu jab SOS,” urging those eligible for the free vaccine to get it quickly and protect themselves this winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am concerned about everything related to infectious disease under the Trump administration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But public trust in the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) &lt;a href="https://source.washu.edu/2025/09/trust-in-cdc-on-flu-vaccines-falls-nearly-20-among-st-louisans/"&gt;is declining, and no such similar call to action has been made&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, surveillance of the virus has been lacking. During the record-breaking government shutdown, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/22/health/disease-surveillance-government-shutdown"&gt;stopped updating key dashboards&lt;/a&gt; tracking influenza, RSV and COVID-19 activity. While tracking resumed after the shutdown, some public health experts aren’t confident that a tough season will be well-managed by the public health agency under Health and Human Services Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/robert_f_kennedy_jr"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt;’s leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am concerned about everything related to infectious disease under the Trump administration because the chief of HHS is an anti-vaccine advocate and doesn’t even believe in the germ theory of disease,” Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told Salon. “He has destroyed the CDC.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist and author of the newsletter Your Local Epidemiologist, told Salon, that it’s important to note that states still collect data to send to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Within CDC, there is an important distinction between political operatives and CDC scientists,” Jetelina said. “The scientists are still in control of the data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But streams of data are thinner, Rajnarayanan noted, and more delayed because of the shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the mutations, Adalja said getting vaccinated is still the best way for people to protect themselves against the flu this season because the vaccine contains three strains. While it’s a “mismatch” for the H3N2 strain, it’s still protects the H1N1 or influenza B components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The dominant H3N2 strain has evolved away from the H3N2 included in the vaccine so the vaccine strain is not perfectly matched to it,” Adalja said. “The influenza vaccine remains the best way to protect oneself from the virus, especially against severe disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajnarayanan said while masks are “not popular in the USA right now,” they are still a good option for protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Stay home when sick and seek early testing and antivirals if you’re high-risk and develop symptoms,” he said. “Layering these simple measures will significantly reduce transmission and protect the people most likely to become seriously ill.”&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The winter is often synonymous with cold and flu season. Unfortunately, those germs aren’t the only ones spreading widely around this time of year. So gird your stomachs and stay on the lookout for the dreaded norovirus, because it might soon be running rampant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nrevss/php/dashboard/index.html"&gt;latest surveillance data&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cases of norovirus are likely surging in the U.S. Just last week, about 14% of lab tests came back positive for norovirus, double the rate three months earlier, while several states are now experiencing relatively high case numbers. These early indicators suggest that the U.S. will experience a harsh norovirus winter for the second year in a row.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Stomach flu on the rise&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though norovirus is often associated with &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/2025-has-been-a-nightmare-year-for-getting-violently-ill-on-cruise-ships-2000667251"&gt;cruise ships,&lt;/a&gt; it’s a ubiquitous and highly contagious foodborne germ. And it’s been &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/norovirus-cases-are-surging-right-now-2000544279"&gt;on the rise&lt;/a&gt; as of late.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Between August 2024 and July 2025, for instance, the CDC documented at least 2,675 outbreaks in the U.S., almost double the amount reported in the same period the previous year (1,478). More recently, the pace of outbreaks in the fall &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/php/reporting/norostat-data.html#:~:text=During%20August%201%20%E2%80%93%20November%2013%2C%202025%2C%20there%20were%20153%20norovirus%20outbreaks%20reported%20by%20NoroSTAT%2Dparticipating%20states.%20During%20the%20same%20period%20last%20seasonal%20year%2C%20there%20were%20235%20norovirus%20outbreaks%20reported%20by%20these%20states."&gt;seemed&lt;/a&gt; to settle back down. But norovirus is especially prevalent during the winter, as more people spend time indoors, and the early data isn’t looking good for a reprieve.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The 14% test positivity rate this mid-November is right around the same rate observed during the same time period last year. In December 2024, the country &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/norovirus-cases-rise-us/story?id=117138204"&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; a record-breaking surge of norovirus, with a peak testing rate of nearly 25%. According to Epic Research’s &lt;a href="https://www.epicresearch.org/data-tracker/communicable-diseases"&gt;data tracker&lt;/a&gt;, Wyoming, Nebraska, and Oklahoma are currently experiencing the highest number of reported norovirus cases.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;What to do about noro&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s no guarantee that norovirus this winter will reach or surpass the peak seen last year. But even a relatively mild season will lead to plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/infectious-disease/norovirus/"&gt;gastrointestinal misery&lt;/a&gt;. Annually, norovirus causes about 20 million cases of vomiting and diarrhea in the U.S. And though it’s rarely fatal, the illness still sends roughly 100,000 Americans to the hospital every year.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given all that, it’s always prudent to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/prevention/index.html"&gt;do what you can&lt;/a&gt; to reduce your risk of catching and spreading the stomach flu to others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You should always wash fruits and vegetables and cook your shellfish thoroughly, for instance. You should also clean your kitchen utensils, cutting boards, and surfaces, especially after preparing shellfish. And you should thoroughly wash your hands after handling uncooked food, since norovirus or other foodborne germs could be transmitted by your hands inadvertently touching your mouth later.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;And if you’re feeling queasy, you should avoid direct contact with people if possible and consistently wash your hands with soap and water (hand sanitizer will not work against norovirus).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All that might be easier said than done with Thanksgiving and the holidays coming right up. But as anyone who’s had norovirus can attest, it’s an experience that you should try to avoid as much as possible. Speaking personally, I’m crossing my fingers that scientists &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/from-covid-to-norovirus-modernas-mrna-tech-takes-on-stomach-flu-2000550591"&gt;finally figure out&lt;/a&gt; how to make an effective norovirus vaccine sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

test for cancer, treat it and save lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;However, it is a far more complex issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Screening would rely on a blood test followed by scans of the prostate and a biopsy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But this can miss deadly cancers and detect those that never need treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Many prostate cancers grow so slowly you would have to live to 120-150 years old before they were a threat - so they do not need treating, the National Screening Committee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Their recommendations are based on the balance between lives saved by finding cancers early, and treatment that leaves patients unable to control their bladder or maintain an erection, whose cancer was not going to kill them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The UK National Screening Committee recommends:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;no screening programme for all men as it is "likely to cause more harm than good"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;no screening for black men due to "uncertainties" around the impact due to  a lack of clinical trials in black men&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;no screening based on family history&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;but screening should be offered every two years for men between the ages of 45 and 61 if they have specific genetic mutations -

A special group of engineered mice did not. These mice carried a version of a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/traffic-related-air-pollution-causes-liver-damage/"&gt;liver protein&lt;/a&gt; that changed how their bodies handled linoleic acid, the main fat in soybean oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This may be the first step toward understanding why some people gain weight more easily than others on a diet high in soybean oil,” said study co-author Sonia Deol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The engineered mice stayed lean even though they ate the same amount as the others. Their livers stored less fat. Their blood sugar control stayed steadier. Nothing in their behavior explained the difference. Their &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/oil-and-gas-pollution-is-fueling-a-public-health-crisis/"&gt;biology&lt;/a&gt; did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-soybean-oil-changes-molecules"&gt;Soybean oil changes molecules&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linoleic acid converts into oxylipins inside the body. These small molecules rise sharply when diets contain a lot of soybean oil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular mice showed high levels of specific oxylipins that tracked closely with weight gain. The engineered mice, however, produced far fewer of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier work showed that linoleic acid binds to the liver protein HNF4α. The new research showed something deeper. Different forms of this protein push linoleic acid down different chemical paths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The engineered mice carried the form that slowed the conversion of linoleic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/old-oil-wells-are-getting-a-new-job-storing-carbon/"&gt;acid&lt;/a&gt; into harmful oxylipins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several enzymes in that pathway ran at lower levels. Humans also vary in these enzymes, which may explain why reactions to the same diet differ so widely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-energy-shifts-inside-the-body"&gt;Energy shifts inside the body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolomics revealed another layer. The engineered mice had higher levels of molecules tied to mitochondrial activity. These included ketone bodies and several parts of the TCA cycle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These shifts often point to stronger energy use. Regular mice showed the opposite pattern on soybean oil. Key energy molecules dropped. That drop suggests slower energy turnover, which can push the body toward storing more fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liver lipids also told a clear story. Regular mice built up triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, and cholesteryl esters on the soybean oil &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/healthier-diet-could-boost-memory-delay-dementia/"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt;. The engineered mice carried much less of these storage fats. Their livers stayed lighter, cleaner, and less stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four oxylipins stood out as the strongest predictors of obesity. Regular mice showed steep increases in these molecules. The engineered mice did not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When researchers tried blocking one enzyme in the oxylipin pathway, body weight did not fall. That result narrowed which oxylipins truly drive weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-differences-between-the-diets"&gt;Differences between the diets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soybean oil intake in the United States rose sharply over the past century. It now delivers nearly ten percent of daily &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-fewer-calories-helps-the-aging-brain-rewire-itself/"&gt;calories&lt;/a&gt; on average. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of this intake comes from ultra-processed foods. Despite containing no cholesterol, soybean oil raised cholesterol levels in the mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Soybean oil isn’t inherently evil,” Sladek said. “But the quantities in which we consume it are triggering pathways our bodies didn’t evolve to handle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also compared soybean oil with coconut oil. Regular mice gained more weight on soybean oil. Engineered mice gained the same amount on both oils. This means their resistance applied to soybean oil’s chemical effects, not to fat intake as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation markers did not rise in the liver. Still, the engineered mice carried lower levels of certain cytokines linked with obesity in humans. They also held higher DHA levels, a fatty acid known for its calming effect on tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-soybean-oil-turns-harmful"&gt;Where soybean oil turns harmful&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings point to a simple idea. Linoleic acid itself is not the main problem. The trouble begins after the body converts it into certain oxylipins. Those molecules rise sharply on heavy soybean oil intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They push &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/air-pollution-can-derail-metabolism-and-raise-diabetes-risk/"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt; toward fat storage. When the body makes fewer of them, weight gain slows. Stronger mitochondrial activity adds another layer of protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It took 100 years from the first observed link between chewing tobacco and cancer to get warning labels on cigarettes,” Sladek said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope it won’t take that long for society to recognize the link between excessive soybean oil consumption and negative health effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human studies are not underway yet. Still, the message is clear. What the body makes from a food can matter more than the food itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soybean oil seems simple on the surface, but its chemistry inside the body tells a more complicated story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jlr.org/article/S0022-2275(25)00195-6/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Lipid Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 15:08:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPWDVYbDRYNlpUaFJCQy11dVRYWjRCaVNoRTdEY1hjT1JwTF83RXdUcUtoc1JIU2JVQ3YzakRnMmJaNDhiZnhOMTc4WUtidUIzLXdUakQ0cFlqbC01b2wxWlJxNzc0Q2NCcGNPLU5uWkY5X2JYYURIdmttcTN6cFM4cjBNU0hmSlhN</guid></item><item><title>科学家说，每天喝这种果汁可以帮助您延长寿命- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/scientists-drinking-juice-every-day-133000335.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Study: Drinking This Juice Boosts Longevity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;EMS-FORSTER-PRODUCTIONS - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new small study unveils the potential health benefits of orange juice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Specifically, they look into how the drink could extend your health and your life. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does that mean you should start chugging? Not necessarily. Keep reading for more details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orange juice is often lauded for its vitamin C levels, making it a great &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a69500925/immunity-foods-for-cold-flu-season/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:food to eat come cold and flu season;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;food to eat come cold and flu season&lt;/a&gt;. But the latest research says there may be even more benefits associated with drinking an orange glassful every day. A &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mnfr.70299" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:new small study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;new small study&lt;/a&gt; finds that drinking orange juice every day boosts longevity and cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, researchers found that drinking 100% OJ (without added sugar) daily boosted health and longevity markers in participants by modulating their genes and gene expression, a process that “determines how active certain genes are, essentially ‘turning on‘ or ‘turning off’ specific functions in the body,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionnowcounseling.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Manaker, M.S., R.D.N., L.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lauren Manaker, M.S., R.D.N., L.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and women’s health expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes made in participants’ gene expression after drinking 500 millilitres (about 17 ounces) of no-sugar-added orange juice for 60 days related specifically to the body’s ability to regulate blood pressure, inflammation, and metabolism—all factors that contribute to cardiovascular performance and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the Experts: &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionnowcounseling.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Manaker, M.S., R.D.N., L.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lauren Manaker, M.S., R.D.N., L.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and women’s health expert; and &lt;a href="https://manhattancardiology.com/team/mary-greene-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mary Greene, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mary Greene, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist with Manhattan Cardiology in NYC and LabFinder contributor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study featured 20 healthy adult participants aged 21 to 36 and tracked changes in more than 1,700 genes. Three days before the study began, volunteers restricted their consumption of citrus. Researchers gathered data using blood samples and body measurements, which were collected at the start and end of the study. They analysed genes via blood samples using bioinformatic tools. The findings, combined with those from a &lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/fo/d1fo02664j" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2021 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; on the topic, lead researchers to conclude that drinking 100% orange juice (sans added sugar) contributes to better body composition and cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s one caveat: The effects varied based on participants’ body weight, says Manaker. Those who were noted as overweight saw more benefits in fat metabolism, while those considered leaner experienced stronger anti-inflammatory effects, she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This may suggest that body weight modulates the molecular response to orange juice and supports personalised dietary recommendations,” adds &lt;a href="https://manhattancardiology.com/team/mary-greene-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mary Greene, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; Mary Greene, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist with Manhattan Cardiology in NYC and LabFinder contributor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Health benefits of orange juice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes orange juice a potential health game-changer? First, 100% orange juice is a source of flavonoids (a.k.a. antioxidants), particularly hesperidin, which combats oxidative stress, cell damage, and therefore, disease-causing inflammation, Manaker explains. “These natural plant compounds may influence gene expression, leading to the observed health benefits,” she adds. Vitamin C in orange juice also has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this isn’t the first study to link orange juice to better health. “Results from a systematic review and meta-analysis published in &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10408398.2020.1865263" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggested that drinking at least 500 mL of orange juice daily led to improvements in blood sugar, cholesterol, and inflammation markers,” Manaker notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Should you drink orange juice every day?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study benefits showed after participants drank roughly two 8-ounce glasses of OJ daily. It’s important to stress that these findings are based on drinking 100% fruit juice with no added sugar. Even then, the natural sugar content of orange juice—about 40 to 50 grams per 500 mL, Dr. Greene says—could be a concern for people with certain health issues, especially those with diabetes. “Excessive intake may contribute to caloric excess and high blood sugar in susceptible individuals,” Dr. Greene notes. If you have any pre-existing health conditions, she recommends discussing daily orange juice consumption with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are otherwise healthy, having a glass with breakfast isn’t a bad idea, so long as it’s consumed within a balanced diet that isn’t heavy in sugar. “It’s worth noting that most Americans fall short of the recommended daily servings of fruits and vegetables, which means they’re missing out on essential nutrients,” says Manaker. “Adding an 8-ounce glass of 100% orange juice counts as one serving of fruit and can help fill those nutrient gaps.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 14:44:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxOdnczaUc5ajBfWXEwWFZMM3pwVW9mcTQ1MHZDZjduNnhNbTJ2Rlg0MXhWOXRNQWlWNzJycGRtOHNaR2hCU2NKdWVkdkZ2cEJhU2NlTmtJX2ZxVGxhMWpTTlZUZlhtTWFTUjdPdnNQcVh6dEhjMVUzSUQ5a0t6UkdIRjE3ZThOQQ</guid></item><item><title>医生和护士正在呼唤您需要立即停止的“坏”健康习惯- BuzzFeed</title><link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/lizmrichardson/doctors-bad-health-habits-mistakes-november-2025</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

So many chronic illnesses we encounter are wholly preventable. Also, most issues are further complicated if the patient is already in poor physical shape. &lt;b&gt;Exercise and eating a balanced diet &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise-and-chronic-disease/art-20046049" target="_blank"&gt;can help&lt;/a&gt; stave off many chronic issues as you age.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing that stuck with me was a patient, J.D., who was barely 50. J.D. suffered from hypertension and some diabetes. He was also getting treated for ulcers on his legs. J.D. was sedentary and overweight among his many, many issues. J.D. lived a life of 'just doing whatever.' Compare this to my over-55-year-old Brazilian black belt in my BJJ gym. Of course, he's nowhere near how he was in his prime, but good God, he rips us apart when he decides to spar with us somewhat seriously. From a young age, he basically lived his life like an athlete, and he's reaping the benefits as he ages."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/UnluckyCustard8130/" target="_blank"&gt;u/UnluckyCustard8130&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;As we get older, our brains start to change in ways that make them increasingly &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-could-be-ignited-by-burned-out-brain-cells"&gt;vulnerable to disease&lt;/a&gt; – and a detailed new study of these changes points to a way some of this wear and tear might be prevented or reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Leibniz Institute on Aging – Fritz Lipmann Institute in Germany used &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"&gt;mass spectrometry&lt;/a&gt; to analyze the balance of brain proteins in both young and old mice, finding differences in a process called ubiquitylation as the animals aged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin"&gt;Ubiquitylation&lt;/a&gt; adds chemical tags to proteins, telling the brain which of these busy molecules are past their peak and should be recycled. In older mouse brains, the ubiquitylation tags really start to pile up on certain proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cheap-daily-supplement-appears-to-boost-brain-function-in-older-adults"&gt;Cheap Daily Supplement Appears to Boost Brain Function in Older Adults&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our analyses have shown that aging leads to fundamental changes in how the proteins in the brain are chemically labeled," &lt;a href="https://www.leibniz-fli.de/news-events/details/aging-alters-the-protein-landscape-in-the-brain-diet-can-counteract-this"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; molecular biologist Alessandro Ori.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ubiquitylation process acts like a molecular switch – it determines whether a protein remains active, changes its function, or is degraded."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183078" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183078" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MouseAnalysis.jpg" alt="Mouse analysis chart" class="wp-image-183078 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MouseAnalysis.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MouseAnalysis-600x395.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183078" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers checked changes in multiple brain processes as mice get older.

For some (but not all) of the proteins, this dietary intervention restored the chemical tagging to the state observed in younger animals when the normal diet was resumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the researchers didn't study the underlying mechanisms in detail, the implication is that protein tagging in the brain – hugely important for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cheap-daily-supplement-appears-to-boost-brain-function-in-older-adults"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt; – can be adjusted through diet, even in old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, there are lots of caveats to consider – including that none of this has been tested in living humans yet – but the research takes us several steps forward in understanding some of the shifting processes that happen in the brain in later years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could be important in efforts to improve treatments for conditions where brain protein balance plays a role – &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fat-buildup-in-brain-cells-could-provide-new-target-for-alzheimers-treatment"&gt;including Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-pinpoint-one-key-molecule-behind-exercises-anti-aging-power"&gt;Scientists Pinpoint One Key Molecule Behind Exercise's Anti-Aging Power&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain is an incredibly complex piece of biological machinery, making &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/switching-off-one-crucial-protein-appears-to-reverse-brain-aging-in-mice"&gt;the study of it&lt;/a&gt; (and problems thereof) challenging. Even within this research, the observed changes weren't universal across all of the proteins and protein management processes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our results show that even in old age, diet can still have an important influence on molecular processes in the brain," &lt;a href="https://www.leibniz-fli.de/news-events/details/aging-alters-the-protein-landscape-in-the-brain-diet-can-counteract-this"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Ori.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, diet does not affect all aging processes in the brain equally: some are slowed down, while others hardly change or even increase."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-60542-6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

According to data from the CDC, from 1999 to 2020 there was a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/united-states-cancer-statistics/publications/colorectal-cancer-stat-bite.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;185% increase in colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; among adults aged between 20 and 24, and a 333% increase among teenagers aged between 15 and 19. In 2020 alone, colorectal cancer led to more than &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/colorectal-cancer" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;930,000 deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, the World Health Organization reports. Recognising the symptoms early could mean the difference between life and death. In a video shared on Instagram, Dr Saurabh Sethi, a California-based gastroenterologist trained at Harvard and Stanford, shared five warning signs of colon cancer that one should not ignore. Let’s take a look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is colorectal cancer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cancer that &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/about.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;starts in the colon or the rectum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; is called colorectal cancer, as per the American Cancer Society. When the cancer starts in the colon, it is called colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 Hidden Signs of Colon Cancer You Could Be Ignoring That Might Save Your Life | Dr Deep Goel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age, family history, inherited colon cancer-related mutations (HNPCC, FAP, and Peutz–Jeghers polyposis), a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and environmental and lifestyle factors play a crucial role in increasing the risk of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Warning signs of colon cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More and more young people are getting diagnosed with colon cancer,” Dr Sethi said. Detecting colon cancer early can significantly improve treatment options and outcomes. Here are five symptoms that you should not ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Blood in stool&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rectal bleeding could be a warning sign of colon cancer. If you find any blood in your stool, in the toilet bowl, or on toilet paper after a bowel movement, do not dismiss it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Change in the shape or size of your poop&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, you should never dismiss changes in your bowel movement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sethi noted that a “change in the shape and size of your stool could indicate narrowing of the colon”. So, if you notice any changes in your stool, and if they are persistent, it is time to book an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chronic abdominal pain&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you often feel pain in your belly? It should not be dismissed as ‘just diet’. Dr Sethi warned that chronic abdominal pain is a major symptom of colon cancer. If your ongoing cramping, bloating, or discomfort does not resolve with typical remedies, you should be concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Unintentional weight loss&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losing weight without trying is a red flag for various cancers. If you notice the number on your weighing scale going down without changes to your diet or exercise routine, you must talk to your doctor. This is also a symptom of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fatigue&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you feel tired all the time? If you wake up tired, even after a restful night’s sleep, you should be concerned. This is, unfortunately, one of the crucial signs that may go unnoticed. People often dismiss it as simple tiredness. But if you feel fatigued often, without any reason, it is important to seek medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Iron deficiency anaemia&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This symptom is often silent until detected via routine blood work. Tumours in the colon can bleed slowly and continuously, leading to iron deficiency. “Iron deficiency anaemia can happen even if you don't notice any obvious bleeding,” Dr Sethi explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bottom line&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above-mentioned signs and symptoms may point to colon cancer; however, having them does not always mean so. “Keep in mind these issues can be seen with a lot of other medical conditions, so make sure to check with your doctor,” Dr Sethi said. However, being aware of these symptoms is important because early diagnosis can save lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

And whenever they hear about sweet potatoes, they wonder: Are they actually good for blood sugar?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of their natural sweetness, sweet potatoes may seem like a food that could spike glucose levels. But nutrition research says the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweet potato, a common, humble root vegetable that is rich in fiber, antioxidants, vitamins, and slow-release starch, offers more than just comfort and taste. Research and nutritional reviews reveal that sweet potatoes are a “smart carb” choice: when prepared the right way and eaten in moderation, they can help stabilize blood sugar, support insulin sensitivity and long-term metabolic health, and offer vital vitamins and antioxidants. In fact, rather than being shunned like many starchy foods, sweet potatoes may belong in the “eat more” list — not as a cure, but as a supportive dietary ally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with prediabetes or diabetes, or those simply seeking stable energy and better metabolic health, knowing how to pick, cook, and eat sweet potatoes can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s unpack!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 11:21:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>糖与锯齿：肠道医生，帕尔博士对精制白色晶体之间更健康的选择进行了现实检查-经济时报</title><link>https://m.economictimes.com/magazines/panache/sugar-vs-jaggery-gastro-doctor-dr-pal-gives-a-reality-check-on-healthier-choice-between-refined-white-crystals-and-traditional-indian-sweetener/articleshow/125546725.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-brcount="20" class="artText"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A familiar debate resurfaced this week after &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a ref="dofollow" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" href="/topic/gastroenterologist" target="_blank"&gt;gastroenterologist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dr Pal Manickam shared a detailed comparison of sugar and jaggery on Instagram. While the traditional sweetener often enjoys a reputation for being the healthier pick, the doctor urged viewers to understand what actually happens once these foods enter the bloodstream. His explanation was featured in a video highlighted by an Instagram post, where he broke down myths attached to both ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Pal began by addressing a common belief that brown sugar and jaggery are fundamentally different from white sugar. Referring to his demonstration in the video, he explained that brown sugar loses its dark colour when placed in water because the molasses drains out. He emphasised that the body treats most sweeteners the same way. Whether one consumes white sugar, brown sugar, jaggery or any organic variant, the bloodstream converts them into glucose, causing similar spikes in blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-newpos-mgid="mgid_125546725" id="div-mgid-mid-newpos-125546725"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="E_3" class="etoro"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Palm Jaggery Gets Some Extra Points&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discussion, however, did not end with a blanket comparison. Dr Pal noted that palm jaggery has a slight advantage over refined white sugar. As cited from the video, he highlighted that palm jaggery has a lower &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a ref="dofollow" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" href="/topic/glycemic-index" target="_blank"&gt;glycemic index&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. This means it raises blood sugar more gradually, offering steadier energy levels. He added that palm jaggery is also more eco friendly because palm trees use less land and water than sugarcane. Its micronutrient content provides an additional edge, though he stressed that this benefit should not be overstated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-vdoai="vdoai_125546725" id="div-vdoai-mid-125546725"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Clearing Up Confusion About Impurities&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video also attempted to put rumours to rest regarding jaggery turning lighter in colour when dissolved. Dr Pal clarified that the whitening is simply the result of impurities dissolving and not evidence of adulteration. He added that this process does not wash away minerals and does not make jaggery unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID_INTL_300" data-loc="100" id="div-gpt-ad-858478126-1-125546725" class="country_specAD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="2" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-125546725" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="5" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-125546725" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="3" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-125546725" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Moderation Still Rules&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite acknowledging that jaggery is traditional, flavourful and slightly better than white sugar when consumed in equal amounts, Dr Pal issued a reminder that it remains a form of sugar. People should avoid treating it as a health food. He noted humorously that many avoid white sugar but freely indulge in jaggery, often consuming more than recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Pal Manickam, widely known for simplifying medical science through his signature blend of humour and explanation, is a board certified gastroenterologist and Director of Preventive Gastroenterology at a California based practice. His work often focuses on gut health, plant based diets and time restricted eating. With a strong social media presence, his content aims to inform the public through an approach that merges comedy with evidence based guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional guidance from nutrition experts underscores that both sugar and jaggery originate from sugarcane and offer similar calorie loads, despite jaggery’s reputation as a natural alternative. According to a recent Redcliffe Labs report, jaggery retains small amounts of minerals, but its high glycemic index means it can still raise blood sugar significantly, making moderation essential for everyone, including people with diabetes. Specialists advise that neither sweetener should be viewed as inherently healthier, and limiting overall intake remains the safest approach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;meta content="cms.article3" name="cmsei-article3"&gt;&lt;div class="inSideInd"&gt;&lt;div data-ga-action="Preference Banner InArticle Widget" data-ga-impression="Preference Banner InArticle Widget#Impressions | Preference Banner | Articleshow#url" class="Pbanner"&gt;&lt;div class="Pbannertext"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="ET Logo" src="https://img.etimg.com/photo/123467569.cms"&gt;&lt;p&gt; as a Reliable and Trusted News Source&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Economic Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 11:15:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>在人类基因组中发现新的“突变热点” - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/new-mutation-hotspot-discovered-in-the-human-genome</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Scientists have pinpointed precise regions in the human genome where DNA is most likely to develop a mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At spots where &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_polymerase"&gt;RNA polymerase&lt;/a&gt; 'opens' your DNA to read and copy instructions – known as transcription start sites – your genome is especially vulnerable to damage and the occasional imperfect repair that can lead to permanent changes. Scientists call these locations 'mutation hotspots', and they may be crucial for understanding &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/rare-genetic-disease-appears-to-defend-ashkenazi-jews-against-tb"&gt;genetic disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These sequences are extremely prone to mutations and rank among the most functionally important regions in the entire human genome, together with protein-coding sequences," &lt;a href="https://www.crg.eu/en/news/new-mutation-hotspot-discovered-human-genome"&gt;says geneticist Donate Weghorn&lt;/a&gt; of the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-are-evolving-in-front-of-our-eyes-on-the-tibetan-plateau"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Humans Are Evolving in Front of Our Eyes on The Tibetan Plateau&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic mutation often occurs when damaged DNA is unable to repair itself correctly, resulting in a small but irreversible change to the genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most mutations&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/mutationsanddisorders/neutralmutations/"&gt; are benign&lt;/a&gt; and have no effect on health or development. Rarely, mutations &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/homo-galacticus-how-space-will-shape-the-humans-of-the-future"&gt;can be beneficial&lt;/a&gt;. Advantageous m&lt;span&gt;utations &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/harmful-genetic-mutations-may-be-less-common-than-we-thought-94782"&gt;drive evolution&lt;/a&gt; and life's ability to adapt to changing circumstances.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/older-mens-sperm-carry-more-mutations-and-they-may-turn-harmful"&gt;harmful mutations&lt;/a&gt; can cause real problems – and &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/For-Patients-and-Families/Genetic-Disorders"&gt;even be passed on to offspring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An estimated &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2020.101123"&gt;300 million people around the world&lt;/a&gt; are affected by rare genetic disorders. Understanding the human genome's susceptibility to mutation is vital for developing accurate models for studying these disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genome damage &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2023.11.014"&gt;increases dramatically&lt;/a&gt; during a process called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(biology)"&gt;transcription&lt;/a&gt;, where your DNA is copied into messenger molecules called RNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of your genome as a cookbook, and a gene as a recipe in that cookbook. The RNA polymerase opens the cookbook to copy a recipe onto a post-it note – the RNA – before the book snaps shut. Damage can occur as a result of these actions, up to hundreds of thousands of times per cell per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weghorn and his colleagues wanted to know if this extra wear and tear at the places where transcription begins leads to a heightened rate of imperfect repair – the kind of repair that becomes permanent genetic mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this idea, the researchers dug into enormous human genome datasets, tracking extremely rare mutations (ERVs) across nearly 15,000 genes in more than 220,000 individuals. These are inheritable mutations that have persisted for several generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also examined data from 10 "trio" studies. &lt;a href="https://www.genomicseducation.hee.nhs.uk/blog/the-power-of-three-the-importance-of-trios-in-diagnosing-disease/"&gt;These are studies&lt;/a&gt; in which the genomes of a father, mother, and their shared child are sequenced to identify mutations that the child didn't inherit, called &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/de-novo-mutation"&gt;de novo mutations&lt;/a&gt; (DNMs). In other words, the mutation occurred randomly in the sperm, egg or after they fused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In people with ERVs, the researchers found a very strong and consistent mutation hotspot around transcription start sites. To refer back to the cookbook analogy, it's as though the chef tore the page when opening it, or dropped sauce on the page, and repairing that damage obscured or altered part of the ingredient list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in the DNM studies, that hotspot mysteriously vanished. If it really existed, it should have appeared in new mutations as well as inherited ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer came from 11 previously published studies on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-actually-have-secret-stripes-and-other-strange-markings"&gt;mosaic&lt;/a&gt; mutations, which arise during the first stages of cell division after embryonic fertilization. It happens to every human; we all carry &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559193/"&gt;at least one cell&lt;/a&gt; with a mosaic mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the team looked at the mosaic data, the missing hotspot reappeared – in exactly the same place as the hotspot in the ERV analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early embryonic mutations were clustering at transcription start sites, but because mosaic mutations are patchy, they can look like sequencing noise, and many DNM study pipelines automatically exclude them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a blind spot in these studies," &lt;a href="https://www.crg.eu/en/news/new-mutation-hotspot-discovered-human-genome"&gt;Weghorn says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To get around this, one could look at the co-occurrence patterns of mutations to help detect the presence of mosaic mutations. Or look at the data again and revisit discarded mutations that occur near the transcription starts of genes most strongly affected by the hotspot."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By looking at all three datasets together, the researchers were able to unravel the mechanisms behind the vulnerability in transcription start sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beginning of a gene is a busy, fragile, and complex place where the RNA polymerase frequently pauses to briefly unravel the DNA. This machinery can misfire or leave the DNA exposed just a little too long, leading to damage that scars rather than heals cleanly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a missing piece of the puzzle about where DNA mutations come from – and one that may improve studies of genetic conditions relying on de novo mutation data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-66201-0"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Pre-diabetes represents a physiological turning point where blood glucose is elevated but still responsive to timely lifestyle adjustments. Researchers emphasise that this stage offers a meaningful chance to restore metabolic balance before permanent changes develop. Growing clinical evidence shows that strategic modifications in diet, physical activity, stress regulation and sleep patterns can improve glucose handling and, in many cases, reverse early abnormalities. As interest in practical, science-backed methods increases, understanding how targeted habits influence metabolic recovery has become highly relevant to public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What dieticians advise to manage pre-diabetes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRhPGu2DW17/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Dietician Shweta Panchal, in her Instagram video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, encouraged individuals with pre-diabetes to take action before the condition transitions into type 2 diabetes. She emphasised that the early stage is largely reversible with consistent behavioural changes. Her recommendations are supported by the findings of a major systematic review in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30076075/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Primary Care Diabetes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, which shows that structured lifestyle interventions significantly reduce the risk of converting pre-diabetes into diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She outlined four steps: managing stress and sleep, integrating regular movement into daily life, replacing simple carbohydrates with low GI fibre-rich foods and avoiding late dinners to support better insulin regulation. Together these steps form an accessible and evidence-informed approach to stabilising blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;4 practical steps to manage pre-diabetes effectively:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage stress and optimise sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay physically active with daily movement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Replace simple carbohydrates with low GI fibre-rich foods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid late-night dinners to support better glucose control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Diabetes Management Made Simple: 5 Yoga Asanas That Work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Managing stress and sleep&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress and poor sleep influence glucose stability because cortisol, the primary stress hormone, directly affects how the body manages sugar. When stress remains elevated or sleep becomes fragmented, cortisol levels rise and interfere with insulin’s capacity to transport glucose into cells. This creates fluctuations in blood sugar that are especially harmful for individuals experiencing early metabolic imbalance. Improving sleep duration and quality reduces cortisol surges, while relaxation techniques help the nervous system shift toward a calmer state that promotes steadier glucose uptake. Simple practices such as structured bedtime routines, quiet evening environments and brief mindfulness sessions can support a more regulated hormonal pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Consistent sleep stabilises cortisol and reduces glucose variability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Stress reduction techniques enhance insulin responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Evening routines help balance metabolic rhythms and promote healthier glucose patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Daily movement and physical activity &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular physical activity remains one of the strongest tools for improving glucose regulation. When muscles contract during walking, strength exercises or even short bursts of movement, they draw glucose from the bloodstream, easing the demand placed on insulin. This improves metabolic flexibility and lowers fasting glucose over time. Movement also supports better circulation, enhances muscle strength and reduces inflammation, all of which contribute to better glycaemic outcomes. For individuals with pre-diabetes, incorporating simple activities such as brisk walking, home workouts or climbing stairs creates a metabolic environment that protects against rising glucose levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Contracting muscles increase glucose uptake independently of insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Frequent movement reduces post-meal glucose spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Moderate daily activity enhances long-term metabolic resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Intake of low GI, fibre-rich foods&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food choices influence the body’s glucose response after every meal. Low GI, fibre-rich foods digest more slowly and release glucose into the bloodstream at a gentler pace, preventing sharp rises that strain insulin production. These foods offer sustained energy, support healthier gut function and reduce cravings that often accompany rapid glucose fluctuations. Examples include oats, lentils, beans, dal, vegetables, whole grains, apples and berries. Such foods also support weight management, which is particularly relevant in pre-diabetes where modest weight reduction can significantly improve glycaemic markers. As part of a balanced diet, fibre-rich foods help maintain a stable metabolic environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Slow digestion reduces the body's demand for insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Fibre supports steadier glucose absorption across the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Low GI foods help control appetite and improve satiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Timely meals and avoiding late dinners&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meal timing has gained attention in metabolic research because insulin responsiveness follows daily rhythms. Eating dinner too close to bedtime affects digestion and leads to higher overnight glucose levels. When meals are consumed earlier, the body has adequate time to process nutrients, stabilise post-meal glucose and transition smoothly into the overnight fasting period. Finishing dinner at least two to three hours before sleep supports more efficient insulin function and reduces the chances of morning glucose elevations. This practice becomes more effective when paired with balanced meals and a consistent sleep schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Early dinners improve overnight glucose stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Adequate digestion time supports hormonal balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Consistent meal timing aligns with the body's natural metabolic rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="91"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lifestyle changes as a long-term metabolic tool&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="92"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle intervention is a powerful strategy for restoring metabolic health during pre-diabetes. The effects of these changes extend beyond glucose control, improving blood pressure, cholesterol levels and overall inflammatory status. When habits such as regular movement, mindful eating, structured sleep routines and stress management are maintained, the body gradually becomes more responsive to insulin. These steady improvements can halt the progression of metabolic dysfunction over time. Unlike short-term fixes, lifestyle habits reshape biological processes in a sustainable way, allowing individuals to maintain a healthier metabolic profile as part of daily living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="96"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="97"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When to consult a doctor for pre-diabetes management&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="98"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical consultation becomes necessary when blood sugar levels rise despite consistent lifestyle efforts, or when symptoms such as persistent fatigue, excessive thirst or frequent urination begin to appear. Professionals may recommend laboratory tests, including HbA1c, fasting glucose or glucose tolerance evaluations, to assess progression.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiiav6vk00033b6qbv71rmau@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For decades, measles vaccination has been a global success story. Deaths from measles dropped 88% around the world from 2000 to 2024, according to a new report from the World Health Organization, with an estimated 58 million lives saved in that time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiiceq66000c3b6qhe70oc4f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But now, with vaccine coverage well below the level needed to stop transmission, cases are surging. Fifty-nine countries reported large or disruptive measles outbreaks last year, almost triple the number reported in 2021. A quarter of outbreaks are happening in countries previously declared measles-free, including &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/canada-measles-elimination-status-removed"&gt;Canada and the United States&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiiceq66000d3b6qtjw59sh9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Global measles elimination remains a distant goal,” according to the WHO report released Friday. The progress of the last decades is in peril with the return of outbreaks and decline in resources for immunization and disease surveillance, according to the report — in particular, the US government’s &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/26/politics/trump-global-health-strategy-intl"&gt;reduced support&lt;/a&gt; for global health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidnydq700033b6q1qb3hfou@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Elimination means a virus is no longer circulating and that a country has the capacity to “shut down” infections that come in via visitors and travelers. Canada &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/canada-measles-elimination-status-removed"&gt;recently lost&lt;/a&gt; its elimination status, and WHO is also concerned about the US backsliding and losing its status, said Dr. Kate O’Brien, director of the WHO’s Department of Immunization.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmido5zpe00003b6nlhnp5dlc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that there have been 1,798 confirmed measles cases in the US this year, the highest number of cases since the country reached elimination status in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/05/health/measles-cases-us-record-since-elimination"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidmcc5m00043b6n585xkbi4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Measles remains the world’s most contagious virus,” WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. Even though there’s a highly effective low-cost vaccine, the disease “exploits gaps in immunization coverage.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiie5w5u00233b6qa0l781wh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Globally, more than 30 million children were under-protected against measles in 2024.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader_elevate vossi-subheader_elevate--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmido28sx00063b6qfjpjvy14@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="victories-and-challenges" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Victories and challenges
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidmcc5m00073b6ntu131nbx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been some victories, officials say. Measles deaths have dropped sharply since 2000. Every WHO country and region has committed to eliminating measles and rubella by maintaining at least 95% vaccine coverage, strengthening surveillance systems and making measles elimination goals part of broader health care efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidmcc5m00063b6nbm0x1k0v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recently, Cabo Verde, Seychelles and Mauritius became the first countries in the African region to achieve measles elimination this year. Twenty-one Pacific island countries also eliminated measles and rubella this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidmcc5m00083b6nvbur61u2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have made measurable progress towards measles elimination,” said Diana Chang Blanc, unit head of WHO’s Essential Program on Immunization. But progress toward elimination is “still too slow. Cases and deaths are still unacceptably high.” Every measles death is preventable with a low-cost vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidmcc5m00093b6nh4nfy9q7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Three countries have yet to give the second dose of a measles vaccine as standard practice. That’s important, Chang Blanc said, because the second dose “increases vaccine effectiveness to 95%, providing most individuals with long-lasting immunity.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidpf4z8000g3b6nfk02kggo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In 2024, only 84% of children received the first dose and 76% received the second dose globally. “This means that 30 million children remain underprotected from measles in 2024,” Chang Blanc said. “Children living in fragile, vulnerable conflict-afflicted settings are the most adversely affected.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidmcc5m000b3b6noannrn25@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Progress is not happening at the expected pace, she said, because of lower global immunization rates and backsliding of vaccination since the Covid-19 pandemic. It has been challenging for children who missed recommended vaccines during the pandemic to catch up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiiceoir000a3b6q0sfnjf9t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles acts as a “fire alarm for immunization programs,” O’Brien said. When the disease resurfaces, “it warns that there are gaps in immunization coverage” and health care access inequities. That same gap persist with other vaccine-preventable diseases, too, like whooping cough and polio.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiicu54i00123b6q5mg3wi18@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The alarm has already been sounding on vaccines. The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted immunization program around the world. Measles vaccination levels are still slightly below pre-pandemic levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidmcc5m000c3b6nn1uwbtrd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Misinformation and disinformation are notable factors in slowed vaccination rates, WHO says. But access is still the most significant problem.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidmcc5m000e3b6n39wox3mh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Chang Blanc said that the breakdown or lack of “a strong foundation in the routine immunization system” is the No. 1 reason for high measles case counts and outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidoe0yg00083b6qbxy9abzv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although it sounds simple, Chang Blanc said, those routine systems require trained health workforces, logistic systems, transport, surveillance systems and other resources that many countries do not have.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidmcc5m000f3b6ny3wm012l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The major barrier to reaching 95% measles vaccine coverage is “access to populations that need it most,” Chang Blanc said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidmz6ak001k3b6n156g4ac4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Deep funding cuts aﬀecting the Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network, which include 760 laboratories that help surveil and respond to outbreaks, and country immunization programs are “feared to widen immunity gaps and drive further outbreaks in the coming year,” the report says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidn9u2v00223b6npr362t7w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Securing sustainable domestic financing and new partners is now a critical challenge to advancing eﬀorts toward a world free of measles,” the report says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

More than 20,000 whooping cough cases have been reported so far in 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-789004" class="body-graf"&gt;In 2024, there were an estimated 11 million measles infections worldwide, according to the report, nearly 800,000 more than were recorded in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8ed4bb" class="body-graf"&gt;Last year, 59 countries reported large measles outbreaks. In 2025, the United States joined the list of countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-492538" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elimination status threatened&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a41910" class="body-graf"&gt;The ongoing outbreaks threaten the so-called measles elimination statuses of some countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-efcaa5" class="body-graf"&gt;Elimination means a virus has stopped spreading in a specific country or region. (Only one virus — smallpox — has been eradicated, or wiped out permanently, worldwide.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d4b03d" class="body-graf"&gt;In total, 81 countries had reached elimination status in 2024, according to the WHO. Canada eliminated measles in 1998. Two years later, the United States did the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-40cb1f" class="body-graf"&gt;Elimination status means a country has the capacity to stop an outbreak when measles cases arrive from abroad, O'Brien said. If vaccination rates are high enough, the virus won't have enough unvaccinated people to infect, halting an outbreak in its tracks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-08eca5" class="body-graf"&gt;But vaccination rates in the United States are falling: An &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/data-investigation-childhood-vaccination-rates-are-backsliding-us-rcna228876" target="_blank"&gt;NBC News investigation&lt;/a&gt; revealed that since 2019, 77% of counties and jurisdictions have reported declines in the number of kids getting routine childhood vaccinations like the measles-mumps-rubella shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9de51f" class="body-graf"&gt;The key determining factor for a country to lose its measles elimination status is the ongoing spread of the same strain of the virus for a full year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c4aacd" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/canada-loses-measles-elimination-status-will-us-rcna242630" target="_blank"&gt;Canada met that threshold&lt;/a&gt; this month. The United States could be next if scientists can trace current cases to a Texas outbreak that began in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4fda67" class="body-graf"&gt;Nearly all of the samples analyzed from those early cases were identified as a genotype of measles called D8, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7414a1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;CDC report&lt;/a&gt; published in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ac3b8a" class="body-graf"&gt;The D8 genotype was recently detected in a South Carolina outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-14fe9d" class="body-graf"&gt;Preliminary results from specimens sent from South Carolina to CDC labs "are the same type, D8, that is seen in other settings in the United States," Dr. Linda Bell, state epidemiologist for the South Carolina Department of Public Health, said at a news briefing Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4a478e" class="body-graf"&gt;Additional genetic sequencing is needed to make a definitive link between the Texas outbreak and the one in South Carolina, as well as outbreaks in Utah and Arizona. A South Carolina Department of Public Health spokesman said the agency "expects those results in the next few weeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-31fe1c" class="body-graf"&gt;Bell said that as of Tuesday, 58 cases had been reported in South Carolina, mostly in Spartanburg County in the northwest part of the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dbed05" class="body-graf"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna240592" target="_blank"&gt;outbreak along the border of Arizona and Utah&lt;/a&gt; continues to grow. The &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;Arizona Department of Health Services&lt;/a&gt; reported 153 cases this week, nearly all in Mohave County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8239eb" class="body-graf"&gt;Cases in Utah have reached 102, according to the &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/" target="_blank"&gt;state Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt;. While the bulk of those cases are linked to the cluster at the Utah-Arizona border, case numbers are also rising near Salt Lake City. &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51410730/measles-confirmed-in-8-students-at-wasatch-high-utahs-total-eclipses-100-infections" target="_blank"&gt;NBC affiliate KSL&lt;/a&gt; reported that eight students at a high school in Wasatch County had been diagnosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f54f56" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;As of Wednesday, the CDC had reported 1,798 confirmed measles cases in 42 states in 2025.

Then there’s the legal transformation into an adult at 18: you can live alone, buy alcohol and cigarettes, vote, gamble and get tattoos and piercings without anyone else’s say so. And finally, 21, when nothing much happens at all – unless you’re particularly keen on adopting a child, holding a minibus or pilot’s licence and getting pissed in North America – but which has, nevertheless, been deemed a final step into maturity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet not one of these milestones is particularly reflective of our neurological development. Neuroscience has long shown that our &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/life-style/health-and-families/writing-mental-health-resilience-b2871463.html"&gt;prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;, responsible for impulse control, decision-making, planning and problem-solving, doesn’t fully develop until around the age of 25. But now a &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-65974-8"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; has uncovered a whole new benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on brain scans of nearly 4,000 people, the research mapped evolving neural connections to identify five distinct “epochs”, or eras, for the brain, with changes occurring at four key ages: nine, 32, 66 and 83. Despite our ingrained societal ideas around when someone becomes a grown-up, these latest findings suggest that “adult mode” only kicks into gear &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/news/science/adult-brain-30s-teenagers-crime-mental-health-research-a8828681.html"&gt;in our early thirties&lt;/a&gt;. That’s when the architecture of our brains stabilises and coincides with a “plateau in intelligence and personality”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not at all surprised by this; if anything, I feel vindicated. Though lead researcher Alexa Mousley was quick to point out that they’re “definitely not saying that people in their late twenties are going to be acting like teenagers… It’s really the pattern of change,” the notion that I was an “adult” – responsible or otherwise – in my teens or twenties is risible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-us-premium-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Granted, I was always a late bloomer. At 16, I was still far too busy making up elaborate routines to the &lt;em&gt;Centre Stage &lt;/em&gt;soundtrack with my friends to contemplate coitus. At 18, I may have gone off to university, but I was also shamefully clueless (during a “how to cook pasta” lesson with my mother before leaving home, I really did respond with, “But how can I tell?” when told to wait until the water was boiling). At 21, I dressed up as a dolphin for my birthday party in a grotty nightclub, snogged a stranger, vomited copiously and turned up to my all-year lecture the next day still drunk and singing sea shanties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dfOhoE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/11/26/12/20/iStock-1312770451.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/11/26/12/20/iStock-1312770451.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;crop=3%3A2%2Csmart&amp;amp;trim=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/11/26/12/20/iStock-1312770451.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;crop=3%3A2%2Csmart&amp;amp;trim=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Embrace the ‘hot mess’ era of your twenties" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-110239"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Embrace the ‘hot mess’ era of your twenties&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d like to say that my twenties saw me develop some semblance of sophistication – and indeed, at the tail-end of that decade, I did finally find my way onto a more solid career path and started my first adult-feeling relationship. But, in all honesty, that period was mostly typified by hapless stumbling between dramas. There was the morning I slept through my alarm and turned up 90 minutes late to run a workshop for 500 young people; the day I got to the station and realised I didn’t have enough money to buy a train ticket to work; the time I accidentally &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/life-style/bills-life-admin-tasks-bank-b2605589.html"&gt;built up thousands of pounds in debt&lt;/a&gt; when I moved out of a shared flat and forgot to cancel all the direct debits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won’t even get into the romantic mishaps – we don’t have that kind of time – but suffice to say they were plentiful and ran the gamut from chaotic to embarrassing. “Making good decisions” was as alien a concept as flossing my teeth at that age. It would have been my “hot mess” era, had I actually been hot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1wzq3bw-0 sc-1wzq3bw-2 kqnNdl mbxVq"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-i07cwn-0 dvtoxw"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" id="7b73b88eb27c89ab" viewbox="0 0 80 47"&gt;&lt;path fill="#eb1426" d="M21.18 46.99c9.4 0 17.18-7.73 17.18-17.13 0-9.46-7.72-17.12-17.12-17.12A17.2 17.2 0 0 0 3.99 29.86c0 3.74 1.29 7.47 3.48 10.5l-.13.12A23.6 23.6 0 0 1 1.29 24.4c0-12.75 10.36-23.3 23.1-23.3a24 24 0 0 1 11.53 2.89l.57-.96A26 26 0 0 0 24.33 0 24.3 24.3 0 0 0 0 24.4c0 14.09 9.72 22.59 21.18 22.59m41.47 0c9.4 0 17.18-7.73 17.18-17.13 0-9.46-7.72-17.12-17.12-17.12a17.2 17.2 0 0 0-17.25 17.12c0 3.74 1.29 7.47 3.48 10.5l-.13.12a23.6 23.6 0 0 1-6.05-16.08c0-12.75 10.36-23.3 23.1-23.3a24 24 0 0 1 11.53 2.89l.58-.96A26 26 0 0 0 65.8 0a24.33 24.33 0 0 0-24.33 24.4c0 14.09 9.72 22.59 21.18 22.59"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notion that I was an adult – responsible or otherwise – in my twenties is risible&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I look back, the watershed moments that marked my transition into being a proper grown-up person with her s*** together are undeniable – and nearly every single one happened at around the time identified by the study. At the age of 31, I got a job at this very publication, the first time I really felt like I was intentionally steering my career in the desired direction. At 32, I &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/life-style/how-to-make-friends-new-town-b2310941.html"&gt;identified the coastal town where I wanted to build my life&lt;/a&gt; as an adult. At 33, I &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/life-style/taylor-swift-breakup-thirties-women-joe-alwyn-b2532689.html"&gt;broke up with my long-term partner&lt;/a&gt; because we both realised it wasn’t right – and that, in many ways, we’d always felt like adolescents playing house together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My generation, millennials, have long been accused of refusing to grow the heck up. We’re buying homes, getting married and &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/life-style/babies-birth-rate-decline-fertility-b2605579.html"&gt;having children later&lt;/a&gt;, while continuing to cling on to childhood obsessions with Disney and Harry Potter. But aside from all the socio-economic factors that have led to this perceived arrested development, maybe we didn’t have it so wrong after all. Maybe “kidulthood” isn’t something to be denigrated but a completely natural phase of life, embodying the chaotic whirlwind of our twenties before we wise up, settle down and get comfortable in our own skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not to say we should stay Peter Pans forever. Just that your twenties are for making mistakes, learning from them and figuring out who you want to be. So the next time you miss your train, mess up your finances or go home with someone questionable, just apologise, shake it off – and explain that science made you do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 10:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxPRlBERGdWd3NyVmlfLXJsNFlXRTJLUGhXV1poSVJ1VVBIemE0aUtSc2U4bWpJT2d1UlZ4QUctcFVhSDlUZXhsRlJiYUF1SUVWMWZiMFk1aGhabmVvVkxGQ1JTcHNoUC0wR1ZWMWNmdnBYV3RJMVB5OHhLbFRYalVHY3dQUElmSmxPSlRNcQ</guid></item><item><title>全球健康专家揭示促进消化系统健康的10种方法-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/global-wellness-expert-reveals-10-ways-to-boost-digestive-health/articleshow/125628109.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improving digestion involves not just what goes onto the plate but how, when, and in what state it's eaten. Functional medicine doctors, like Dr. Eric Berg, often discuss such simple daily habits that can turn bloating, gas, heaviness, and sluggish bowels into a lighter, more comfortable gut experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eat in a relaxed state&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digestion starts in the brain. The "fight-or flight" mode shunts blood away from the digestive tract, stomach acid falls, and motility slows. A few deep nasal breaths, a quick prayer-or pause of screens before meals flips on the parasympathetic "rest and digest" system and puts the gut in a better position to process incoming food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;The Importance of a Strong Digestive Fire for Holistic Health in Ayurveda&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chew properly and eat slowly&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chewing mechanically reduces the size of the food and mixes it with saliva that contains digestive enzymes such as amylase. The longer you chew, the more head start the stomach and small intestine have, and thus less work for the rest of the gastrointestinal tract. Eating slowly also allows time for the hormones cholecystokinin and GLP‑1 to signal fullness-which naturally prevents overeating and heaviness following a meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Support stomach acid when needed&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low stomach acid is more common than people often think, especially in older adults or in anyone with chronic stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small amounts of diluted apple cider vinegar, lemon water-or bitter herbs before meals are gentle approaches many practitioners recommend to support stomach acid and enhance protein and mineral absorption. Anyone currently taking an acid‑suppressing medication or experiencing reflux or ulcers should always discuss this with a doctor first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stimulate a healthy flow of bile&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It emulsifies fats and helps to carry toxins out of the body. Traditionally, the use of bitter foods-lemon, dandelion greens, beetroot, arugula, and methi leaves-is to stimulate the production and flow of bile from both the liver and the gallbladder. A plate that regularly includes these bitter vegetables, in addition to healthy fats, can make fatty meals feel lighter and reduce symptoms such as floating stools or greasy residue in the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Use digestive enzymes judiciously&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplementing one's diet with digestive-enzyme supplements has become very popular for symptoms such as fullness, gas, or-undigested food in stool. These supplements provide additional amylase, lipase, protease, or plant enzymes such as bromelain and papain. While they could be helpful with short-term support-for example, when one has to eat heavier meals, or during the recovery phase of any gut issues-they are best used under medical supervision rather than as a permanent crutch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Feed gut microbes with fermented foods&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diversity in the microbiome enhances motility, immunity, and even mood. Conventional fermented foods like curd, yogurt, kefir, kimchi, homemade pickles, sauerkraut, kanji, or idli/dosa batter introduce live bacteria and their beneficial metabolic products, such as short‑chain fatty acids. Gradual introduction in small quantities can help the intestines get used to them, thereby minimizing bloating or discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Include omega‑3 fats and healthy-oils&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good fat does no harm to digestion but helps regulate bile and reduce inflammation along the gut lining. Fatty fish, flaxseed, chia, walnuts, and cold-pressed oils in moderation assist the easy passage of foods through the intestines, nourishing the intestinal cells. To the contrary, seed oils repeatedly heated and trans fatty acids increase inflammation and could exacerbate reflux or irritable bowel symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Space meals and allow an overnight fast&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The migrating motor complex is a housekeeping wave that sweeps any residue of food and bacteria through the small intestine between meals. If one is grazing all day, this system never functions optimally. Leaving four to five hours between meals-and allowing for a 12–14‑hour overnight gap (for example early dinner and slightly later breakfast)-allows time for the MMC to function, reducing small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and post‑meal bloating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Practice light movements after dinner&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Light movement after meals aids circulation and peristalsis, and normalizes blood sugar. A ten‑-to twenty‑minute easy walk after lunch or dinner, a few gentle stretches, or household activity can markedly reduce heaviness and reflux compared with lying down immediately. It is better to save high‑intensity exercise for other times of the day so the gut is not deprived of blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hydrate smartly and manage stress, sugar-and late nights&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adequate water helps prevent constipation by keeping the stool soft, while it also supports the production of saliva and mucus along the digestive tract. Sipping water throughout the day is more effective than taking large gulps with your food, which for some sensitive individuals can dilute stomach acid. Avoid refined sugar, ultraprocessed foods-and late-night heavy dinners to give time for your digestive system to rest and repair. Chronic stress, too little sleep-and rushing around day after day blunts vagal tone and keeps the body stuck in survival mode, showing up as indigestion, cramps-and irregular bowels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 03:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi5wFBVV95cUxNSncwbnFNVjNuMmljcWlXbXNvakFmS0tXNGs1R01WUTdhRUZUSmVCakdmLWJqOE9KRHVWUldzV3dUSlBWLUhadThLZDFRei1lanhNbEFnY1pQNFlhLVNBRWZqQjU0TEN1U242WEN3bDR3bnlnQl9fMUFZTDVCSWhjQWtmSmdZaFBDQlNCSjZKdWc1a2N5X3pfMEVXMVQ1WVcxcVlOV2QwamFxeGZRVjBtX0FEZkhQN1V6TWxwWXRXZ1pVQXdaUmY0V1h6bEp5bjlMd1dURmJOMzYydHZBOEhWbkZvQWxXSnM</guid></item><item><title>根据科学家的说法，这种“奇迹植物”可以帮助治疗阿尔茨海默病-SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/according-to-scientists-this-miracle-plant-could-help-treat-alzheimers-disease/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 02:11:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxQdFFJeEhJbGZuUE45QnJaeUVkWFlxVjZaRVkwRHRLRjZEMmpQNjdPWEF2cEtBQWhZSEFlN0F2eWI3cUJsbTR5dzNNZGRDQktNd0pzR2NISy1DWTlYd0hsUFBmOG0wQ283OWVoYWNvdFJpcHhySXpPdl9CeER3SlcxN3pUUlJMbjVyOFE3U2wtTi1sTUpjaHpyMExiODE0TFpab0NOLXYyNA</guid></item><item><title>这种常见药物似乎可以对抗最致命的脑癌之一- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/this-common-drug-seems-to-fight-one-of-the-deadliest-brain-cancers</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydralazine"&gt;Hydralazine&lt;/a&gt; has been used to treat &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-blood-pressure-guidelines-mean-you-may-now-have-hypertension"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; for many decades, even though it's never been exactly clear how it works. Now a new study answers some key questions about the medication – and adds an intriguing new link to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-7-warning-signs-of-brain-cancer-you-might-easily-miss"&gt;brain cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a closer look at the effects of hydralazine on human and mouse cells, researchers led by a team from the University of Pennsylvania found that it blocks a particular enzyme called 2-aminoethanethiol dioxygenase (ADO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That same enzyme, as it happens, is thought to play a role in aggressive &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/brain-tumours/types/glioblastoma"&gt;glioblastoma brain cancers&lt;/a&gt;. This new understanding of hydralazine could lead the way to new  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="182732" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; treatments, as well as improve the drug's effectiveness for its current targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/serotonin-could-play-an-unexpected-role-in-cancer-scientists-discover"&gt;Serotonin Could Play an Unexpected Role in Cancer, Scientists Discover&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hydralazine is one of the earliest vasodilators ever developed, and it's still a first-line treatment for preeclampsia – a hypertensive disorder that accounts for 5-15 percent of maternal deaths worldwide," &lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/penn-chemistry-serendipitous-find-leads-lifesaving-discoveries"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; physician-scientist Kyosuke Shishikura, from the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It came from a 'pre-target' era of drug discovery, when researchers relied on what they saw in patients first and only later tried to explain the biology behind it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182735" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182735" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CancerDiagram.jpg" alt="Cancer action diagram" class="wp-image-182735 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CancerDiagram.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CancerDiagram-600x415.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182735" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The ADO enzyme catalyzes reactions that produce hypotaurine, which increases cancer growth. (Shishikura et al., &lt;em&gt;Sci. Adv.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers describe ADO as an "alarm bell" that alerts the body to dropping oxygen levels. It triggers a chain reaction, tightening blood vessels by destroying so-called RGS proteins (short for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulator_of_G_protein_signaling"&gt;regulators of G-protein signaling&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-020-00398-5"&gt;Previous studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that glioblastoma tumors are often high in ADO, hijacking it to produce a chemical called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotaurine"&gt;hypotaurine&lt;/a&gt;, which helps the cancer cells spread, survive for longer, and tolerate stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no ADO inhibitors were known prior to this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydralazine effectively mutes ADO, the team found: RGS proteins aren't attacked, blood vessels aren't squeezed, and blood pressure drops. In experiments with human &lt;span&gt;glioblastoma&lt;/span&gt; cells, hydralazine halted &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breast-cancer-spreads-more-aggressively-at-night-startling-new-study-finds"&gt;tumor growth&lt;/a&gt; by blocking ADO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's very early days – t&lt;span&gt;he effects of hydralzine still need to be tested in people with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-deadliest-kind-of-brain-cancer-may-have-a-promising-new-treatment"&gt;glioblastoma&lt;/a&gt; in clinical trials – &lt;/span&gt;but these are promising findings that could unlock a way to control the spread of these &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/nasal-drops-could-help-fight-a-common-and-deadly-brain-cancer"&gt;notoriously hard-to-treat&lt;/a&gt; brain tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newly uncovered mechanism also explains why hydralazine is an effective treatment for preeclampsia, a high blood pressure condition in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pregnancy-ages-a-persons-cells-but-some-may-undergo-an-unexpected-rejuvenation"&gt;pregnant women&lt;/a&gt;. That means the drug can be better engineered and personalized, to reduce side effects and improve results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Understanding how hydralazine works at the molecular level offers a path toward safer, more selective treatments for pregnancy-related hypertension – potentially improving outcomes for patients who are at greatest risk," &lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/penn-chemistry-serendipitous-find-leads-lifesaving-discoveries"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; chemist Megan Matthews, from the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discoveries here mean better drugs for both &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-blood-pressure-guidelines-mean-you-may-now-have-hypertension"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and brain cancer can now be developed, carefully balancing the need to hit particular pathways in cells while minimizing harm to healthy parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And since hydralazine is already widely used, understanding its mechanism of action gives scientists something of a head start if they want to build more treatments based on the compound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further down the line, we might be able to take out one of the key defenses of glioblastoma, adding to the treatments &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-therapy-obliterates-deadly-brain-tumor-in-days"&gt;already in development&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's rare that an old cardiovascular drug ends up teaching us something new about the brain," &lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/penn-chemistry-serendipitous-find-leads-lifesaving-discoveries"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Matthews, "but that's exactly what we're hoping to find more of – unusual links that could spell new solutions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adx7687"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The drug that originally came into the picture mainly as a treatment for type 2 diabetes and heart disease has now been turned into a mere fat-loss jab. What’s more? After the FDA approval, Ozempic has gotten the much-coveted endorsement — from celebrities, influencers, and many more people who have the power and position to influence common people. In fact, as American singer-songwriter-rapper Lizzo pointed out, there is an Ozempic boom happening now that’s erasing plus-size women from the mainstream spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For patients at risk of heart disease or diabetes, Ozempic is a necessary prescription medication — yes. But what if there were gentler, more natural ways to tap into some of that drug’s metabolic magic — not with injections or pills, but with everyday foods and herbs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Heliopolis University (Egypt) have drawn attention to a set of plant-based foods and compounds that appear to influence the same gut-hormone pathways targeted by Ozempic. According to their review, ingredients such as ginger, cinnamon, wheat protein, fermented green tea, and the plant compound berberine may help stimulate the release or expression of a hormone called GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1), which plays a key role in appetite control, digestion speed, and blood-sugar regulation — the very effects for which Ozempic is prized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s spill the beans, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 01:46:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>减肥：研究发现饮食，运动组合可能最有效-今日医学新闻</title><link>https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/diet-exercise-study-best-strategy-reducing-belly-fat-weight-loss</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-7j3c6j"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/exercise-diet-collage-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/exercise-diet-collage-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/exercise-diet-collage-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="eager" src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/exercise-diet-collage-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg" alt="A collage of two photos depicting a healthy diet with bowls of fruits, nuts and seeds, and a woman stretching on a mat with her dog" class="css-1jytyml"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="icon-hl-pinterest css-11oz8gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalnewstoday.com%2Farticles%2Fdiet-exercise-study-best-strategy-reducing-belly-fat-weight-loss&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2Fexercise-diet-collage-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg&amp;amp;description=Fat%20loss%3A%20Study%20finds%20diet%2C%20exercise%20combination%20may%20be%20most%20effective" title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/exercise-diet-collage-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-1nzy6lj css-whkgel"&gt;A new study explores the effects of diet and exercise in preventing weight gain.

Weight gain usually happens slowly, over many years, and we still have limited evidence on how everyday behaviors can help prevent the build-up of fat in different body compartments over the long term. Fat that builds up deep in the abdomen around internal organs, known as visceral fat, is especially harmful. It raises the risk of cardiometabolic diseases and premature death. Finding effective ways to prevent this type of fat gain is therefore very important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Shayan Aryannezhad, MD, MPH, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aryannezhad is the first author of a new study published in the journal &lt;hl-trusted-source source="JAMA" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2841742" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, which found that improving both diet and exercise levels at the same time may be more helpful in preventing weight gain, especially of visceral fat, than focusing on only one of those healthy lifestyle choices. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this study, researchers analyzed the health data of more than 7,000 study participants in the U.K.-based &lt;a href="https://studies.mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk/fenland" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Fenland study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants were at an average age of about 49 at the start of the Fenland study, which followed participants for an average of 7 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participant follow-up included measuring physical activity energy expenditure for at least 72 hours, a &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324553" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;DEXA scan&lt;/a&gt; to assess body fat, and an evaluation of participants’ adherence to the &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324221" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Most long-term studies look at diet and physical activity separately, but people do not live their lives in isolated behaviors,” Aryannezhad said. “Evidence shows that clearer and more consistent links with health outcomes appear when we assess changes in both behaviors at the same time.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This may be because people often make compensatory changes,” he added. “For example, becoming more active may lead someone to eat more, or vice versa. Studying the behaviors together gives a more realistic understanding of how they influence long-term adiposity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the study’s conclusion, researchers found that participants who simultaneously improved their diet and physical activity levels had the highest reduction in body fat, while changing only one of those lifestyle choices was linked to moderate body fat improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists also discovered that after adjusting for &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;body mass index (BMI)&lt;/a&gt;, the correlation of diet and physical activity changes resulted in significant changes to visceral fat levels, showing that visceral fat was specifically responsive to these healthy changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers reported that participants who improved diet and exercise at the same time increased on average about 1.9 kilograms (kg) less total body fat and 150 grams (g) less visceral fat than those who did not make both lifestyle improvements. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a meaningful difference,” Aryannezhad explained. “Gaining 1.9 kg less total body fat represents about 7% of the average body fat in this population.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previous research shows that around 10% increase in body fat is associated with an 11% higher risk of all-cause mortality. The additional 150 g less visceral fat is also important, as visceral fat is the most harmful type. This is approximately 16% of (the) total visceral fat of this population,” he emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Improving both diet quality and physical activity was linked not only with less weight gain, but also with a healthier pattern of body fat distribution,” Aryannezhad continued. “Addressing both behaviors together appears to offer greater benefits than improving either one alone. These health behaviors should be seen as complementary strategies, not competing ones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Mir Ali&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a board certified general surgeon, bariatric surgeon, and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, about this study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ali, who was not involved in the research, commented that he thought this was a good study that showed the benefits of combining exercise and a healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Visceral fat (around the abdomen) has been shown to increase the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and many other conditions,” he explained.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any method that can reduce visceral fat is beneficial to the patient,“ said Ali. “More research into defining the optimal diets and exercises to eliminate and maintain visceral fat loss would be helpful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also spoke with &lt;a href="https://doctors.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/provider/seth-michael-kipnis/1316514" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Seth Kipnis&lt;/a&gt;, MD, FACS, FASMBS, director of bariatric and robotic surgery at Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center in New Jersey, about this research, who said that this study provides evidence for the advice he gives to his patients every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Often, patients come frustrated, having tried to focus on just diet or just exercise without seeing the results they want, especially around their midsection,” Kipnis, who was not involved in the research, explained. “This study demonstrates that the combination of improving diet quality and increasing physical activity is the most effective strategy.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s particularly compelling is the use of advanced imaging like DEXA scans to differentiate between types of fat. I frequently explain to patients that the ‘belly fat’ we are most concerned about isn’t the fat you can pinch (subcutaneous fat), but the deeper visceral fat surrounding their organs. This study’s finding that a combined approach is especially effective at reducing this dangerous visceral fat. It is not just about the number on the scale but the overall body composition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Seth Kipnis, MD, FACS, FASMBS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The finding that individuals who were overweight or inactive at the start of the study saw the greatest benefits is also very encouraging,” Kipnis added. “It provides a hopeful and motivating message for the very patients who often feel the most discouraged.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 01:32:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPX09oRnk1S2ZxZWx6Yy1lVzVqeWs0TkFaeDIwbEVsU0hRMlJodFJDa0ZsN0ZwU1E5TWw1amVQdWRvRWJBeHNIcWhKQl80cnplSXlsUzZfeFVJQm1XQXBDTG9sYl9vaHJPZnhnanpYTUpMUXN6amJQMDNnUTNUNGRwOVpRZndpRHNMZFVxMGxmeDVvTXlUbHVaSjR1cWFfMEI2eXJHdi1ySk5tZw</guid></item><item><title>“零糖并不意味着零伤害！” ：专家揭示了无糖零食对肠道健康的隐患， i -印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/zero-sugar-doesnt-mean-zero-harm-expert-reveals-hidden-dangers-of-sugar-free-snacks-on-gut-health-insulin-and-weight-gain/articleshow/125618386.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent video by Delhi-based Surgical Gastroenterology Specialist Dr Anshuman Kaushal, known on Instagram as theangry_doc, has sparked renewed discussion about the rapidly growing market of zero-sugar and diet-labelled products. In the video, Dr Kaushal warns that foods marketed as sugar-free can mislead consumers into believing they are harmless. In reality, these products may promote overeating, trigger insulin spikes, and harm gut health over time. Accompanying the video, Dr Kaushal shared a detailed report on his Instagram page highlighting the ‘sweet deception’ behind many modern diet foods. He emphasises that zero sugar does not always mean zero risk and encourages careful consideration of what we consume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hidden metabolic impact of &lt;keyword id="31074692" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="sugar-free-snacks" source="keywords"&gt;sugar-free snacks&lt;/keyword&gt; and &lt;keyword id="20516540" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="artificial-sweeteners" source="keywords"&gt;artificial sweeteners&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Kaushal draws attention to the increasing popularity of sugar-free snacks and beverages, noting that packaging claims can be misleading. Many artificial sweeteners and sugar alcohols, he explains, can have a greater metabolic effect than natural sugar. Research cited from the Yale Journal of Biology highlights that the sensation of sweetness, whether from sugar or artificial substitutes, activates the brain’s dopamine reward pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When the anticipated energy does not arrive, insulin spikes occur, and future cravings increase, potentially raising total calorie intake by 20 to 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Five Effective Ways to Detoxify Your Gut Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further evidence comes from a 2023 JAMA study showing that sucralose can elevate insulin levels by up to 30 percent even without the presence of glucose. This process keeps fat storage active despite the absence of calories. Sugar alcohols like maltitol and sorbitol also pose challenges. According to the European Food Safety Authority, maltitol can increase blood sugar levels by up to 52 percent compared with regular sugar, while sorbitol can trigger digestive discomfort even at small doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How zero-sugar products can disrupt gut health and promote overeating&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the artificial sweeteners, Dr Kaushal warns that many zero-sugar biscuits, protein bars, and cakes are packed with stabilisers, emulsifiers, and highly refined carbohydrates such as tapioca starch and rice flour, often combined with added flavourings and preservatives. A 2024 review published in Nature reports that artificial emulsifiers can disrupt the gut lining, increase inflammation, and worsen insulin resistance, contributing to digestive discomfort and metabolic disturbances. These factors may explain why frequent consumers of diet foods often report bloating, gas, and fluctuations in metabolism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;High glycemic index refined starches found in these products can spike blood glucose faster than table sugar, prompting the brain to demand real energy. This compensatory mechanism can lead to overeating. Dr Kaushal notes that individuals who regularly consume zero-sugar sodas often end up consuming 200 to 300 extra calories in their next meal, unintentionally undermining their weight management goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;keyword id="31074693" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="natural-dietary-choices" source="keywords"&gt;Natural dietary choices&lt;/keyword&gt; to support gut and metabolic wellness&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Kaushal recommends a return to minimally processed whole foods for sustainable weight management and metabolic wellness. He advises using natural sweeteners such as stevia in moderation, increasing protein and fibre intake, choosing whole fruits instead of artificially flavoured substitutes, and selecting dark chocolate with over 70 percent cocoa instead of engineered sugar-free desserts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With over 24 years of medical experience, Dr Kaushal serves as a Surgical Gastroenterology Specialist at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, New Delhi. He is renowned for his expertise in bariatric and laparoscopic surgery and regularly educates the public on gut health and metabolic wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Kaushal’s key message is clear: sugar-free does not automatically mean safe. Sweetness without calories can confuse the brain, trigger insulin spikes, harm gut health, and intensify cravings. For individuals seeking weight loss or improved metabolic health through diet-labelled products, real, minimally processed foods may still offer the most effective and sustainable solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Many people feel fine on the outside while small changes inside the body keep building. Dr Saurabh Sethi, a Harvard-trained gastroenterologist, explains that the liver sends out signals before serious damage sets in. These signs may feel easy to brush off, but they tell a story about how the liver is struggling to handle fat, sugar and inflammation. Each clue deserves attention because early action can still protect the organ that works every hour without rest. Take a look&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sudden belly weight that feels “different”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unexpected weight gain around the abdomen appears before any other symptom. It is not the usual bloating from a heavy meal. The fat settles deep under the skin and around the organs, which makes the waist feel firm rather than soft. This shift suggests that the liver is storing more fat than it can process. If ignored, this pattern can gradually progress into more noticeable metabolic changes and further liver strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Fatty liver diet: Best and worst foods for your liver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rising blood sugar despite no diet change&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A healthy liver helps regulate blood sugar. When it becomes fatty, this control weakens. The result is higher sugar readings even when meals stay the same. Some people notice that they feel hungry soon after eating or feel sleepy after simple meals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These small signs point to insulin resistance, a frequent partner of fatty liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Urine that turns darker and stools that lose colour&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark urine and pale stools do not always come from dehydration or a mild stomach bug. When the liver struggles to produce and move bile, colour changes show up in the bathroom. These changes act as early hints that bile flow is getting disrupted, a process that needs medical attention before the condition progresses. Left unchecked, these subtle signs can gradually escalate into more serious symptoms as the underlying issue worsens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A slow fade of energy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatigue from fatty liver feels different from everyday tiredness. It creeps in early in the day, even after a good sleep. Muscles feel heavier, and simple tasks need more effort. Doctors believe the liver’s reduced ability to clear toxins and regulate energy pathways plays a key role in this deep, persistent weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A tight, dull ache in the upper abdomen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mild but recurring discomfort under the right rib cage is a classic clue. It is not sharp like gallstone pain and not cramp-like. Instead, it feels like a tightness or pressure that comes and goes. This suggests that the liver is enlarged or inflamed, which often happens when fat begins to collect inside its cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cholesterol numbers that climb without warning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the liver turns fatty, it struggles to manage fats in the bloodstream. LDL creeps up, HDL drops, and triglycerides climb higher than expected. These quiet biochemical shifts usually appear on routine tests long before any visible symptoms. They are among the most reliable early indicators of liver stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Yellowing of the eyes: a late and urgent sign&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaundice usually means the disease has advanced. The whites of the eyes gain a yellow tint, and the skin may follow. This happens when bilirubin builds up in the blood because the liver cannot process it well. At this stage, quick medical care becomes essential to prevent further complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Easy bruising and unexpected bleeding&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bruises that form from simple bumps and gums that bleed more during brushing suggest that the liver’s ability to produce clotting factors is weakening. These signs rarely occur early. They point toward a more serious stage where the liver’s core functions are affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for educational purposes only.

While sleep is essential for restoring energy, supporting immunity, and maintaining cognitive function, excessive sleep can leave you feeling groggy, unfocused, and unusually tired during the day. Many people who oversleep also experience headaches, low motivation, or the need for frequent naps, showing that the body may not be getting truly restorative rest. Oversleeping can be influenced by lifestyle habits, environmental disruptions, medical conditions, mental health issues, medications, or underlying sleep disorders. Understanding why you’re sleeping too much is the first step toward improving sleep quality, boosting daytime energy, and restoring a healthier sleep routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7 common causes of excessive sleep and daytime tiredness&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Drug and alcohol use &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain substances directly interfere with the brain chemicals responsible for alertness. When someone stops using stimulants like amphetamines or cocaine, the body enters a “rebound” phase. During this phase, the nervous system slows down to recover, creating intense sleepiness and longer sleep durations. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39631226/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in PubMed Central&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that alcohol reduces restorative REM sleep and disrupts sleep architecture, leading to poor-quality rest, morning fatigue, and increased daytime sleepiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Fix Your Sleep Naturally! Sadhguru’s 5-Step Routine for Deep Rest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol also has a complicated effect on sleep. It may help you fall asleep faster, but it reduces deep and REM sleep, the stages that restore energy and cognitive function. As a result, people often wake feeling unrefreshed and may sleep longer to compensate. Chronic alcohol use can disrupt brain signalling and worsen daytime tiredness, leading to unintentional dozing and difficulty staying awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Environmental factors affecting sleep duration&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your environment and daily responsibilities can push your sleep schedule out of balance. For example, people caring for infants, older adults, or sick family members often get fragmented or insufficient sleep, causing their bodies to demand longer rest when possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Irregular routines such as late-night screen use, long work hours, or inconsistent bedtimes can confuse the body’s internal clock. Shift workers are especially affected because their sleep occurs at times when the brain naturally expects light or activity. This mismatch between work demands and biological rhythms can lead to chronic fatigue and oversleeping on off-days as the body tries to recover. Over time, this disruption may also increase stress, weaken immunity, affect mood, and impair cognitive function, making it harder to maintain consistent energy levels and overall health despite attempts to rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Illnesses that cause prolonged sleep&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you are sick, the immune system releases chemicals called cytokines that increase sleepiness to help the body heal. This is why respiratory infections such as flu, colds, or COVID-19 often make you sleep more than usual. However, even long hours of sleep during illness may not feel refreshing because the body is directing energy toward fighting infection. Fever, inflammation, and general weakness raise the need for rest, so extra sleep becomes the body’s natural response to promote recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lack of sleep and sleep debt&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep debt builds up when you consistently get less sleep than your body needs. Whether due to long workdays, late-night studying, travel, or stress, the body eventually reaches a point where it demands extra sleep to restore balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While catching up on sleep can temporarily relieve exhaustion, it can also disrupt your sleep cycle if done frequently. Oversleeping after sleep deprivation may lead to irregular bedtimes, low morning energy, and difficulty falling asleep the next night, creating an ongoing cycle of poor sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Medications that lead to excessive sleep&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many medications contain compounds that slow down brain activity or nervous system responses. Antihistamines, for example, block alertness-related receptors, while some antidepressants and antipsychotics reduce brain stimulation, making you feel more tired. Pain medications, muscle relaxants, tranquillisers, and sleeping pills can also deepen or lengthen sleep beyond normal needs. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37422714/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in Published in PubMed Central&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; concluded that many antidepressant medications alter sleep architecture, some with sedative effects that can prolong sleep or cause excessive daytime drowsiness. If you notice increased sleepiness after starting a new medication, it may indicate that your body is sensitive to its sedative effects, and a doctor can help adjust the dose or suggest alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Physical and mental health conditions linked to oversleeping&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oversleeping can be an early sign of underlying health conditions. Disorders like hypothyroidism slow down metabolism, causing fatigue and the need for more sleep. Diabetes, fibromyalgia, chronic pain, and chronic fatigue syndrome strain the body and reduce energy levels, making longer sleep periods common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health conditions, especially depression, can significantly alter sleep patterns. Depression often leads to hypersomnia, where people sleep long hours but still feel exhausted because emotional stress interferes with restorative sleep. Anxiety can cause mental burnout and tension, which may lead to oversleeping as the body tries to cope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sleep disorders that cause excessive sleep&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain sleep disorders directly affect how long and how well you sleep:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders: These develop when your internal body clock falls out of sync with natural light-dark cycles. As a result, you may sleep at irregular times, struggle to wake up, or feel the need to oversleep to cope with the mismatch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hypersomnolence disorder (hypersomnia): This condition causes persistent daytime sleepiness even after a full night’s sleep. People with hypersomnia often sleep much longer than usual, yet still wake up feeling unrefreshed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Narcolepsy: This neurological disorder leads to sudden and uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep during the day. These “sleep attacks” can happen during routine activities, making daytime functioning difficult.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obstructive sleep apnoea: This condition repeatedly blocks or restricts airflow during sleep, causing brief awakenings and poor sleep quality. The constant disruption leads to extreme fatigue and a tendency to oversleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Restless leg syndrome: This disorder creates uncomfortable, tingling, or creeping sensations in the legs, especially at night. Because it interrupts sleep, the body tries to compensate with longer sleep periods or daytime sleepiness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because these conditions affect sleep structure, the brain does not get the deep, restorative rest it needs, resulting in prolonged sleep times. Oversleeping is more than just sleeping late; it can signal an imbalance in the body, lifestyle, or overall sleep health. By understanding the underlying causes, whether environmental, medical, psychological, or behavioural, you can take steps to improve energy levels and restore healthy sleep patterns. If oversleeping persists or disrupts your daily life, consulting a healthcare professional can help identify and treat the root cause, leading to more balanced and restorative sleep&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
