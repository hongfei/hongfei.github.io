 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers at the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV) found people with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) may be 14 times more likely to develop autism (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In DM1, DNA strands in a gene called DMPK repeat, a process called tandem repeat expansions (TREs), causing the gene to not function properly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For people with DM1, this leads to symptoms like progressive muscle weakness and involuntary movements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The functional errors lead to protein imbalances affecting other genes responsible for brain function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said these gene impairments may cause people with DM1 to develop &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13262707/kids-four-years-autism-diagnosis-giveaway-signs.html"&gt;signs of autism&lt;/a&gt; like repetitive movements, a lack of coordination and sensory issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While autism affects about 7million Americans, only about 140,000 are diagnosed with DM1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study authors, from the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV), said the findings could make it easier to diagnose autism in people with conditions like DM1 and lead to treatments to repair the damaged genes. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ryan Yuen, study author and senior scientist in the Genetics &amp;amp; Genome Biology program at the Hospital for Sick Children in Las Vegas, said: 'Our findings represent a new way to characterize the genetic development of autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By identifying the molecular pathway behind this connection, we can begin to investigate new approaches to ASD diagnosis and the development of precision therapies that release these proteins back into the genome.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This means essential proteins sapped away from DNA could be added back, repairing faulty genes and preventing further errors from appearing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.5776?guestAccessKey=c0957767-f5eb-4d6d-88a4-15c747418b57&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=042125"&gt;another new study&lt;/a&gt; from researchers in China found a non-invasive brain stimulation treatment may improve certain autism signs like trouble sleeping and issues with social interaction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The treatment, called transcranial pulsed current stimulation (tPCS) involves sending electrical impulses through electrodes that are placed on a patient's scalp. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The signals coming through the electrodes are thought to increase brain activity in certain areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found children ages three to 14 who received 20 tPCS sessions over four weeks had 'significant' improvements in sleep, language, sensory issues and socialization.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both studies come as the latest CDC data shows autism is on the rise in the US, affecting one in 31 children. This is a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14619253/america-autism-hotspots-data-rampant-epidemic.html"&gt;staggering increase&lt;/a&gt; from one in 150 in the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While many experts believe the rise is due to better screening and diagnostics, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14625349/autism-expert-likely-causes-america-surge-rfk-jr-toxin-cases.html"&gt;health authorities like Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt; believe environmental factors like pesticides, food additives and ultrasound scans could be to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UNLV study, published in &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01943-0"&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, researchers analyzed RNA in 38 gene sets from people with and without autism. RNA is a key molecule that helps cells build proteins and function properly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found that when the DMPK gene responsible for DM1 repeats, it creates 'toxic RNA' that binds to proteins involved in DNA production during brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That 'toxic RNA' depletes the protein and prevents it from binding the other RNA molecules, causing a protein imbalance and errors in other surrounding genes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Yuen said: 'TREs are like a sponge that absorbs all these important proteins from the genome. Without this protein, other areas of the genome don’t function properly.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers noted both DM1, the muscle-weakening condition, and autism can both be caused by repetitions in the DMPK gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Lukasz Sznajder, a research lead and assistant professor at the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV), said: 'A variation really stood out to me that we see in rare neuromuscular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is how we started connecting the dots. We found a molecular link, or overlap, which we believe is the core of causing autistic symptoms in children with myotonic dystrophy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DM1 leads to muscle weakness around the limbs and, as it progresses, vital organs like the heart and lungs. This leads to abnormal heart rhythms and breathing issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms typically appear in adolescence or young adulthood and start with weakness around the muscles in the face, neck, fingers and ankles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition affects 140,000 Americans and the life expectancy is around 48 to 55 years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study authors said more research is needed connecting DM1 to autism, but the group is planning to look at if these DNA errors are occurring in other genes that have been associated with autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This product, manufactured in the US in a sterile facility, offers a unique answer to stubborn fat. With so many supplements on the market, it can be difficult to tell which ones are effective and why?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img alt="LIPOZEM REVIEWS" name="GNW_RichHtml_External_IMG" src="https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/177c013f-a56a-4fa4-8623-c650bfd0ec3c/lipozem-reviews.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The enhancement of metabolism and the promotion of faster fat burning are two of the ways that it helps with weight loss. It asserts that it provides assistance to the body in converting food into energy in a more effective manner, which makes it an appealing choice for people who attempt to reduce their body fat percentage. They promote what appears to be a simple method of losing weight. A lot of them additionally claim to aid fat loss without the need for extreme measures like diet or exercise. &lt;strong&gt;An effective weight loss supplement with such claims is Lipozem&lt;/strong&gt;. The active ingredient in Lipozem has been the subject of conflicting research findings. Read this review to see whether these promises are true and know more about the strange hack that &lt;strong&gt;Lipozem&lt;/strong&gt; offers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=PrArcnqI1VFmUhPq7xuc1RUx9F8RUG2LXXkC5WuLxa_ksumJVBHRMf46g2RLQCbRAmvVehxlrof1Xj20d2Bm8hGvJtuV3Yfg_4e0BybahIeB9ztlKjztEfqCmG0HolJaFu3RL6La-lkY7Ir83VW7N-LAh3AhylzqFvG1bYSHuOwReMEYpdD7yNJ-nTmOblgH" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIMITED TIME OFFER: GET GENUINE PRODUCT ON ITS OFFICIAL WEBSITE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explain What Lipozem Is?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lipozem is one of the most demanding dietary weight loss supplements in now a day.&lt;/strong&gt; Due to the fact that it contains a combination of chemicals that boost metabolism and reduce hunger, it is compatible with trending health and wellness practices such as the golden weight loss plan.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Individuals whose metabolism may have slowed down as a result of ageing or other circumstances can benefit tremendously from taking this supplement. The Ingredient glucomannan is a type of water-soluble fiber that is found in &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-s0cTP-mkgnnSnu_K3WMlBeuKSRU8P7MiYaiUA2fqBh5qaV88IvtQuSQBYWOZkck13kE8u4zAVUZ6zCJaPR8qbwLROncgVMLzivZbysSsJXXqLOLDxq2wd7fxVoEa6NijPeV3gxrutIL3AIy3L_vlJ659S8MPy9vFM5A7BGVWDKJJFzAGaV5D4xfiHdPmLLvkwzD9S_IYNb-4HKLGV-SOA==" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lipozem&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;which is a weight loss product that may be purchased without a prescription&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, it helps lower cholesterol levels, which contributes to general cardiovascular well-being, which is another way in which it improves heart health. Because of this, it is not only a supplement for weight loss, but it is also a product that promotes general health improvement.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lipozem: Step-by-Step Working!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In an effort to facilitate healthy and efficient weight loss, the formula is intended to preserve the body's ketosis in a state&lt;/strong&gt;. Rather than carbohydrates and calories, this condition allows the body to rely on adipose cells as an energy source. With the goal to simplify this function and provide the body with an adequate amount of energy, &lt;strong&gt;the formula is comprised of natural forms of natural BHB molecules&lt;/strong&gt;. It improves digestion, alleviates inflammation, and resets metabolic function. A new wave of interest in plant-based, science-based solutions has been ignited by this early morning habit. It lowering appetite, enhancing physical performance rates, clearing brain fog, supplying energy, and so lowering inflammation and oxidative stress damage, &lt;strong&gt;the Lipozem formula also helps the users to burn that additional fat&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=wyoQG-ly14Qd5Owbk2YfVIqK2iORivBhBW_1ikFE7yXNIWjkT-241oQZIuDtCs-4YcLc8pyl-V12njj7_V8rd3CiRwx-ElRthF2Jdp_1ZK9nrs9tuFHtOHScghYOM2DLQbEh8XVGTzptKbflGDlCt7HlmYi-1dkvGEfg4rxZyuGnG6NlRu7fCjIUl9DXunkP" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTHING TO LOSE: “LIPOZEM” OFFERS 60-DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power-Packed Ingredients of LIPOZEM!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Taking a look at the natural components that are included in the &lt;strong&gt;Lipozem&lt;/strong&gt; recipe is essential since these components are the ones that are accountable for the effective burning of fat in individuals who use the product. &lt;strong&gt;As a result of Lipozem's ability to enhance digestion, promote fat burning, and speed up metabolism&lt;/strong&gt;, it is able to accomplish a synergistic impact. In the following list, you will discover a potent component!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul type="disc"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium Beta Hydroxybutyrate, &lt;/strong&gt;during the process of the body transitioning into a low-carb state, a molecule known as magnesium BHB is created. &lt;strong&gt;By modulating hormones, this provides the body with the ability to burn fat cells for fuel rather than carbohydrates, which in turn helps to lower appetite&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-xjBRSoD-CfuRh7h12aEqq4WdCrOj2ZEpmrpaHrnA3oRscjYyJU7Z7S5hr26FW-D_2Qk0vPlqGaXSd59E72XxBJ53pqaN7uo0cs5eex5dXyPsUypFLBRarsVtANtZWBbFTAZ8OKJcZf1dfzUXAlSP-rpuDG8U15YY5XQTlQaZxVNF0DyyldJzAI4vida3CAZ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sodium Beta Hydroxybutyrate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;Due to the fact that it helps stabilize blood sugar levels and boosts energy levels, sodium BHB is vital for individuals who suffer energy troughs or who have issues with the management of blood sugar. The glucose level in the blood can also be brought back to normal, which is another advantage. With the support of this addition, the body is able to maintain high levels of energy throughout the course of the day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calcium Beta-Hydroxybutyrate, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=2vD3P6JjnWYgXuoeXXOv_JNKcl8C8sBppH_OGUjnyxqxIXDoqq7fKrq_RJkvz-kXH8Z_0XpfoADPCBF5NGNG2VfJE-gKs6v1zfPrrCK0ksAj-R9EztIMdwM5AbfgrfGo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Calcium BHB"&gt;Calcium BHB&lt;/a&gt; is an element that helps the body transition into a low-carb state more smoothly and decreases the negative impacts of this transition. In addition to promoting improved cognitive capabilities, it helps reduce inflammation and the damage caused by oxidative stress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lipozem Benefits That Make a Difference between Other Products!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A great number of advantages are made available to you as a result of the fact that it is an entirely pure product, with each and every component being pure. These benefits are not restricted to weight loss; in addition to that, it is related with a wide range of other positive health effects, and it is beneficial to your general well-being. Listed below are some of the appealing benefits that are highlighted in the following lines!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul type="disc"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Energized: Lipozem is able to assist people feel more invigorated throughout the day by transforming fat into energy&lt;/strong&gt;. Not only does this increase physical performance, but it also boosts mental clarity and attention, which can make it easier to maintain a healthy lifestyle and keep your motivation up while you are on your path to lose weight from your current weight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep your Body Smart: This supplement is designed to enhance the body's fat-burning mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;. When integrated with a nutritious diet and workouts, it facilitates increased fat oxidation even during periods of rest. &lt;strong&gt;Lipozem&lt;/strong&gt; serves as a significant asset for individuals seeking to enhance their metabolism and properly regulate their weight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control Calories:&lt;/strong&gt; Incorporating &lt;strong&gt;Lipozem&lt;/strong&gt; into your diet makes it a quick and easy way to cut calories without sacrificing flavor. The ingredients regulate your appetite and help you feel full on less.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balance Blood Sugar Level: &lt;/strong&gt;Maintaining normal cholesterol and blood sugar levels is one way that it helps keep the heart healthy. &lt;strong&gt;Cardiovascular health is supported by&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Lipozem&lt;/strong&gt;, which reduces these risk factors and may reduce the chance of diseases including diabetes and heart disease. For these reasons, it is an all-around healthy vitamin that aids in weight reduction and overall wellness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce Depression: &lt;/strong&gt;It improves immunity and lowers cravings, which leads to a more toned physique, which in turn reduces uneasiness and mood changes. As a result, it plays a significant role in reducing depression that is present in the body.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control Craving: &lt;/strong&gt;When it comes to losing weight, one of the most difficult challenges is overcoming cravings and preventing overeating. It is possible for users of &lt;strong&gt;Lipozem&lt;/strong&gt; to feel fuller for longer periods of time and avoid nibbling unnecessarily because the product contains chemicals that are particularly formulated to reduce appetite. It is possible that this will be of great assistance in lowering calorie consumption and helping weight loss goals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thinks to Remember: Important Considerations!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is a possibility that certain people will have difficulty gaining access to &lt;strong&gt;Lipozem&lt;/strong&gt; because it is only available through the official website.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited Stock:&lt;/strong&gt; Because of the great demand for the product, there is a potential that it will be sold out in a short amount of time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age Group:&lt;/strong&gt; Additionally, Keep in mind that there are age restrictions; anybody under the age of 18 cannot take this medication.

Researchers found &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/31/almost-half-of-dementia-cases-could-be-prevented-or-delayed-study-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;about half of cases&lt;/a&gt; could be prevented or delayed by addressing 14 risk factors including hearing impairment, smoking, obesity, excessive alcohol consumption and social isolation – as well as high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now researchers say tackling the last of these could reduce the risk of dementia by 15%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Antihypertensive treatment can prevent dementia in patients with uncontrolled hypertension,” said Prof Jiang He, the co-author of the study, from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. “Given the high prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension worldwide, this effective intervention should be widely adopted and scaled up to reduce the global burden of dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03616-8" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Writing in the journal Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers in China and the US reported how the trial involved 33,995 people aged 40 years and over with uncontrolled high blood pressure, spread across 326 villages in rural China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team randomly selected 163 of these villages, with the 17,407 participants who lived there given intensive blood pressure management from non-physician community healthcare providers, often called “village doctors”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This included free or cheap medications to lower blood pressure, given at tailored doses, health coaching to help them stick to medications and lifestyle modifications – such as weight loss, alcohol reduction and reducing salt intake – and equipment and instructions to monitor blood pressure at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The other 163 villages – encompassing 16,588 participants – received “usual care” – meaning participants’ blood pressure was managed in their normal clinical settings. While lifestyle changes were recommended and some took blood pressure-lowering drugs, this group did not receive free at-home blood pressure monitors or medications, or coaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When the researchers followed up with the participants after four years, they found 668 of those in the intensive blood pressure management group had dementia, compared with 734 in the usual care group – with analyses suggesting the former group had a 15% lower risk of dementia. Further work revealed this group had a 16% lower risk of cognitive impairment without dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While the team noted that the cognitive function of participants was not assessed at the start of the study, they said the similarity of participants in the two groups means this is unlikely to skew the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="a1f21aba-aaa2-48c2-a38a-57dae8d243a2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":11,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Amid all the warnings about a ‘dementia tsunami’, here are the things you should know | Devi Sridhar","elementId":"a1f21aba-aaa2-48c2-a38a-57dae8d243a2","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/08/warnings-dementia-tsunami-research-hope"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;However, Prof Joanna Wardlaw, of the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the work, said the study could not unpick the relative contribution of optimal blood-pressure control and lifestyle changes on the reduction in dementia risk, suggesting the results reflected a combined effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Others said similar research should now be carried out with longer follow-up periods, and added that the approach also needed to be trialled in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Tara Spires-Jones, the director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, said the research “provides further strong evidence supporting the importance of managing blood pressure and other cardiovascular risks to protect the brain during ageing”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But, she added: “It is important to note that treating high blood pressure was not a foolproof guarantee as some people receiving treatment still developed dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 15:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxNSWVkM1VvbXVod1pSdkhLY2pwdXR5THVOUHB4TWVKZVE4S21xTmhLNDU3WHJHRDJNR1EzV2V0QTZuOXBUSWRodlRickZoOXE2bW5xWGRMNTFpSVMtdmw0SkxCOFpxYkhNeXJCU2NvTFJqT294UHdMZjBDSTJDZ1VXUjhCRGdjTTZ6TVlYWDdvWFhVTjVGcDVoSXN5dXpFMEhzYXprUnFZa25qRkZZVzgzWWo5dUp2UQ</guid></item><item><title>50张图片证明人类作为一个物种绝对不意味着持久- BuzzFeed | 50 Pictures That Prove Human Beings As A Species Are Definitely Not Meant To Last - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTE81YmpkSmNVX1pya09LVzdlRXVNNmNyLVdELUdiSkw4TTk2M0VYRUdNZ19LQUE0NVk2Mnk0RHFUQXJZTDdNOTFSRTNtdlh2bnZuWFJlV0NXOVlmRTVkWm5NY2trVjllNFl1OWJYVWpvM1R3Y0dqZ2c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="headerCta__1XoKe"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Newsletters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best of the internet, delivered straight to your inbox!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BuzzFeed</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 14:50:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE81YmpkSmNVX1pya09LVzdlRXVNNmNyLVdELUdiSkw4TTk2M0VYRUdNZ19LQUE0NVk2Mnk0RHFUQXJZTDdNOTFSRTNtdlh2bnZuWFJlV0NXOVlmRTVkWm5NY2trVjllNFl1OWJYVWpvM1R3Y0dqZ2c</guid></item><item><title>神经科学家正在竞相将脑电波转化为语音- Ars Technica | Neuroscientists are racing to turn brain waves into speech - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxPa1dic3NuRU8yQzNzWnBHWlZLWUNPUEdxaU5zUVlhZTIxUnZlUXVYbU1ObDRKcE0yRXNJWGNmTWY3ckQ3Q1U3cnJ3b0lSNHZEdE1tUFdNM2pXVWkyVDBKYzRydHZmMWY3OTYza2pSQXgwMnJhVGdTTVJONHpuS2NuN2NCc1VLSmZodkpqWUQ3NVEtcDVySFFKQV9NWmhFdm8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Many thousands of people a year could benefit from so-called voice prosthesis. Their cognitive functions remain more or less intact, but they have suffered speech loss due to stroke, the neurodegenerative disorder ALS, and other brain conditions. If successful, researchers hope the technique could be extended to help people who have difficulty vocalizing because of conditions such as cerebral palsy or autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential of voice neuroprosthesis is beginning to trigger interest among businesses. Precision Neuroscience claims to be capturing higher resolution brain signals than academic researchers, since the electrodes of its implants are more densely packed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has worked with 31 patients and plans soon to collect data from more, providing a potential pathway to commercialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precision received regulatory clearance on April 17 to leave its sensors implanted for up to 30 days at a time. That would enable its scientists to train their system with what could within a year be the “largest repository of high resolution neural data that exists on planet Earth,” said chief executive Michael Mager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step would be to “miniaturize the components and put them in hermetically sealed packages that are biocompatible so they can be planted in the body forever,” Mager said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk’s Neuralink, the best-known brain-computer interface (BCI) company, has focused on enabling people with paralysis to control computers rather than giving them a synthetic voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important obstacle to the development of brain-to-voice technology is the time patients take to learn how to use the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key unanswered question is how much the response patterns in the motor cortex—the part of the brain that controls voluntary actions, including speech—vary between people. If they remained very similar, machine-learning models trained on previous individuals could be used for new patients, said Nick Ramsey, a BCI researcher at University Medical Centre Utrecht.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class="" data-start="95" data-end="587"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard Morgan, a 93-year-old Irishman, has become a living example of what’s possible when you challenge conventional ideas about aging. Once a modest baker, Morgan now stands as a four-time world rowing champion, a remarkable achievement considering he only picked up the sport at the age of 70. His story not only inspires but also offers valuable insights into healthy aging, as a recent study of his fitness and lifestyle was published in the Journal of Applied Physiology.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-start="95" data-end="587"&gt;&lt;span id="more-5953"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="589" data-end="827"&gt;Morgan’s case has caught the attention of both scientists and fitness enthusiasts. His story provides hard evidence that aging doesn’t have to mean a decline in &lt;strong data-start="750" data-end="760"&gt;health&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong data-start="764" data-end="775"&gt;fitness&lt;/strong&gt;—it’s possible to defy the odds, even later in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="" data-start="829" data-end="855"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="832" data-end="855"&gt;A Body Half His Age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="857" data-end="1265"&gt;What makes Morgan’s fitness truly extraordinary is how his body compares to someone much younger. Researchers have found that his &lt;strong&gt;heart&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong data-start="998" data-end="1013"&gt;muscle mass&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong data-start="1019" data-end="1036"&gt;lung capacity&lt;/strong&gt; align more closely with those of a man in his forties. Weighing in at 76 kilograms, Morgan boasts an impressive 80% muscle mass and only 15% body fat. For someone his age, his cardiovascular and muscular health is extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1267" data-end="1608"&gt;For example, during a &lt;strong data-start="1289" data-end="1316"&gt;2,000-meter rowing test&lt;/strong&gt;, Morgan’s heart rate peaked at an impressive 153 beats per minute—an intensity more typically seen in athletes several decades younger. This remarkable physical condition isn’t just about &lt;strong data-start="1505" data-end="1522"&gt;good genetics&lt;/strong&gt;; it’s the result of a well-rounded &lt;strong data-start="1558" data-end="1578"&gt;exercise routine&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong data-start="1585" data-end="1607"&gt;nutrient-rich diet&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1610" data-end="1912"&gt;As &lt;strong data-start="1613" data-end="1629"&gt;Scott Trappe&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the Human Performance Laboratory at Ball State University, points out, “The body’s ability to adapt to exercise doesn’t fade with age.” This insight underscores Morgan’s exceptional fitness and proves that it’s not just about luck or age but rather a consistent effort.&lt;/p&gt;

The Fitness Secret That Defies Aging!" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ofODzzgGl70?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="" data-start="1914" data-end="1949"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1917" data-end="1949"&gt;It’s Never Too Late to Start&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1951" data-end="2226"&gt;One of the most fascinating aspects of Morgan’s fitness journey is that he didn’t start his athletic pursuits until his seventies. His late start has sparked interest among scientists studying the body’s ability to adapt to intense physical activity, even at an advanced age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="" data-start="2228" data-end="2458"&gt;“The idea that aging equals inevitable decline is a myth,” says &lt;strong data-start="2292" data-end="2310"&gt;Bas Van Hooren&lt;/strong&gt;, a researcher at Maastricht University. “Morgan’s transformation shows that it’s possible to build a strong and resilient body even later in life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="2460" data-end="2805"&gt;This is a powerful reminder that it’s never too late to begin a journey toward better health. &lt;strong data-start="2554" data-end="2575"&gt;Strength training&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong data-start="2580" data-end="2600"&gt;proper nutrition&lt;/strong&gt; are key to slowing down, or even reversing, the muscle mass loss often associated with aging. According to &lt;strong data-start="2708" data-end="2718"&gt;Trappe&lt;/strong&gt;, the human body still retains the ability to respond to exercise, even in older years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="" data-start="2807" data-end="2846"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2810" data-end="2846"&gt;Richard Morgan’s Fitness Routine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="2848" data-end="2993"&gt;So, what does it take for Morgan to maintain a body as fit as someone half his age? His routine is &lt;strong data-start="2947" data-end="2966"&gt;straightforward&lt;/strong&gt; but undoubtedly demanding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="2995" data-end="3182"&gt;
&lt;li class="" data-start="2995" data-end="3042"&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="2997" data-end="3042"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2997" data-end="3042"&gt;40 minutes of rowing several times a week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="" data-start="3043" data-end="3074"&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3045" data-end="3074"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3045" data-end="3074"&gt;Regular strength training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="" data-start="3075" data-end="3182"&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3077" data-end="3182"&gt;A &lt;strong data-start="3079" data-end="3100"&gt;high-protein diet&lt;/strong&gt;, far exceeding the daily recommended intake of 60 grams for someone of his weight&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3184" data-end="3501"&gt;Morgan’s high-protein diet plays a critical role in maintaining and building muscle mass. As &lt;strong data-start="3277" data-end="3295"&gt;Philip Jakeman&lt;/strong&gt;, a professor of &lt;strong data-start="3312" data-end="3329"&gt;healthy aging&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong data-start="3334" data-end="3358"&gt;physical performance&lt;/strong&gt; at the University of Limerick, highlights, “Exercise combined with proper nutrition allows us to build and maintain a strong body at any age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3503" data-end="3887"&gt;For Morgan, each aspect of his routine works in tandem to keep his body functioning at an elite level. &lt;strong data-start="3606" data-end="3616"&gt;Rowing&lt;/strong&gt; helps with cardiovascular health, &lt;strong data-start="3651" data-end="3672"&gt;strength training&lt;/strong&gt; ensures muscle maintenance, and a &lt;strong data-start="3707" data-end="3728"&gt;protein-rich diet&lt;/strong&gt; supports overall vitality. His regimen not only defies aging but sets a powerful example of how lifestyle choices can impact health well into our later years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="" data-start="3889" data-end="3921"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3892" data-end="3921"&gt;A Lesson in Healthy Aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3923" data-end="4323"&gt;Richard Morgan’s story is a clear testament that age need not dictate our &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://glassalmanac.com/the-perfect-water-heater-temperature-to-save-money-without-health-risks/"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. His success reveals that a combination of &lt;strong data-start="4047" data-end="4067"&gt;regular exercise&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong data-start="4069" data-end="4088"&gt;smart nutrition&lt;/strong&gt;, and a willingness to start—even late in life—can lead to remarkable outcomes. By challenging outdated beliefs about aging, Morgan proves that it’s possible to stay physically fit and mentally sharp well into the later stages of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="" data-start="4325" data-end="4643"&gt;As Morgan continues to impress with his feats in the world of rowing, his story encourages us to prioritize health and fitness at any age. His life serves as a powerful reminder: with the right approach, we can all build a &lt;strong data-start="4548" data-end="4563"&gt;strong body&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong data-start="4567" data-end="4583"&gt;healthy mind&lt;/strong&gt;, and a future filled with vitality—no matter when we start.&lt;/p&gt;

chemical levels, said Miriam Diamond, a study co-author and environmental chemist at the University of Toronto. One mattress’s weight was 3% flame retardant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We were really shocked to find what was in the mattresses,” Diamond said. “The kids are getting quite a dose of this stuff.” The study was done in partnership with the Green Science Policy Institute in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Phthalates and flame retardants are classes of chemicals with compounds linked to serious health issues like cancer, reproductive harm, genital malformation, neurological damage, hormonal disruption and early puberty. Exposure to some types of flame retardants is strongly linked to lower IQs in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Phthalates are typically used as plasticizers that help materials bend, and are added to plastic mattress covers, but they were also detected in non-plastic covers, which surprised the authors, Diamond said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some types of phthalates are restricted for use in children’s products in the US because of their high toxicity, and the levels in four mattresses exceeded those. No limits exist for other concerning phthalate compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;UV filters are added to textiles to prevent dyes from deteriorating, and research has increasingly raised concerns about potential health effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Mattresses need to meet flammability standards to prevent fires from spreading, so most companies use flame retardants. However, public health advocates and even some &lt;a href="https://earthjustice.org/feature/firefighters-turn-up-the-heat-on-flame-retardants" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;firefighting organizations&lt;/a&gt; say flame retardants are largely ineffective and do more harm than good because of their toxicity both to people exposed to them in products, and firefighters who encounter them in smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;No federal limits for flame retardant levels in mattresses exist in the US or Canada, but several types of flame retardants that are outright banned in one of the countries, or restricted from use in kids’ products, were found in the mattresses. TCEP, for example, constituted 1% of the weight of one mattress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-13" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1sbse14"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;Detox Your Kitchen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;A seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"detox-your-kitchen","successDescription":"A seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries."}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mattresses made of natural materials such as cotton or latex are less likely to have phthalates, though it’s not a guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Setting mattresses outside to off-gas after purchase can help get rid of some chemicals, but not all, as phthalates and flame retardants could take years to seep away. Diamond said adding a protective barrier like a terry cloth towel that’s good at absorbing chemicals can be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But ultimately, “the onus is on the mattress manufacturers” to stop using toxic chemicals, Diamond said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The mattress manufacturers need to be more vigilant,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 14:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxNdExqQnBiVDZjOHl2ZVRZR2poaGVfRlpvX3kxc2ZVVUhibWwtRnhJdUFpc1NXOUEyeV9MdGI3a1lQTWFLeXVMZXo1RS1HNkZXY3NDejR5QUp5UzBLbDdHZGR6dDEwNUQ1bnpQYXY1ZDBfWEtGYmhPMlQ0YjFDMEtjdWZCckw5WlhCeHV2Tkp2bWF0OU0zQTJj</guid></item><item><title>新报告称，癌症死亡率正在下降，但女性的诊断率正在上升- CNN | Cancer death rates declining, new report says, but diagnosis rates are on the rise for women - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE04bE1wWEkzRThOZGg3LTU2R1lpODJaQ2lKYVU5VFd5S0duWFluNFJId2lsNDFqNlBfT2ZyT0FEUWtodlNZSkZ6Z05LU1RabXN4ZmN1SXlOc05ES0x6Q3lGOGxrOHdVZkJoN0ZmN2RGU2ZoNkdjODBodU5BQdIBckFVX3lxTFB4TzEzYVRqMUR2RjRoUFdHSEFuamFrSXRQejF4ZVVzX2pHRUxJbG8yVzg5T0I2STg2dEhoXzJTOVZBMzdsNGNsLVZ3LTJiVjE0WFVSVFItZjJHeVJ4aXhtd3YyRHlBeUtUWTlVTjBFZDNnZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            A new report on cancer in the US shows a steady decline in overall deaths from 2001 through 2022. The rate of diagnoses among men fell from 2001 through 2013 and then stabilized through 2021 but these incidence rates among women increased slightly every year between 2003 and 2021.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9r3a1q000053b6o8hgiv9gt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those trends were interrupted in 2020, when cancer incidence rates fell significantly, &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/report_to_nation/" target="_blank"&gt;the report&lt;/a&gt; shows, possibly because of disruptions in medical care related to the Covid-19 pandemic. After 2020, they returned to expected levels. “Because fewer cancers were diagnosed in 2020, especially through screening, we may see a larger percentage of cancers diagnosed at a late stage in future years,” the report says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The 2024 Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer was published Monday in the journal Cancer. It’s based on data from cancer registries funded by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US National Institutes of Health’s National Cancer Institute, and it’s released by those institutions, the American Cancer Society and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9r3a1q000073b6obw3h0sn5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Overall, cancer incidence and death rates continue to decline, representing changes in risk factors, increases in screening utilization, and advances in treatment,” the researchers write. “However, sustained disparities by race and ethnicity emphasize the need to fully understand the factors that create these differences so that they can be mitigated.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9r3a1q000083b6ot7p6r2i3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fewer people in the US are using tobacco, helping lower incidence and death rates for smoking-related cancers like lung, bladder and larynx, the report says. And these sustained declines in lung cancer have been a major contributor to the overall improvements in cancer death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9r3a1q000093b6oo38zdqrg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, incidence rates are on the rise for several other cancers, including those linked with excess weight, such as pancreas and kidney cancers; uterine, breast and liver cancers among women; and colon and rectal cancers among adolescents and young adults.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/16/health/young-women-cancer-incidence-report-wellness/index.html"&gt;Previously published research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that cancer diagnoses are shifting from older to younger adults and from men to women. Middle‐age women now have a slightly higher cancer risk than their male counterparts, and young women are nearly twice as likely to be diagnosed with the disease as young men, according to an American Cancer Society report published earlier this year.

            The new report shows that incidence rates among women have risen 0.3% each year. The largest observed increase among women was for stomach cancer, which the researchers say may be largely due to a change in the classification of tumors by the World Health Organization.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Rates of breast cancer diagnoses are also gradually increasing, driven mostly by types of cancer that have been associated with factors like obesity, alcohol use and age when someone gives birth for the first time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9r3a1q0000d3b6oze18y7n2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The data continues to show large racial disparities. For example, Black women have a 40% higher rate of death from breast cancer than White women, and their rate of death from uterine cancer is double that of White women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9r3a1q0000e3b6o14ohnxve@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Differences in access to care and less use of diagnostic procedures and treatment may account for some of the difference, the researchers say. “One additional potential risk factor disproportionately affecting Black women is the use of chemical &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/health/fdas-formaldehyde-hair-products-trump-administration/index.html"&gt;hair relaxers&lt;/a&gt;, which may be associated with an increased risk of uterine cancer among postmenopausal women.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Changing habits such as stopping tobacco use, staying at a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet with fruits and vegetables, avoiding alcohol and protecting skin can all reduce risk of cancer. &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/screening/american-cancer-society-guidelines-for-the-early-detection-of-cancer.html" target="_blank"&gt;Screening&lt;/a&gt; can help find and treat cancers early, before they spread. Screenings are available and recommended for certain people for breast cancer, colon and rectal cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, lung cancer and prostate cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Most of us have experienced a ringing in our ears – perhaps after a concert or a loud party. Usually, it’s temporary. But imagine living with that same noise constantly. That’s the reality for &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/03/19/the-foods-that-can-ease-tinnitus/"&gt;people with tinnitus&lt;/a&gt;. The effects can significantly impact mental health – especially for the 2 per cent who suffer from “tinnitus distress” – a condition that can lead to severe anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first noticed my own symptoms in March 2020. The &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/tinnitus-dominate-every-hour-how-to-manage/"&gt;constant high-pitched buzzing in both ears&lt;/a&gt; felt as if a tiny insect had penetrated my inner eardrums and become trapped. I’d feel an overwhelming urge to claw at my head – so agitated by this sound, imperceptible to others – that simply refused to stop. I knew exactly what it was. After all, as an NHS-trained audiologist with a clinical doctorate in audiology, I’d been treating patients with similar symptoms for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What is tinnitus?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinnitus is described as the perception of a sound in the ear (usually both “bilateral” but sometimes just one, “unilateral tinnitus”) that isn’t presented by an external source, so it can feel uniquely isolating for the sufferer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medically-speaking, when the brain loses access to specific sound inputs, it compensates by increasing neural activity, which is believed to cause the &lt;em&gt;perception&lt;/em&gt; of sound when none exists. This hyperactivity can also interfere with the brain’s natural filtering mechanisms. What’s more, the limbic (emotional) and autonomic (stress) systems come into play, potentially increasing our awareness and perception of tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only five per cent of sufferers have “objective” tinnitus – meaning a doctor can hear the sound with a stethoscope. The majority have “subjective” tinnitus, and there is no test to confirm the disorder – we can only diagnose it based on the symptoms reported. Ten per cent of people – myself included – have &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/ageing/dont-laugh-selective-deafness-is-a-serious-matter/"&gt;normal hearing according to hearing tests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Who is most at risk?/What causes it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of my patients are aged between 20 and &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/ageing/dont-ignore-hearing-loss-in-your-50s-how-to-fix-it/"&gt;50&lt;/a&gt; – though it can affect anyone, regardless of gender or ethnic background. As tinnitus is commonly linked to hearing loss, there can be a genetic element, and it often increases with age. Exposure to loud noise is a common risk – I’ve treated many musicians and construction workers – but head injuries and certain medications can also trigger symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m now in my thirties and have lived with the condition for five years. Mine began when I was &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/stress/signs-of-stress-eye-twitch-ulcer/"&gt;incredibly stressed at work&lt;/a&gt;, and I’d just had Covid – studies have shown that the virus can cause hearing loss and tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are currently no medical or drug treatments for tinnitus, and sadly, there’s a lot of “snake oil” out there. But these are the strategies I’ve found so effective that the condition now barely affects my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Don’t ignore your tinnitus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of people with tinnitus are advised to “just ignore it”. But that’s not helpful. If I say, “don’t think of a pink elephant,” the first thing you do is think of a pink elephant! If you’re constantly trying to avoid thoughts of tinnitus, your brain thinks it’s a threat and pays it more attention. Instead it’s better to lean into it when it’s flaring up - use it as a gauge of your stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m certain stress plays a role for me, when I’m more stressed my perception of the sound intensifies. This has now become a signal for me to know I’m pushing myself too hard and to take a break. I go into the garden and play with my dog and try to tune into the sounds outside instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;It’s more about your brain than your ears&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed there are certain personality types who seem more prone to tinnitus. Those of us who are “type A” who are very highly driven, ambitious and like to be in control can struggle the hardest. Because when we get a medical condition we want to get on top of it as quickly as possible, thinking the harder we work the sooner it will get better. With tinnitus, however, that’s not usually the case. Accepting it’s out of our control can actually help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinnitus is brain related, not a physical affliction - it’s not the ears so much as the signal in the brain that’s being generated and triggering negative feelings. Pushing myself harder wasn’t working, realising I needed to change my outlook and spend an evening watching Netflix (instead of chastising myself for being “lazy”) was more what I needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because no one else can experience the sound you’re hearing there’s a tendency to feel a fraud. I certainly found myself seeking validation from my husband and embarrassed that as an audiologist I couldn’t make my problem go away. Know that tinnitus is uniquely isolating and it’s common for sufferers to avoid socialising, but this can further impact mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Listen to ‘pink’ noise – not ‘white’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might imagine that listening to “&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recommended/tech/best-white-noise-machine/"&gt;white noise&lt;/a&gt;” can mask tinnitus. But I don’t agree. White noise, for example the sound of an electric fan, is more “broadband” – it’s continuous and harsh. Pink noise is a little bit softer, with different frequencies, so it might be the sound of the ocean or running water with modulations which is more relaxing to listen to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Practice good sleep hygiene&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading before bed engages your prefrontal cortex, so as well as being a distraction (especially if you read something escapist, as I tend to) it calms your nervous system. But don’t read in bed, keep bed just for sleeping. Poor sleep can worsen tinnitus, so make sure the room is dark, a comfortable temperature and that your neck is supported (as muscular tension exacerbates tinnitus).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Try this easy mindfulness technique&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing mental overwhelm is key with tinnitus, so don’t dismiss mindfulness as too “woo woo,” I promise you it helps. One technique I use to ground me is the “54321”:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I look for five things that I can see, four things I can hear, three things that I can feel or touch around me, two things that I can smell and one thing that I can taste, like my coffee. This distraction technique forces you into the present moment, telling me that I’m not just hearing my tinnitus, but I’m actively looking for other sounds and sensations to be in the present moment and stop your mind racing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breathing exercises also work well, and there’s an app, Oto, specifically designed for tinnitus which is worth trying. Or simply use one finger to trace the fingers up and down following their shape across your palm, breathing in as you follow them up and out as you follow them down. Even sitting with your feet rooted firmly into the ground is a self soothing device which anchors you, reminding you you’re safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another good technique for calming and distracting is to imagine the same vivid scene time and again. I’m in a cafe with a cup of cappuccino. There’s two ladies sitting on the left of me, having a chat, and they’re laughing. I admire the pink jumper one is wearing. It’s a cosy, happy picture I return to as I feel stress rising. When, in my head, I walk out of the cafe I picture myself walking away from the stress and noise and leaving it behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is the most effective&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;CBT has been found to be one the most effective treatments for tinnitus. This psychological therapy challenges negative thoughts, helps reduce stress and crucially reduces the fear around tinnitus. When I first noticed my own symptoms I often felt so scared I didn’t like to go to bed if my husband wasn’t there. I notice that “fear” is one of the biggest hurdles for my patients too, so CBT teaches us that tinnitus doesn’t mean there is something wrong or that we are unwell. That’s very important in easing agitation. You may not be able to get rid of tinnitus, but CBT can change your relationship with it so much that it no longer dominates your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As told to Susanna Galton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

'They just kind of forget to eat,' DeLauer reveals - seriously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One common habit? Skipping breakfast - unintentionally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These accidental fasts could lead to lower insulin levels and a boost in glucagon, a hormone that may&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14622837/Daily-pill-replace-weight-loss-injections-like-Ozempic-patients-lose-stone-matter-months-trial-data-shows.html"&gt; help burn fat more &lt;/a&gt;efficiently, DeLauer says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DeLauer says another big thing he noticed with people who are slim is that they tend to prefer operating on an empty stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says these people report preferring to train on an empty stomach and they say they can 'think clearer' when they are not full from a meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also, lunch is their biggest meal of the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Celebrity fitness and nutrition expert Thomas DeLauer has shared some of his surprising insights around how people with little body fat keep in shape (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DeLauer talks about his observations in a video as part of his hugely popular YouTube channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He tells viewers: 'I've spent literally years just asking people what they do to stay in shape or what they do to just naturally be thin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Some people say "I've just always been this way" but when you start actually looking at their habits... you start finding there's these common denominators.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One observation that has shocked DeLauer is how many slender people love chocolate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While chocolate is often associated with weight gain due to its high calorie and fat content, the fitness aficionado says in small quantities, it could help stave of cravings. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explains: 'I have noticed that 60 to 70 percent of people that I know that are thin, they consume a fair bit of chocolate, [mainly] dark chocolate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For me, I love dark chocolate and it kills my appetite and it also gives me an energy boost, that I feel really good with.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DeLauer believes that by having small pieces of chocolate occasionally, slim people 'don't feel like they have to indulge in other places' and it satisfies their sweet cravings without going overboard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research shows that dark chocolate has a range of health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists believe a chemical called theobromine, found in cocoa beans and abundant in milk and dark chocolate, is an underappreciated natural elixir with anti-inflammatory properties that could be used to treat Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has also been found to contribute to weight management by enhancing the body's ability to break down fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DeLauer says that most slim people tend to gravitate towards dark chocolate.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While you might think it's down to rigorous dieting and hours in the gym, DeLauer says after observing more than 200 subjects over the years, their fat-busting tactics are much less taxing than that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In terms of their meal choices, DeLauer says slimmer people prefer less fatty foods, and will opt for salads over burgers and leaner cuts of meat such as skinless chicken over a juicy steak.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says in a YouTube video: 'The reality is most [slender] people that I talk to, they don't opt for the fattier cuts, they don't opt for oil.... they tend to just eat that way a little more naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Generally speaking, they are the kinds of people that might do two eggs and some egg whites and they might have it cooked dry instead of in oil.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Strict portion control is another habit people with little body fat follow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has shown that a smaller dinner and larger lunch could be the key to shifting weight, and DeLauer says from his observations, many slim people follow this methodology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Touching on meals and portion control, the content creator says: '[For slim people], lunch seems to be the big meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's like a light breakfast or even skip breakfast, [then a] big lunch and then moving on to dinner, it is just something light and simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'How often have you heard that from your thin friends 'it's okay I had a big lunch'... they're aware of that they don't just feel like three square meals.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He adds that 'there's a huge metabolic benefit to having a big lunch' and 'a lot of the Mediterranean regions do that'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another of DeLauer's observations around slim people, is that they do the reverse of comfort eating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He muses: 'By and large I've noticed that people that are thin, tend to be the people that starve their feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Meaning when they get stressed or anxious or mad, they tend to not eat compared to people that maybe emotionally or stress eat.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He adds that it doesn't mean that slim people never comfort eat when they are stressed but 'these are just common denominators based on about a decade worth of surveying people'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the drinks side of things, DeLauer reveals he has noticed many people with less body fat order water with lemon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says whether this is a 'habit or just for flavor' lemon has a multitude of benefits when it comes to keeping weight off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;DeLauer says something that has shocked him, is how many slim people are big fans of chocolate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One2021 study out of Germany found that a soluble pectin fiber contained in lemons expands in your stomach, which could help you to feel full for longer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shakes are another beverage DeLauer says people with less body fat enjoy, along with an array of supplements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says they often have shakes for breakfast and these people are more aware of the vitamins and minerals needed by the body in very small amounts.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When it comes to exercise, DeLauer says many&lt;span&gt; fit people he meets tend to be physically active without trying to be. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;He reveals one consistent character trait is that they are constantly restless, fidgety and highly strung. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explains: 'They tend to be the fidgety people, the people that move a lot... sometimes a little edgy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's just kind of what I've noticed with them... they're always up around the house, always busy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, DeLauer says slim people will tend to be more outdoorsy than the average person, and they enjoy spending more time outside keeping active or they will ditch driving to walk to a location instead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because they are naturally more active, DeLauer claims this population of slim people actually spend less time in the gym as a result. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On this final point he says: 'Finally, I notice a lot of slim people are actually the ones that don't spend a ton of time in the gym.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They do quick workouts... they're usually in and out in less than half an hour.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 13:31:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQUUZGZjdlREo2bDF5VXRZWmlHd2tKRG9JeW95d05sUFJ6RzRhNkttaG1XYktDdm5ObVdLVU42MnNjVWVXd2hoVGNGX1QwcXM3My1kZElSTGI4bFpscDc5bmIzbHpIem1iWjB3cGF2WmRVUG04b1JoQmt3RHZKRG1pR3J4ZzRPTzBuYXRVX3JQa0k2NGdIX3BabFEyZmPSAaIBQVVfeXFMT244MXI2U0RJSTF6VE15SlNCUE1hSXZtTmRDRURCVTR5a2RfWWlXdGpLVDVXQzZrY2RfOUFwdmgzNnFiWF9GMzRRRGt1ZEZaQ202b3ZQbjdKV0RrOHlkUjFsd2JaN0g4QWRHY0xtWEdNV1lMMTNFSzBhQlM3ekE4bFVWZ2FkYlhrZkZ5VHZrbW9ROWw5bDdfTzNFNHFHeDdkSUZR</guid></item><item><title>在美国梅毒病例急剧上升的情况下，特朗普政府牵制了关键的性传播感染实验室--《卫报》 | Trump administration axes key STI lab amid dramatic rise in US syphilis cases - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxPODl4VHZHZWJ6VDl1Qm5PU05MTUVlVWN4eTRUQUFMR3ZRdzVmdk8yeUdCQmRTV2lWOVdlNUZVd1BjT2tTMF9wekVLUHhsVlBCM2NnNDJmd1NYVTc0QXFFcmVia05mSVUwVVB0UEptOVZaYlotMXN1M1hRWWlZT1hySzln?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;’s cuts to a sexually transmitted infection lab at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) comes as some states, such as Wisconsin, announce enormous increases in syphilis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Syphilis mitigation is just the latest example of work in sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that will be affected by the lab’s closure, as the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;

The trend mirrors a nationwide increase that officials at the CDC described only two years ago as a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/08/epidemic-congenital-syphilis-std-cdc" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;“heartbreaking”&lt;/a&gt; epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Congenital syphilis is also on the rise. The secondary infection occurs when a fetus is infected with syphilis in the womb. The condition is both highly preventable and devastating. Experts consider even one case a sign of failing health infrastructure, because it is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/oct/17/congenital-syphilis-crisis-us-biden-administration" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;easily treated&lt;/a&gt; with a single-dose antibiotic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We have a raging congenital syphilis epidemic in this country,” said David C Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors. “CDC’s STI lab provides an important backup to confirm results and to tackle difficult diagnosis. We know this is going to negatively impact on our ability to prevent babies being born with syphilis and to prevent stillborns from syphilis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are among the most common diseases in the world – and the most marginalized. Years of flagging public health funding already meant that the US had some of the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK573159/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;highest STI rates&lt;/a&gt; in the developed world in four diseases tracked by public health authorities: chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV and syphilis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The most recent data shows gonorrhea slightly decreased and chlamydia remained stable, according to a report from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti-statistics/annual/summary.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC from 2023&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/statistics" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;New HIV infections&lt;/a&gt; decreased 12% between 2018 and 2022, because of new government supports, some put into place during Trump’s first term. Trump pledged to eliminate HIV in the US in his &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/03/trumps-state-of-the-union-2019-hiv-1140379" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt; State of the Union address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In the short term, we’re going to see a rebound in a lot of this because public health departments are already suffering under the clawback, and people are having to let go of staff and programs that support [pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV],” said Gonsalves. “All this other stuff is collapsing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Experts have pointed specifically to the highly specialized lab at the CDC, formally called the STD Laboratory Reference and Research Branch, as one of the most shocking cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The lab worked on syphilis and multidrug-resistant gonorrhea, sometimes called “super gonorrhea”. It had the “highest degree of viral hepatitis expertise of any public health laboratory in the world”, according to a letter from the Association of Public Health Laboratories, and the nation’s only capacity to use a PCR test for syphilis, which primarily still relies on mid-20th-century serology testing. The work was not replicated anywhere else in federal or state government, or in private universities or labs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;All 28 employees were laid off by the Trump administration on 1 April, alongside a total of roughly 10,000 colleagues in cuts imposed by the health secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Together with cuts by the billionaire Elon Musk’s unofficial “department of government efficiency”, the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has lost nearly a quarter of its 82,000-person workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This is very concerning to our ability to maintain a functioning public health system and a world-class system that protects the American people,” said Harvey. “We don’t know what’s going to happen, and we’re very worried about this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Updating syphilis testing was an especially important project for the lab. Although syphilis is easy to treat, it can be difficult to diagnose, even spawning its own medical aphorism: “He who knows syphilis knows medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Symptoms of the highly invasive bacterium can be mild or go unnoticed for years, causing feared outcomes such as dementia-like symptoms or blindness. Congenital syphilis is a special horror: up to 40% of infants who contract the disease in utero will be stillborn or die. Those that survive can suffer lifelong disabilities including seizures, cataracts and deafness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In comments made to the Guardian just before Trump was elected, Dr Jeanne Marrazzo, the director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said she was looking forward to developing new diagnostics for syphilis and researching vaccines for gonorrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We’ve made commitments to things we can’t back down on – and STIs are a great example,” Marrazzo said. “One of the most frustrating aspects of syphilis in the field is making a diagnosis of active syphilis and then monitoring the response to therapy … So we desperately need new diagnostics.” As part of Kennedy’s cuts, Marrazzo was placed on &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-01/fauci-s-successor-put-on-leave-as-rfk-jr-reshapes-agencies?sref=fqqmZ8gi" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;administrative leave&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Similarly placed on leave was Jonathan Mermin, former director of the National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention (NCHHSTP). In 2023, Mermin described congenital syphilis as “an unacceptable American crisis”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In addition to work on syphilis tests, the CDC lab was charged with investigating cases of antimicrobial-resistant gonorrhea. Gonorrhea can only be reliably treated with one antibiotic: ceftriaxone. While resistant strains of the infection are rare, they are rising globally – a fact that is only known because the CDC lab was one of three globally that worked alongside the World Health Organization (WHO) to monitor the disease. Trump pledged to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/18/world-health-organization-trump" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;withdraw from the WHO&lt;/a&gt; as one of his first acts as president. It is not clear what will happen to the 50,000 samples of gonorrhea isolates the lab held in freezers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“They’re irreplaceable,” a former CDC employee, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisal, told &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/05/cdc-sexually-transmitted-diseases-laboratory-closed-by-trump-administration/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Stat News&lt;/a&gt;. “Are they just going to autoclave the whole thing and destroy it?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cuts imposed by Doge and Kennedy have also eviscerated expertise and funding for STI research and testing beyond the CDC. The administration’s clawback of more than $11bn ended grants to study STI testing and prevention among trans women in Florida; efforts to improve the health of mothers and babies in the Mississippi Delta region (an area especially hard-hit by congenital syphilis); and a grant to study the best way to tackle the HIV-syphilis “syndemic” in Chicago.

Are you missing some of the chores on your to-do list? Well, it's time to look at your plate. Yes, that’s right. Your diet has a lot to do with cognition. A new study has found that the absence or decrease of certain vitamins in your diet may impair memory and accelerate cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022316625000306?via%3Dihub" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;The Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that low vitamin K intake impairs cognition, neurogenesis, and elevates neuroinflammation in mice. The study highlights the importance of vitamin K for better brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the link between vitamin K and cognitive function, the researchers examined middle-aged male and female mice fed a low vitamin K diet or another group with a regular diet for six months. The results were surprising. They found that the mice on the low vitamin K diet exhibited poorer cognitive performance and reduced vitamin K levels in their brains compared to the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is also research that indicates vitamin K contributes to brain function and that brain function declines during the aging process,” Tong Zheng, lead author of the study and a research scientist at the HNRCA, said in a news release. “Vitamin K seems to have a protective effect. Our research is trying to understand the underlying mechanism for that effect so that we might one day be able to target those mechanisms specifically.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;7 Daily habits to follow every night for a sharper brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study revealed that the mice on the low vitamin K diet had less interest in exploring novel objects, a hint of impaired recognition memory. The researchers also looked at the physiological differences. Mice on the low vitamin K diet had lower levels of Menaquinone-4 (MK4), which is the primary form of vitamin K in the brain. They also had a lower amount of vitamin K in their livers and kidneys. Male mice on the low vitamin K diet had a decreased survival rate and lower weight gain compared to female mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists found changes in the hippocampus of vitamin K-deficient mice, which pointed to cognitive decline. “We found a higher number of activated microglia, which are the major immune cells in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/relationships/work/trick-your-brain-to-become-successful-with-these-7-simple-psychological-laws/articleshow/120430237.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. While microglia play a vital role in maintaining brain health, their overactivation can lead to chronic inflammation, which is increasingly recognized as a key factor in age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases,” Zheng said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers caution that the study does not mean people should go after vitamin K supplements; instead, try adding vegetables to their diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

            When Dr. Christina Johns, a pediatric emergency medicine physician, thinks about her time working at Children’s National Hospital in Washington, one case always comes rushing back:
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lt2q6000003b6oqeusk9gq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two-year-old. Gunshot wound. Chest. ETA five minutes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h00033b5v8yw15j3m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The child was rushed to the emergency department after being accidentally shot by an older sibling who was playing with a gun that was left unlocked in the house.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h00043b5vs3hsmskl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’ll never forget the … child on the stretcher and the blood-curdling screams of the parent outside the room, lying on the floor, distraught,” Johns said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h00053b5v6bk6xw1e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Every 30 minutes, an emergency department treats another firearm injury, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-02874" target="_blank"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; from researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that looked at 10 jurisdictions, including the District of Columbia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9m1rr5700013b6ow14je84m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But cuts from the US Department of Health and Human Services and proposed changes to the federal budget could threaten research that reveals these kinds of firearm injury patterns. Experts say it would be nearly impossible to replicate the scale and scope of the timely firearm research the federal government is able to conduct.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h00063b5vzcb37c32@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The recent study, which was published last week in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, says that the firearm injury visits are not evenly distributed. There were more firearm injury presentations at night, on the weekends and on some holidays, like Independence Day and New Year’s Eve.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h00073b5vlvmhd9fj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say the results are not surprising but that the findings from this analysis — which the authors say is the largest of its kind to use timely data in urban and rural areas — can inform staffing to provide better care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h00083b5vdv85n6ur@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Knowing when firearm injury emergency department visits are higher can help inform decisions about physician staffing, resource allocation, and trauma preparedness to reduce delays in care and use resources most effectively,” the CDC said in an email to CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h00093b5vr5xgc67t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Johns says the young child she treated survived because there was well-prepared staff at the hospital’s &lt;a href="https://www.amtrauma.org/page/traumalevels" target="_blank"&gt;Level 1 trauma center&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h000a3b5vqxprp9g6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Just the sheer number of staff – there must have been 15 people, with the appropriate team inside the room and at the bedside,” Johns said. This included not only doctors and nurses but also blood bank runners, lab runners and many others who were ready for the child to arrive.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h000b3b5vp5x0u6yx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Trauma care takes a village,” said Dr. Katherine Hoops, who leads the Clinical Programs and Practice Team at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health’s Center for Gun Violence Solutions. Mental health professionals and social workers are also critical to have on staff for these responses, she noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h000c3b5vg6tu3kt2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Firearm injuries are the &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/guns-remain-leading-cause-of-death-for-children-and-teens" target="_blank"&gt;leading cause&lt;/a&gt; of death among children and teens in the US. Emergency medical service encounters for firearm injury spiked in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/20/health/firearm-injuries-cdc/index.html"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt; and remain higher than before the Covid-19 pandemic. Firearm suicides have continued to rise and are now &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7248a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;higher&lt;/a&gt; than at any other point in the past 50 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h000d3b5vf5k7nivi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study analyzed over 93,000 emergency department visits for firearm injury through data from the CDC’s Firearm Injury Surveillance Through Emergency Rooms, or FASTER, which collects real time data from select jurisdictions. Data from 2018 through 2023 in Florida, Georgia, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and DC was included.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h000h3b5v93czv0ze@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The analysis specifically showed that most of the patients with gunshot wounds arrived at the emergency department between 2:30 and 3 a.m., and the slowest times were between 10 and 10:30 a.m. The peaks were highest overnights from Friday into Saturday and Saturday into Sunday. The case rates were highest in July and lowest in February.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h000i3b5vt0ww0shf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although emergency departments might have adequate staff at off times, other hospital resources might be limited at night and on weekends, which could be a problem in these emergencies, Johns said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h000j3b5vh8aqo1c1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say there can still be deviations from these patterns, underscoring the importance of continued emergency room staffing. The peaks can also differ for firearm injuries in pediatric patients, Johns explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h000k3b5vgurqy7gd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The FASTER program is run through the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, a division of the CDC that was heavily targeted during federal job cuts this month.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h000l3b5vi5bn02nr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than 40 health organizations have urged US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to reinstate the center, which lost more than 200 employees, according to Sharon Gilmartin, executive director of the Safe States Alliance, which is leading the newly formed coalition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h000m3b5vjxnzhsq1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “No other federal agency collects, analyzes and links hospital and public health data sets to help illustrate a comprehensive picture of the circumstances that lead to injury and violence,” the groups wrote in a &lt;a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/67d60b72baca3a655c137808/t/67f99eefce19ad5f787f58f6/1744412399452/Letter+to+Sec+Kennedy+from+Safe+States+Alliance+041125.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to Kennedy. “State, local, municipal governments and universities rely on these data to inform the design and implementation of targeted injury and violence prevention efforts.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9ls36qn00003b5vjb5hx0nm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC says that FASTER has not been affected and continues to be operational. The database initiative was funded in 2023 through August 2028, according to the agency, but continuation of this work is contingent on future appropriations from Congress.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9ls3hqu00093b5vek8obfb2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the surveillance branch has remained intact, other research and programming staff from the center has largely been let go, according to a former employee of the &lt;strong&gt;﻿&lt;/strong&gt;National Center for Injury Prevention and Control who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9ls3hqu000a3b5vkpe7rzm3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Even if the data sets remain, they will be rendered useless because they have nobody to clean the data, analyze the data and tell you what it means,” Gilmartin said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Firearm research has been stunted for years because of the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5993413/#:~:text=For%20more%20than%2020%20years,be%20devoted%20to%20such%20research." target="_blank"&gt;Dickey Amendment&lt;/a&gt;, which was introduced in 1996 and prohibited the use of federal dollars on research that may promote gun control, according to the former National Center for Injury Prevention and Control employee. The budget for fiscal year &lt;a href="https://ysph.yale.edu/news-article/lifting-of-federal-funding-ban-tied-to-increase-in-gun-violence-research/#" target="_blank"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt; reintroduced funding for gun violence research for the CDC and the US National Institutes of Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “As a result of banning us from doing that work, the field of firearm violence is pretty far behind,” the former employee said.

            Now, experts are worried that this work could fall even further amid possible cuts laid out in an&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/16/politics/trump-rfk-jr-budget-cut-health/index.html"&gt; internal document&lt;/a&gt; reviewed by CNN last week.

            The document showed that the Trump administration is formulating plans to slash federal health spending and consolidate dozens of health programs into the Administration for a Healthy America, a new entity that Kennedy announced during the layoffs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9ls3hqu000e3b5vn4qlz72y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The plan could still change, but the document currently indicates that while some National Center for Injury Prevention and Control programs will become part of AHA’s primary care programs, others will be completely eliminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The center’s Firearm Injury and Mortality Prevention Research is among those with a zeroed-out budget in the proposal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            When Dr. Christina Johns, a pediatric emergency medicine physician, thinks about her time working at Children’s National Hospital in Washington, one case always comes rushing back:
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lt2q6000003b6oqeusk9gq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two-year-old. Gunshot wound. Chest. ETA five minutes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h00033b5v8yw15j3m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The child was rushed to the emergency department after being accidentally shot by an older sibling who was playing with a gun that was left unlocked in the house.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h00043b5vs3hsmskl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’ll never forget the … child on the stretcher and the blood-curdling screams of the parent outside the room, lying on the floor, distraught,” Johns said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h00053b5v6bk6xw1e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Every 30 minutes, an emergency department treats another firearm injury, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-02874" target="_blank"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; from researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that looked at 10 jurisdictions, including the District of Columbia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9m1rr5700013b6ow14je84m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But cuts from the US Department of Health and Human Services and proposed changes to the federal budget could threaten research that reveals these kinds of firearm injury patterns. Experts say it would be nearly impossible to replicate the scale and scope of the timely firearm research the federal government is able to conduct.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h00063b5vzcb37c32@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The recent study, which was published last week in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, says that the firearm injury visits are not evenly distributed. There were more firearm injury presentations at night, on the weekends and on some holidays, like Independence Day and New Year’s Eve.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h00073b5vlvmhd9fj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say the results are not surprising but that the findings from this analysis — which the authors say is the largest of its kind to use timely data in urban and rural areas — can inform staffing to provide better care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h00083b5vdv85n6ur@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Knowing when firearm injury emergency department visits are higher can help inform decisions about physician staffing, resource allocation, and trauma preparedness to reduce delays in care and use resources most effectively,” the CDC said in an email to CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h00093b5vr5xgc67t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Johns says the young child she treated survived because there was well-prepared staff at the hospital’s &lt;a href="https://www.amtrauma.org/page/traumalevels" target="_blank"&gt;Level 1 trauma center&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h000a3b5vqxprp9g6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Just the sheer number of staff – there must have been 15 people, with the appropriate team inside the room and at the bedside,” Johns said. This included not only doctors and nurses but also blood bank runners, lab runners and many others who were ready for the child to arrive.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h000b3b5vp5x0u6yx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Trauma care takes a village,” said Dr. Katherine Hoops, who leads the Clinical Programs and Practice Team at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health’s Center for Gun Violence Solutions. Mental health professionals and social workers are also critical to have on staff for these responses, she noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h000c3b5vg6tu3kt2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Firearm injuries are the &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/guns-remain-leading-cause-of-death-for-children-and-teens" target="_blank"&gt;leading cause&lt;/a&gt; of death among children and teens in the US. Emergency medical service encounters for firearm injury spiked in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/20/health/firearm-injuries-cdc/index.html"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt; and remain higher than before the Covid-19 pandemic. Firearm suicides have continued to rise and are now &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7248a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;higher&lt;/a&gt; than at any other point in the past 50 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h000d3b5vf5k7nivi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study analyzed over 93,000 emergency department visits for firearm injury through data from the CDC’s Firearm Injury Surveillance Through Emergency Rooms, or FASTER, which collects real time data from select jurisdictions. Data from 2018 through 2023 in Florida, Georgia, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and DC was included.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h000h3b5v93czv0ze@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The analysis specifically showed that most of the patients with gunshot wounds arrived at the emergency department between 2:30 and 3 a.m., and the slowest times were between 10 and 10:30 a.m. The peaks were highest overnights from Friday into Saturday and Saturday into Sunday. The case rates were highest in July and lowest in February.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h000i3b5vt0ww0shf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although emergency departments might have adequate staff at off times, other hospital resources might be limited at night and on weekends, which could be a problem in these emergencies, Johns said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h000j3b5vh8aqo1c1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say there can still be deviations from these patterns, underscoring the importance of continued emergency room staffing. The peaks can also differ for firearm injuries in pediatric patients, Johns explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h000k3b5vgurqy7gd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The FASTER program is run through the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, a division of the CDC that was heavily targeted during federal job cuts this month.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h000l3b5vi5bn02nr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than 40 health organizations have urged US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to reinstate the center, which lost more than 200 employees, according to Sharon Gilmartin, executive director of the Safe States Alliance, which is leading the newly formed coalition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9lnzc5h000m3b5vjxnzhsq1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “No other federal agency collects, analyzes and links hospital and public health data sets to help illustrate a comprehensive picture of the circumstances that lead to injury and violence,” the groups wrote in a &lt;a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/67d60b72baca3a655c137808/t/67f99eefce19ad5f787f58f6/1744412399452/Letter+to+Sec+Kennedy+from+Safe+States+Alliance+041125.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to Kennedy. “State, local, municipal governments and universities rely on these data to inform the design and implementation of targeted injury and violence prevention efforts.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9ls36qn00003b5vjb5hx0nm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC says that FASTER has not been affected and continues to be operational. The database initiative was funded in 2023 through August 2028, according to the agency, but continuation of this work is contingent on future appropriations from Congress.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9ls3hqu00093b5vek8obfb2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the surveillance branch has remained intact, other research and programming staff from the center has largely been let go, according to a former employee of the &lt;strong&gt;﻿&lt;/strong&gt;National Center for Injury Prevention and Control who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9ls3hqu000a3b5vkpe7rzm3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Even if the data sets remain, they will be rendered useless because they have nobody to clean the data, analyze the data and tell you what it means,” Gilmartin said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9ls3hqu000b3b5vq0edi89i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Firearm research has been stunted for years because of the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5993413/#:~:text=For%20more%20than%2020%20years,be%20devoted%20to%20such%20research." target="_blank"&gt;Dickey Amendment&lt;/a&gt;, which was introduced in 1996 and prohibited the use of federal dollars on research that may promote gun control, according to the former National Center for Injury Prevention and Control employee. The budget for fiscal year &lt;a href="https://ysph.yale.edu/news-article/lifting-of-federal-funding-ban-tied-to-increase-in-gun-violence-research/#" target="_blank"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt; reintroduced funding for gun violence research for the CDC and the US National Institutes of Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9ls3hqu000c3b5vehsj70c1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “As a result of banning us from doing that work, the field of firearm violence is pretty far behind,” the former employee said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9ls3hqu000d3b5vaebf0vxx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

I live in Manhattan, and even when I leave the building to take out the garbage or run to the corner bodega for milk, I pull on specific sweatpants and Uggs to do so. I consider this a clean, sanitary routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m also an&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/is-it-better-to-shower-in-the-morning-or-at-night-well-it-depends-goog_l_6776e451e4b0ca6c563f3565" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name=" evening shower person " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67effad6e4b06ba13d223282" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="6776e451e4b0ca6c563f3565" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt; evening shower person &lt;/a&gt;— I take one almost immediately after returning home (and before I put on my inside clothes).

Granted, most everyone in my friend group said they eventually changed clothing after arriving home, trading in what they’d been wearing outside for something more comfortable — but none of them necessarily did so because of concern for cleanliness or germ transmission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;That led me to wonder if there’s any science behind my madness.

Some people also suffer with weight loss a s a result of these symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Blood in stool is never normal. You need to get it checked out,' she urged. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colon cancer can cause blood in the stool when cancerous tumours bleed into the digestive tract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blood can sometimes be seen in the stool as a bright red, dark red or black colour, and can make the stool itself a darker, tarry shade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In early stages, it can also be present in such small amounts as to be naked to the human eye and only detectable through stool tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blood in stool does not always indicate colon cancer, however. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other conditions like haemorrhoids, irritable bowel syndrome and anal fissures can also cause the symptom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The second symptom of colon cancer in young people is unintentional weight loss, Dr Lamm added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Losing weight without trying is not normal, and could be a sign of the disease, she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unintentional weight loss can indicate a range of different cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can be caused when cancer cells and the body's reaction to them alters the metabolism, creating a loss of both fat and muscle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancerous growths release what's known as cytokines - chemicals that increase inflammation, leading to a faster metabolism and calorie burn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer cells also consume a significant amount of energy, causing the body to burn more calories at rest to support this increased demand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finally, the number one sign of colon cancer is persistent abdominal pain, says Dr Lamm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Whether it's bloating, getting full fast, or crampy abdominal pain, if it's a new symptom that persists more than four weeks, you want to get it checked out,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pain or cramping in the same place of the abdomen is particularly concerning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pain can be constant, or become more pronounced after eating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The advice I have for everyone listening is don't be afraid to talk about your poop, or look at your poop. We all should,' added Dr Lamm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MailOnline has repeatedly documented the global rise of colon cancer among young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Perhaps the most recognisable victim of the trend is Deborah James — known as 'bowel babe' — who was diagnosed at just 35 and raised millions for charity in her final days in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;James spoke of her rigorous exercise routine, and being in the best shape of her life when she developed the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Zu Rafalat, 38, of Finsbury Park, whose bloating left her looking 'six months pregnant', was horrified to be diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer. She is pictured on holiday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Rafalat, pictured riding a horse before her diagnosis, said: 'I've been fit and healthy for my entire life. I never dreamed I could get bowel cancer at my age'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another example of seemingly fit and health women being hit by the disease was Zu Rafalat, of Finsbury Park, London, who died in 2020 aged 39.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The super-fit globetrotter initially thought she had caught a stomach bug in Central America where she went on holiday in December 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But two weeks later, her stomach had become so swollen she was wearing maternity jeans, and even her GP asked if she was pregnant before prescribing IBS pills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After getting the opinion of a second, private doctor, Ms Rafalat was given CT scans which spotted a mass on her right ovary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It later turned out to be stage four bowel cancer which had spread to other organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Rafalat, who was managing director of a consultancy agency, said at the time: 'I've been fit and healthy for my entire life. I never dreamed I could get bowel cancer at my age.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistics suggest that the size of families in many countries is shrinking and a growing number of parents worldwide either willingly or unwillingly end up only having one child. While many psychology studies have explored the differences between individuals who have siblings and those who don't, the effects of not having any brothers or sisters on people's brains and behavior are not yet fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Past research has yielded varying and sometimes contradictory results, which sometimes hinted at negative effects of being an only child and other times highlighted its positive implications. In addition, these negative and positive effects were found to be inconsistent across studies, with some studies suggesting that only children tend to do better at school, are more pro-social and less problematic, while others showed the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Tianjin Medical University General Hospital and other institutes in China recently carried out a study aimed at better understanding how being an only child affects people's brain and behavior during adulthood. Their findings, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02142-4" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/i&gt;, highlight specific patterns in the brain's development and activity, as well as behavioral tendencies, that are commonly observed in adults who grew up without siblings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With the worldwide increase in only-child families, it is crucial to understand the effects of growing up without siblings (GWS) on the adult brain, behavior and the underlying pathways," Jie Tang, Jing Zhang and their colleagues wrote in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Using the CHIMGEN cohort, we investigated the associations of GWS with adult brain structure, function, connectivity, cognition, personality and mental health, as well as the pathway from GWS to GWS-related growth environments to brain and to behavior development, in 2,397 pairs of individuals with and without siblings well matched in covariates."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data collected as part of the Chinese Imaging Genetics (CHIMGEN) study, which was carried out at 32 research centers in China. They arranged the participants who met their study's selection criteria into pairs, which contained one only child and one person with siblings who had similar demographics and backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparing the brains and behaviors of these pairs of participants, the researchers were able to attain new insight into how a lack of siblings affects the brain and people's behaviors in adulthood. Interestingly, they uncovered recurring patterns among only children in the integrity of white matter, volume of the brain, neuronal activity, memory and mental health, while also unveiling characteristic behavioral phenotypes (i.e., cognitive, personality-related and behavioral tendencies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found associations linking GWS to higher language fiber integrity, lower motor fiber integrity, larger cerebellar volume, smaller cerebral volume and lower frontotemporal spontaneous brain activity," wrote Tang, Zhang and their colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Contrary to the stereotypical impression of associations between GWS and problem behaviors, we found positive correlations of GWS with neurocognition and mental health. Despite direct effects, GWS affects most brain and behavioral outcomes through modifiable environments, such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/socioeconomic+status/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;socioeconomic status&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/maternal+care/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;maternal care&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/family+support/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;family support&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting targets for interventions to enhance children's healthy growth."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recent study suggests that while being an only child can have direct effects on people's brain and behavior, most of its effects are related to the environment in which only children grow up and the stimuli they are or are not exposed to. This suggests that carefully designed interventions aimed at broadening the experiences and opportunities available to only children could help to improve their brain functions, mental health and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/behavior/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;behavior&lt;/a&gt; as adults.&lt;/p&gt;

More&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="expanded-caption"&gt; health, improved sleep, clearer thinking, and a longer life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;small&gt;getty&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol holds a paradoxical place in modern life — celebrated for its ability to enhance social connection — but also associated with health risks. What is increasingly clear is that for those aiming to optimize their long-term health and reduce alcohol health risks, quitting alcohol completely or cutting back dramatically may be one of the most impactful decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But wait, isn’t light drinking good for you?&lt;/em&gt; Yes, it’s true that decades of observational studies suggested there might be health benefits from light drinking, in particular from red wine. But what is increasingly clear is that those studies were &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessepines/2024/04/02/four-reasons-red-wine-is-no-longer-a-health-food/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessepines/2024/04/02/four-reasons-red-wine-is-no-longer-a-health-food/" target="_self" aria-label="flawed"&gt;flawed&lt;/a&gt; due to what’s called “healthy user bias”. That’s where light drinkers do better because they are wealthier, more socially connected, and more health — not because of the alcohol they’re drinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major public health organizations including the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/alcohol" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/alcohol" aria-label="World Health Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others have updated their guidance, now stating that no level of alcohol consumption is truly safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are eight science-backed reasons to consider quitting alcohol for good, or at least scaling back drinking considerably to less than one drink per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol Increases Cancer Risk — Even at Low Levels, Quitting Alcohol Reduces That Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most consistent findings is the link between alcohol and cancer. Alcohol is classified as a Class 1 carcinogen. This is the same category as tobacco and asbestos. Alcohol use has been definitively linked to at least seven types of cancer, including breast, colorectal, liver, esophageal, oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2021 study published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet Oncology&lt;/em&gt; estimated that over 740,000 new cancer cases globally in 2020 (4.1% of cases) were &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S1470-2045(21)00279-5/fulltext#:~:text=Globally%2C%20about%20741%20000%2C%20or,and%20breast%20(in%20females)." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.thelancet.com/article/S1470-2045(21)00279-5/fulltext#:~:text=Globally%2C%20about%20741%20000%2C%20or,and%20breast%20(in%20females)." aria-label="attributable"&gt;attributable&lt;/a&gt; to alcohol consumption. Even low levels of alcohol use contributes to measurable risk. For example, women consuming just one drink of alcohol per day have a 7–10% higher risk of breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quitting Alcohol Dramatically Improves Sleep Quality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While alcohol may help people fall asleep faster, it disrupts the structure and quality of sleep throughout the night. Alcohol suppresses rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, increases wakefulness in the latter half of the night, and impairs the body’s ability to enter restorative deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many, the effect is obvious. But for others, the loss of restorative sleep can be more subtle. Ask anyone who wears a sleep tracker about the type of sleep they get after a night of drinking.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The result is that even a single night of drinking can lead to daytime fatigue, poor concentration, and irritability. On the flip side, abstaining from alcohol — even for just two weeks — can improve &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessepines/2024/04/29/10-drug-free-ways-to-sleep-better-according-to-andrew-huberman/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessepines/2024/04/29/10-drug-free-ways-to-sleep-better-according-to-andrew-huberman/" target="_self" aria-label="sleep quality"&gt;sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;, reduce nighttime awakenings and enhance next-day energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Health Is Impaired By Alcohol, Quitting Alcohol Improves It&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even light drinking is associated with measurable negative effects on the brain. A 2022 study in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt; using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from over 36,000 participants found that consuming as little as &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28735-5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28735-5" aria-label="1–2 drinks per day was linked to reduced brain volume"&gt;1–2 drinks per day was linked to reduced brain volume&lt;/a&gt; and white matter integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol also interferes with the brain’s neurotransmitter systems — particularly GABA and glutamate — disrupting mood, memory and learning. Over time, alcohol accelerates brain inflammation and aging, increasing the risk of cognitive decline and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardiovascular Health Isn’t Improved With Alcohol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-held belief that moderate drinking protects the heart has been overturned by more rigorous scientific analyses. Mendelian randomization &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35333364/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35333364/" aria-label="studies"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;, which use genetic proxies to reduce confounding, have found that even light alcohol consumption increases the risk of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, stroke and heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology now both emphasize that alcohol should not be promoted for cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quitting Alcohol Can Reverse Some Liver Damage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liver is one of the organs most affected by alcohol. Regular drinking can cause fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, fibrosis (e.g. scarring) which can progress to cirrhosis as well as liver cancer. Alcohol has a number of negative health effects on the body including an increase in oxidative stress, an impairment of cellular repair and increased intestinal permeability — commonly referred to as “leaky gut” — which allows harmful endotoxins to reach the liver through the bloodstream, intensifying inflammation and damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encouragingly, the liver can begin healing quickly once alcohol intake stops. Early-stage fatty liver disease can reverse within weeks, while longer-term abstinence may even reverse some of the fibrosis. While cirrhosis is not fully reversible, abstaining from alcohol can stop its progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sexual Health Can Be Improved By Quitting Alcohol &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol affects hormonal balance in both men and women. In postmenopausal women, alcohol increases the sex hormones estradiol and testosterone while lowering sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), potentially heightening the risk of hormone-sensitive cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In men, alcohol reduces testosterone and raises estrogen. This can contribute to infertility, low libido and even be a direct cause of erectile dysfunction. Alcohol also disrupts stress hormone (i.e. cortisol regulation) and can contribute to thyroid dysfunction as well as immune suppression. Most of these disruptions begin to normalize soon after alcohol cessation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diminished Immune Function Can Be Improved By Quitting Alcohol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol weakens both the innate and adaptive immune systems. It impairs neutrophil, macrophage, monocyte, and lymphocyte function while promoting chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even a single episode of binge drinking can dampen immune responsiveness. Conversely, quitting alcohol has been shown to improve immune function within weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quitting Alcohol Reduces Alcohol Health Risks And Increase Longevity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol is linked to premature death. A 2018 Lancet &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39455599/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39455599/" aria-label="study"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that included data from nearly 600,000 people found that each additional daily drink reduced life expectancy by over a year. In men, each drink reduced lifespan by nearly one and a half years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, despite its widespread social acceptance, alcohol is a known toxin that negatively affects nearly every system in the body. There are myriad, clear alcohol health risks that can be improved by quitting drinking altogether or lowering alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From increasing cancer risk, heart disease, and dementia, to disrupting sleep, hormones, and immunity, alcohol is far from the benign, daily drink it was once thought to be. As the science continues to evolve, one message grows louder: for those pursuing long-term vitality and resilience, quitting alcohol is not just wise. It’s evidence-based self-care.&lt;/p&gt;

And it turns out that those with the longest-lived citizens share one common trait: They consume more plant-based proteins. At least as adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To come to this conclusion, the team at the Charles Perkins Center analyzed food supply and demographic data over a 60-year period (from 1961 to 2018) for 101 countries. The data encompassed information on the amount of food produced in each country as well as the average levels of calories, proteins, and fats available to citizens. The researchers also aimed to ensure that the selected countries were as regionally diverse as possible to reflect a variety of food systems and cuisines, including regions with higher animal protein consumption (notably, the U.S. and Australia) and areas where plants serve as the primary source of protein, such as Pakistan and Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/daily-coffee-consumption-prolongs-lifespan-8768290" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Drinking Coffee Could Add Years to Your Life, According to a New Study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Drinking Coffee Could Add Years to Your Life, According to a New Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the team corrected the data to "account for population size and wealth." In doing so, they found that "countries where overall availability of plant-based proteins were higher, such as India, had relatively longer life expectancies than countries where animal-based proteins were more readily available, such as the U.S."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In examining the data, they found an interesting subset of information. According to first author Caitlin Andrews, they discovered that the data indicated regions where children under five were fed more animal-based protein had lower infant mortality rates. However, she added, "for adults, the reverse was true, where plant-based proteins increased overall life expectancy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a release regarding their study, the researchers noted that there are plenty of other studies out there showcasing that plant proteins like those found in nuts, tofu, and legumes are associated with lower risks of chronic diseases, which could also explain why plant-loving places like Ikaria, Greece, and Loma Linda in California — home to the 7th Day Adventists who do not consume meat — are home to some of the longest-lived populations on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if you don't want to swear off animal-based protein forever, there are small changes you can make that could help add a few years to your life. Just a few weeks ago, researchers from Mass General Brigham, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and the Broad Institute released the findings of their study in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, which showed that making the simple swap from&lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/butter-vs-plant-based-oils-mortality-harvard-study-11705242" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk: butter to plant-based oils;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; butter to plant-based oils&lt;/a&gt; like olive oil could help you live a bit longer, too. It found that participants who consumed the most butter had a 15% higher risk of dying than those who consumed the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Protein is a crucial part of the human diet, but as eating habits change and developed countries look to decarbonize, where we get our protein from has come under greater scrutiny," Dr. Alistair Senior from the Charles Perkins Center study explained. "The knowledge that plant-based protein is associated with a longer life is really important as we consider not only how our diets impact our own longevity, but the health of the planet."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/plant-based-proteins-longevity-study-11718446" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Food &amp;amp; Wine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Food &amp;amp; Wine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 09:52:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFA0NkVNZFJMamR0VDBtNUFpdDJJR1poX2VvUkhidm9pLTYzeTdzcGtpam1KUFVZdjhSR00xM0I1aDVTeFp1OENEV0Y3WEcySTFJcGpKTG1lYmNmVjZKbFF4MWNCellNSUpoUnl1Q1dTVlg</guid></item><item><title>首先是蛋白质，然后是纤维。膳食排序背后的科学以及如何做到这一点。-雅虎 | First protein, then fiber.

Rapid increases in blood sugar can trigger dopamine release, which makes you feel good. This can cause cravings for highly palatable foods that are high in fat and sugar and in some cases, can lead to &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5912158/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:food addiction;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;food addiction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Stable blood sugars reduce hunger fluctuations and cravings for sweets or snacks,” Shah says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meal sequencing aids weight loss efforts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The eating strategy may improve obesity thanks to enhanced GLP-1 secretion, which suppresses appetite and may reduce energy intake.

Which is to say: It’s still pretty far away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;That’s not for lack of trying. Some researchers are attempting to &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00183-2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;reprogram cells&lt;/a&gt; to make them biologically younger, which has been shown to reverse features of aging in older animals. Unfortunately, this can also induce cancer. Other researchers are studying drugs called &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047637423001148" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;senolytics&lt;/a&gt;, which aim to clear aging cells out of the body. However, they can also destroy other cells humans need to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Transfusions of blood from young mice appear to rejuvenate older mice, but companies offering this unproven treatment for humans are charging a lot for a potentially dangerous therapy. And while some longevity enthusiasts are &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/well/live/rapamycin-aging-longevity-benefits-risks.html" title=""&gt;taking the drug rapamycin&lt;/a&gt; because studies have shown it helps animals live longer, it also weakens the immune system and hasn’t been proved to work in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;I find these efforts intriguing and worth pursuing. But most people don’t simply want to live until 110. They want to extend the amount of time they live free of serious disease, a concept known as health span. That’s why the most sensible approach is to reduce the toll of three major age-related diseases: cancer, heart disease and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease. It may be less flashy, but it’s more attainable than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It’s estimated that at least 80 percent of cardiovascular disease cases, 40 percent of cancer cases and 45 percent of Alzheimer’s cases are preventable. Even with a long lag — these diseases can each take 20 years or more to develop — researchers have struggled to accurately define a person’s risk early enough to intervene effectively. Sure, someone can take a genetic test and learn he’s at a heightened risk for Alzheimer’s disease, but what good is that if he doesn’t know whether the disease will emerge early, when he’s 95 or not at all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In the near future, doctors may not only be able to identify whether a person is at high risk for a serious, age-related disease, they may also be able to predict when that disease is most likely to manifest and how quickly it could progress. Several recent discoveries from the science of aging are making this increasingly possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

These hormones can increase blood sugar levels by prompting the liver to release more glucose into the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="shortEntryContainer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Type 2 diabetes response:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In individuals with type 2 diabetes, stress often leads to elevated blood sugar levels. This is because stress hormones can make the body more resistant to insulin, hindering glucose uptake by cells. &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/world-diabetes-day-how-diabetes-can-affect-your-mental-health-101636714847972.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="World Diabetes Day: How diabetes can affect your mental health"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World Diabetes Day: How diabetes can affect your mental health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Type 1 diabetes response:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those with type 1 diabetes, stress can cause unpredictable blood sugar fluctuations. Some may experience increases, while others may see decreases, making management more challenging.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Physical stressors:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illness, injury, or surgery can act as physical stressors, leading to increased blood sugar levels. The body's stress response during these times can complicate diabetes management.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Behavioural changes:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress can influence behaviours that negatively impact blood sugar control. People might neglect their diabetes care routines, skip medications, make poor dietary choices, or reduce physical activity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Insulin resistance:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic stress can contribute to insulin resistance, where the body's cells don't respond effectively to insulin. This condition is a significant factor in the development and progression of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Emotional well-being:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persistent stress can lead to feelings of burnout, anxiety, or depression. These emotional states can further hinder diabetes management by reducing motivation and adherence to treatment plans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Monitoring challenges:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress can interfere with regular blood sugar monitoring. Individuals may forget to check their levels or misinterpret symptoms, leading to inadequate glycemic control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Long-term complications:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unmanaged stress and resulting high blood sugar levels can increase the risk of diabetes-related complications, including cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, and kidney issues. &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/diabetes-warning-stress-could-be-sabotaging-your-blood-sugar-here-s-how-to-fix-it-101738407141209.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Diabetes warning: Stress could be sabotaging your blood sugar.

He was executed by electric chair in January 1989 in Florida (pictured in 1978)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking when the research was published in 2018, lead author, Dr Dan Burley, from Cardiff University's School of Psychology, said: 'Our findings provide physical evidence of an emotional deficit common to psychopathic offenders.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The pupil has long been known to be an indicator of a person's arousal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Card sharks have learnt to look carefully at the eyes of their opponents to gauge if they have a great hand, and many an astute salesperson knows to up their price if your eyes reveal your excitement at their product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Likewise, the pupil usually dilates when an image shocks or scares us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The fact that this normal physiological response to threat is reduced in psychopathic offenders provides us with an obvious physical marker for this condition.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pupil dilation in the eyes the psychopaths was abnormal when looking at distressing scenes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, researchers were surprised to see that their pupils dilated when looking at positive pictures, just as the pupils of non-psychopaths do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result of these findings, the scientists suggested this indicates that psychopathy is not associated with an overall difficulty in responding to emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Serial killer Fred West, who has been described as a psychopath, is believed to have killed at least 12 people. He didn't stand trial for the murders as he took his own life in 1995 before the case was tried (pictured with Rose West)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Richard Ramirez, also known as the 'Night Stalker', was convicted of 13 murders in 1989. While on death row in in San Quentin prison in California, he died of natural causes in 2013, aged 59 (pictured during a court appearance in Los Angeles in 1985)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rather, they said, it suggests a specific insensitivity to threatening information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Nicola Gray is a clinical and forensic psychologist from Swansea University, who provided clinical supervision for the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking at the time, she said: 'This is one of the first times we have objective, physiological, evidence of an emotional deficit underpinning the offending behaviour of psychopathic offenders that does not depend on invasive methods or expensive equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We hope to be able to develop this methodology to assist with clinical assessment and intervention in offender populations.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Robert Snowden from Cardiff University said that many psychopathic offenders appear to be bold, confident, and can act in cold-blooded manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'It's much easier to act bold if you have no feelings of fear, and to be cold-blooded if there is no emotion to get in the way of the act.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The term psychopath is not a diagnosis, and while some people believe it is the same as antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), according to Dr David Tzall, a licensed psychologist, they are not the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking to&lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://psychcentral.com/health/identifying-psychopathic-stare#what-is-it"&gt; Psych Central&lt;/a&gt;, he said that the two conditions are 'similar in scope but different in terms of details' describing ASPD as 'a diagnosable personality disorder characterised by a pervasive pattern of disregard for the rights of others, the safety of themselves and others, impulsivity, and socially accepted norms and rules'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, he said: '&lt;span&gt;Psychopathy is a personality construct that describes a set of interpersonal, affective, and behavioural traits that are similar to those observed in ASPD.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox femail" data-version="2" id="mol-008854d0-1b9f-11f0-8441-3dda5c39a3bc" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-14622079/tell-tale-body-language-sign-away-psychopath.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;WOULD YOU KNOW HOW TO SPOT A PSYCHOPATH?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;font&gt;Psychopaths display different traits depending on their disorder.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;font&gt;Common signs include superficial charm, a grandiose notion of self-worth, the need for stimulation and impulsiveness, pathological lying, the ability to manipulate others and a lack of remorse and empathy.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;font&gt;But despite the popular association, not all psychopaths become killers.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Experts claim &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="class"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;people usually find psychopaths intriguing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="class"&gt;, but can't put their finger on why. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;This is down to incongruous behaviour because psychopaths tend to do a lot of acting to deceive, or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;mimic normal reactions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;, sometimes changing their views and reactions quickly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;font&gt;For example, Self-professed psychopath Jacob Wells said that upon meeting someone, he tries to become 'the most interesting person they know' and presumably &lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;adopts suitable interests&lt;/span&gt; and responses to do this.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;font&gt;His response also gives away another common trait - a grandiose notion of self-worth - in that he can be the most interesting person in the room.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;font&gt;Psychopaths occasionally tend to exhibit &lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;unconvincing emotional responses&lt;/span&gt;, with slip-ups including tone of voice or body language.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;font&gt;This may be because they are unable to understand emotions such as fear and love, but can mimic them.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;Generally psychopaths' 'emotions' are shallow and short-lived and there is a manipulative ulterior motive to showing them.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;For example, Mr Wells said he &lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;offers to do favours and tells false secrets&lt;/span&gt; to people to gain their complete trust.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;He also displays &lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;insincere charm&lt;/span&gt; - another trait associated with psychopaths.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;He says: 'I keep secrets, and tell them fake secrets to further gain their trust, and once they trust me enough, I ask for favours, reminding them of the favours I did them. I can get literally anything from them, which is incredibly useful.'&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;Psychopaths typically display an &lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;incredible ability to manipulate others&lt;/span&gt; and sometimes take pleasure in doing so. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;Psychopaths often have an air of &lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;superiority&lt;/span&gt; about them, perhaps shown by Mr Wells' belief he can spot other psychopaths&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;Even expert Dr Hare, who came up with the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) used as a diagnostic tool to determine where someone lies on the psychopathy spectrum, warns that anyone can be duped during a short interaction with a psychopath.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 07:12:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPMG5uY0d3TkVGSTZsYTlReVFPUU9IVkVHZGJpU1lWb1AyWFNwZW5GbEliTzh3SmtEak51REY0UFRZaHhkejVldGVyTldseDNQMXRUUUNlUUVzUGdJRnRMUjUtcHRndExJUFhmRWZUcFVydnJZNm9VWlVZZElsME9TSWxfMXdwN0RiOGVBY0Q5bEt4Y0hXS3pDQ1NKSWJWcF83ZThr0gGoAUFVX3lxTFBsQ3JBNmc0SE0yMm9xRkR3d2lpMnM2eWJWcmNXSkFjcGlrcEJ2RVhIT3lvaVVEQTV1MGthNVFwMmRzQVFrd3IwZlZ1Q3VNVkMtTURTUWZLd21VVHQ5Z05EVFpoZGlYczRBYmZKRjl1QXpUdlF5a3RhLUJ3R0JkT3VpYWlBLWRobm5SenVLY1g1eHZ1c25ZclhEOXhILTFpRXprRENVanFVRA</guid></item><item><title>“如果我可以选择五个动作来保证未来的身体，那就是这些动作” -一位培训师说，这种长寿锻炼将帮助您建立持久的力量和行动能力- Fit&amp;Well | "If I could choose just five moves to future-proof my body, these would be it"—A trainer says this longevity workout will help you build lasting strength and mobility - Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivgJBVV95cUxNYkFkdzJYR0Y0TWQwRVA3MDRBQ2hHNHNsTUE5OE83TG9HV3ZyYi1pVmpIaFcyY05UbjlXUGV3M1lCTXY5NlgwcmxDV3NtNjE1SF9YNGhTT3lQVXF6UEx0djJzMHp3ekUwWkIxQXhsVUxYTlM2U3JEemI2V1pFTW92UFhFSlp2R3ppcVJOR2pmTjZNN2pmSlZfQTlhbWNrWGI1ZVlyTmhjWUl5aGoyR25ibTZmQ3FvWnRYdmhPZ3VXYWRnOEZpMFdrVmd5UWpudmFRdzd5V3RZSWZvNmc3eVJ6cFU1MDVQclh3SG5ZT0ljRnoxTUJFbnJWSWcya3JPWEllbHprdmJUY2VlamlzN2JsQ09OQVg0TGVSd2thUVpKcU5SOGxfTWE0Vkt1akxZN1FrMXhwR3I1VEg3R29ka0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;

Worried you’re not going to be able to? Enter the deadlift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Deadlifts target the posterior chain such as hamstrings, glutes and back while strengthening the hips and core,” says Sacerdoti. “This is one of the best moves for building full-body strength, especially the muscles that protect your lower back and improve posture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-row"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.

We can emulate a little of their day-to-day in the gym with the ultimate functional move: the farmer carry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The farmer carry challenges grip, core, shoulders, and legs. It stimulates daily movements [like carrying groceries or bags] and builds total-body strength, improving posture and coordination.”&lt;/p&gt;

The knot can cause pain in the shoulder and neck, as well as a decrease in range of motion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-emily-mouu-s-routine-for-shoulder-knots"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do Emily Mouu's routine for shoulder knots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only equipment you'll need for this routine is two small towels, which you'll use to slide your hands around during the stretches. A yoga mat is optional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This works best on hard floors, but I prefer to stretch on carpet, so I used my &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bettermelimited.sjv.io/c/221109/1996791/24569?subId1=fitandwell-gb-1080746296116280910&amp;amp;sharedId=fitandwell-gb&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.betterme.world%2Fproducts%2Fpilates-sliders-pink%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOorpTpSydVd1OKTkBsmQdraSB5OgRwGRkUZOV_yAzRYwmhsYh1Km" target="_blank" data-url="https://store.betterme.world/products/pilates-sliders-pink?srsltid=AfmBOorpTpSydVd1OKTkBsmQdraSB5OgRwGRkUZOV_yAzRYwmhsYh1Km" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://bettermelimited.sjv.io/c/221109/1996791/24569?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;sharedId=hawk-prefix&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.betterme.world%2Fproducts%2Fpilates-sliders-pink%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOorpTpSydVd1OKTkBsmQdraSB5OgRwGRkUZOV_yAzRYwmhsYh1Km" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="BetterMe" data-merchant-id="495606" data-merchant-network="ImpactRad" data-merchant-url="betterme.world"&gt;BetterMe Pilates sliders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ZrkcdgGTdyQfmmMtJzefQE" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ZrkcdgGTdyQfmmMtJzefQE slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I completed eight repetitions of each exercise and did the entire routine twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-can-stretching-really-help-with-shoulder-knots"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Can stretching really help with shoulder knots?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've lived with shoulder knots for a long time, it might feel like there's nothing, besides a great massage, that will really get rid of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But according to physical therapist at Complete Pilates &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://complete-pilates.co.uk/meet-the-team/helen-oleary/" target="_blank" data-url="https://complete-pilates.co.uk/meet-the-team/helen-oleary/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Helen O'Leary&lt;/a&gt;, stretching can be beneficial. “Stretches can help with knots in some cases, as they relieve feelings of muscle tension,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is also some evidence that active stretching helps fluid to move through fascia, the fibrous tissue that encases muscles,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important that if you are experiencing pain that affects your everyday life to consult a health professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Leary says it's important to not push through any pain when stretching: “Make sure you are choosing the right stretch for the right area and not overstretching or forcing the stretch, as this could make things worse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-experience"&gt;&lt;span&gt;My experience&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was skeptical that these moves could actually help with my shoulder knots. I often try to release tension in my shoulders by stretching, and although certain stretches feel great while I'm doing them, the discomfort tends to return very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These movements were different. They did provide some relief, but they also challenged my strength and mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the sliders meant that I had to actively engage my shoulder muscles to move with control through a full range of motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a fitness writer who has tried what feels like every stretch under the sun, I was surprised—this felt like a new way to mobilize my shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After I'd completed the routine, which took less than ten minutes, my muscles felt more relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can't say that my shoulder knots disappeared—I could still feel them if I gently massaged the area—but I was experiencing far less discomfort when I went back to my desk, which was a huge win.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ll definitely continue with these moves to stabilize and mobilize my shoulder muscles, and I'd recommend them to anyone dealing with shoulder knots or tightness in their upper body.&lt;/p&gt;

'But for the first time, I’m kind of stepping outside of my comfort zone and letting go of my past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘So it is a really big deal for me.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The decision follows a years-long, harrowing ordeal that saw Maya lose not only her mother but, for a time, her freedom – all while suffering from a rare condition that debilitates her to this day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, the eloquent and soft-spoken teenager is taking more control over her life – and her healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;An agonizing condition that baffled doctors  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At nine years old, Maya started suffering mystery symptoms such as lesions, asthma attacks and lower-limb muscle contractions. She was in constant pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specialist Dr. Anthony Kirkpatrick diagnosed the young girl in 2015 with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), an extremely rare neurological condition that causes acute sensitivity to even the slightest touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Kirkpatrick recommended ketamine infusion treatments for the pain - they noticeably helped. He also suggested a more intense procedure involving an induced coma that - after days of research - the family decided to travel to Mexico to try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She showed signs of improvement, but severe abdominal pain in 2016 sent Maya to the ER at Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital (JHACH) in St. Petersburg, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Beata requested ketamine as treatment for Maya, doctors refused to administer the drug. And when she further explained that it was recommended by a doctor and the only remedy they'd found, then demanded it for her daughter, Maya was taken from her parents' custody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Beata was then accused of having &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9834-factitious-disorder-imposed-on-another-fdia"&gt;Munchausen syndrome by proxy&lt;/a&gt; (MSbP) - a mental health condition where the affected falsely acts like someone within their care is sick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maya is leaving behind her home state altogether, along with the painful memories it holds of her mother’s death and her own medical kidnapping&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maya was just 10 years old when she went to hospital with a debilitating pain. Doctors accused her mother of abuse and Maya didn't see her for 87 days &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The story of Maya's medical kidnapping and the agonizing journey that drove her mother Beata (second from right) to death is the focus of the harrowing Netflix documentary 'Take Care of Maya'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She underwent a court-ordered psychological evaluation which determined she did not have MSbP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, Maya remained in the custody of the state and, for months, was allowed only minimal contact with her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While confined to her hospital bed in December 2016, Maya wrote a letter to the judge overseeing her case, outlining in excruciating detail how she was in more pain and begging him to let her see her family over Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maya's lawyer also asked the court if there was 'any way' she could simply see her mother to give her a hug, but the judge refused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She only saw her mother once over the 87 days – when Maya appeared in court in January 2017 for a dependency hearing, where a judge would consider if she could return to her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maya was in a wheelchair, and her family and legal team said she was looking 'worse' than ever, despite almost three months in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Beata died by suicide 48 hours later, believing that removing herself as a perceived obstacle was the only way to get her daughter better care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family sued JHACH, accusing the hospital of medical malpractice, false imprisonment and intentional infliction of emotional distress among other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were stunned when they found staff had billed their insurance for 174 CRPS treatments - a remedy for the condition they’d accused her mother of manufacturing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Five months after Take Care of Maya’s streaming premiere, a Florida jury found the hospital had falsely imprisoned Maya and contributed to her mother's death - the Kowalskis were awarded $261 million in damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The amount was later reduced to $213.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A judge struck down the hospital’s demand for a retrial. JHACH is appealing the decision, insisting they were not responsible for Beata's death because she wasn't in their care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maya started learning the piano at three years old with her mother's support. A natural performer, she is now hoping to put her ordeal behind her by moving to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Trying to put her traumatic childhood behind her  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maya tries not to dwell on the experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We have a limited time on this Earth,' she says profoundly, 'and why would I want to spend even a fraction of that thinking about the worst things that have happened to me?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, she looks to the future, focuses on spirituality and meditates overlooking the lake and private dock behind the Florida home she has been sharing with her father and younger brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to concentrating on mental health, Maya does physical therapy exercises in her family’s pool. But her pain has still not completely gone away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I have my moments where it is worse, and I always get really scared,' she tells the Daily Mail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My biggest fear is being as sick as I used to be, but I am starting to do the things I know work for my pain management and promising myself that I’m going to take care of my physical being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I feel like the work has paid off. I’m walking.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, she has limitations. She tried figure skating again – something she’d enjoyed doing with her mother – but ‘noticed the pain was getting a little bit uncontrollable’ and stopped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nowadays, Maya says, she’ll feel pain in her leg and lower back and ‘randomly’ in her left wrist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A few months before her 19th birthday, she moved with her father and brother to Odessa, 95 miles north of the home she grew up in, to mark a new beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maya still has ‘beautiful memories’ from her old house, but couldn’t escape the fact that it was where her mother died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s like every day I was reminded that she had killed herself,’ she says. ‘It was time for a change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Also, people in the community started to notice us for our traumatic history,' she recalled, adding that she has 'a hard time' when people she doesn't know have preconceived notions about her based off 'the worst part of my life.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In addition to concentrating on mental health, Maya does physical therapy exercises in her family’s pool. But her pain has still not completely gone away&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Healing through pursuing her passion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Immediately after the move farther north, Maya didn’t know what to do with herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She’d earlier been accepted into the University of Miami and planned to study business marketing, but also considered becoming a homicide detective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ultimately, she decided to forego the classroom completely for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I think I would be a lot more stable just starting my life as an adult, as opposed to going to school and then worrying about what people think of me,’ she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘From an emotional maturity standpoint, I definitely am a few years above average – which I see as a gift now, but it has been hard to cope with,’ she tells the Daily Mail. ‘I feel like an alien most of the time.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She’s also emerging from what she calls ‘one consistent' eight-year-long depressive episode where the trauma kept piling up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was ‘during a depressive episode’ after moving to Odessa that Maya leaned into a talent and passion that’s now sending her life in a new direction: the performing arts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I looked up things in the [Odessa] area, and I found an acting studio,’ she tells the Daily Mail. ‘It was the first time I had genuinely laughed and smiled in a long time.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A natural performer, she wanted to be a pop singer as a child and, with her mother's support, started learning piano at three years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I remember going to her about it, and she took it upon herself to educate herself on the very basics before putting me in class,’ says Maya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Beata would listen to her daughter play while working and ‘found it very relaxing,’ Maya says. There’s a Yamaha baby grand in the pristine white living room of their new home that she likes to play at sunset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She’d been taking vocal coaching twice a week up until recently but hasn’t performed much publicly since her mother’s death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When I sing, I think of her… it’s very emotional for me,’ she says. ‘I always end up crying.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has focused on acting - something she used to love doing in school productions until she got sick - and found it a very effective outlet for channeling her pain and emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I’ve only been acting for four months, and… I have so much room to grow,’ she says. ‘I don’t think I’m that great; I feel that I’m decent… but I know one of the silver linings of everything I’ve been through is that it has added so much life experience – and that life experience, I think, is more beneficial than talent, or what other people call talent, because it’s real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When you’re able to excavate those emotions and apply them to these projects, it’s actually very healing, as well,' she said, adding that it's allowed her to let go of some anger, sadness and hurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She considers this catharsis a 'privilege.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I’m able to have this outlet to kind of project all of it in a healthy way... I’ve gotten to this place where I feel very grounded. I feel very calm,’ Maya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Obviously, I still struggle with sadness and anger and frustration, but the difference is, I have a coping mechanism – and for all people, at the end of the day, you have to learn how to forgive.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maya can now frequently be found filming audition tapes or flying to jobs. Despite her newbie status, she’s already worked on projects that include a YouTube comedy series, a Hallmark movie and a dystopian short film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'One day, I want to be in a feature film,' she says. 'And I just want to feel that I'm making movies that matter.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some collaborators know her history, such as the director who cast her as 'girl who’d lost her mother'. Others have no idea. And when it comes to genre, Maya says she does ‘gravitate towards drama, horror and dark comedy.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The acting community has also introduced her to a new circle of ‘soul friends’ she would never have expected getting close to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I actually feel like they are my best friends,’ she says. ‘It’s hard to find people here (in Florida) that I could connect with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Beata took her own life in the garage of the family home in Florida after only seeing Maya once in 87 days  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And these people have gone through a range of things as well. So I think, the collective of their experiences and mine - we just have a different type of bond.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;The unbreakable bond with her father and brother  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her strongest bond, though, seems to still be with her brother, Kyle, who’s now 17 and keeping out of sight in Odessa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I think the trials of our life have bonded us together, and even though we’ve experienced them from very different angles, we still have that underlying understanding of pain,’ she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kyle and Jack&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; accompanied Maya to California in February to help find a place for her to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The trip coincided with Beata’s birthday - she would have turned 52 this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The trio celebrates the day together every year, whether it be with dinner, a cake or Beata’s favorite, gelato - this time, they found somewhere in LA where they could enjoy it in her memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the immediate aftermath of her mother’s death, Maya says, ‘we talked about her a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And then I think when the trial happened, we all got very quiet – because long days, emotionally taxing days, and then we all had to decompress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Now we still talk about her, and we’ll share memories, but it’s always in a really positive light.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Keeping her mother's memory alive  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family will recall expressions and words Beata would use, fondly remembering things she loved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are echoes of their matriarch throughout the new home – whether it be her rosary, which Maya keeps within easy reach on her bedroom desk, or their dog's middle name. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They brought Chelsea Benya Kowalski - a Yorkie - home in the aftermath of the suicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The middle name ‘doesn’t make sense to a lot of people,' Maya explained, 'but it’s a nickname in Polish for Beata.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During moments of doubt and difficulty, it’s her mother’s spirit that Maya tries to channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I obviously wish she was still here,' the teen says. But she remembers her mother as 'so bold and audacious and brave – and no BS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maya holds her mother's rosary at the home she is preparing to leave. She has tried to channel Beata's drive as she takes the bold step to move across the country&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘She was very goal-driven, and… she had this self-respect that I admire so much.

And whenever I’m feeling uneasy or self-doubt creeps in, I try to picture my mom and think, “What would she do? She wouldn’t be bothered by this. She would stand her ground and be who she is, regardless of what anyone says."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The young adult hopes to memorialize her mother in other ways, too, through a dream totally separate from but just as important as her acting goals: She wants to do some type of charitable work helping others with chronic illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Once my court is wrapped up and once I’m situated, I would love to start putting in some plans to make this happen.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She believes here mother 'would be on board' fully with those charitable efforts, which 'would be so important to her emotionally' given the trauma that devastated the Kowalskis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maya says she'll 'do my best to live up to that’ passion and devotion so strongly exhibited by her mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maya says she'll 'do my best to live up to that’ passion and devotion so strongly exhibited by her mother, almost a decade after her life was upended &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the teen remains, remarkably, philosophical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Sometimes bad things need to happen for progress to be made,’ she tells the Daily Mail. ‘And I look at my situation, and if I was the person that had to go through all this bad stuff, so be it.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maya says that while she largely doesn't pay attention to social media comments, she sometimes takes a peek. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And when she sees social workers, nurses, doctors or anyone in the medical field leaving positive words, it's gratifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I’ve been told that my documentary is used to educate medical professionals, and I can’t even begin to express how happy that makes me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This really negative thing happened, sure – but the people who need to hear it most… they’re learning from it,' she says.

But we do need to acknowledge that, in a small subset of individuals... there may be a risk of persistent symptoms post-vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These patients shouldn’t be dismissed. Just because something is rare doesn’t mean it’s not real.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Below, the Daily Mail reveals the symptoms research has linked to vaccines and what to do if you experience them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The previously-unknown condition, dubbed 'post-vaccination syndrome' (PVS), can persist years after taking the mRNA vaccines— made by the likes of Pfizer and Moderna&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A 2024 study looked at the conditions most associated with Covid vaccinations. Heart issues like pericarditis and myocarditis were most often linked to the shots &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Neurological symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Yale researchers reported that PVS is characterized by symptoms such as headaches, dizziness and 'brain fog'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who experience these symptoms may suffer from debilitating head pain, feeling faint, weak or unsteady, confusion, thinking difficulty, problems with concentration and diminishing memory.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This group of symptoms are among the most common and usually develop within 48 hours of receiving a vaccine and become more severe in the following days and weeks, and can persist over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2022 study by UK researchers found the most frequently reported adverse events after receiving the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca in the UK were headaches, cluster headaches, migraines and dizziness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the PVS patients analyzed by the Yale researchers, brain fog was reported in 78 percent of people and difficulty concentrating or focusing was reported by 73 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate 2024 analysis found brain fog was reported in about one in 1,000 doses of an mRNA Covid vaccine - such as Pfizer's - and 56 in 1,000 doses of an adenoviral vector vaccine - such as Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson/Janssen's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while headaches can be common side effects of vaccines, a 2021 study found headaches post Covid vaccine could be a sign of cerebral venous thrombosis - deadly blood clots that form in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Zoe Lees, who studies metabolic medicine, told the Daily Mail that it is 'common' to have headaches or dizziness after a vaccine but they typically resolve in a short timeframe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: These symptoms are more likely to be due to the body's immune response rather than direct damage to nerves. Severe or frequent symptoms are extremely rare'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she added: 'If symptoms [last] more than a few weeks, it is appropriate to seek further evaluation.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For people experiencing headaches or migraines, treatment can include over-the-counter pain medication or prescription drugs, as well as lifestyle and diet changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatments for symptoms like dizziness, confusion and difficulty concentrating can vary widely based on the individual and people typically have to trial and error multiple therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Exercise intolerance &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yale researchers found exercise intolerance was among the most commonly reported symptom of people with PVS — with 80 percent of people suffering from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And a 2023 preprint paper found exercise intolerance was suffered by 71 percent of people reporting PVS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise intolerance is characterized by the inability or struggle to perform physical activity at a person's desired intensity or at the same caliber they exercised at prior to receiving a Covid vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This may manifest as running out of breath sooner than usual or being too tired to start or complete a work out. People may also experience muscle weakness, aches or pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to being linked to PVS, exercise intolerance has also been associated with long Covid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yale researchers discovered that, in people experiencing exercise intolerance, despite the heart and lungs functioning normally, the body isn't able to properly extract and use oxygen from the blood as fuel that would normally allow a person to perform at their highest ability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There aren't many options for treating the condition, but doctors may prescribe high-dose vitamins and a medication used to treat muscle weakness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Fatigue and difficulty sleeping &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 2023 preprint found excessive fatigue was experienced by 69 percent of people reporting PVS and the Yale researchers report 85 percent of people with PVS experienced the symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, 70 percent of PVS patients had trouble falling or staying asleep, according to the Yale researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the 2022 UK study reported poor quality sleep among the most frequently reported side effects after receiving a Covid vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2023 study examining the relationship between sleep and the Covid vaccines found people who experienced vaccine side effects had less and worse sleep than people who experienced no side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thirteen percent of people had moderate to severe insomnia. Nearly four percent had trouble falling asleep; 6.8 percent couldn't stay asleep; and 7.4 percent were consistently waking up too early. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while brain fog is a PVS symptom itself, lack of or poor sleep can contribute to it, making it harder to concentrate and think. It can also lead to mood changes like irritability and depression and cause an increased risk of obesity, heart disease and &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-f383e740-1a27-11f0-8183-9dc3b1229fb2" class=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adequate sleep is crucial for the body to repair itself and for the immune system, helping to strengthen it to fend off viruses. People with PVS who suffer from poor sleep may be at a greater risk for other medical issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To treat sleep problems, doctors may recommend medications, talk therapy, or changes to a person's lifestyle and diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Lees told the Daily Mail fatigue is also one of the most common side effects of getting a vaccine but it should subside within one to two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, if someone is still struggling with the symptom for more than six weeks, 'supportive treatment is offered in post-viral syndrome clinics.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rory Nairn (pictured here), a 26-year-old from New Zealand, died from myocarditis 12 days after receiving his first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine in 2021&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Myocarditis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle (myocardium) that can reduce the heart's ability to pump blood effectively, potentially leading to heart failure, abnormal heartbeat and at times, sudden death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is usually caused by by a viral infection and there are less than 200,000 US cases per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with myocarditis may experience chest pain or tightness, shortness of breath, fatigue and loss of energy, swollen legs and irregular heartbeats.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In rare cases, mRNA shots have been shown to cause myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis, inflammation of the sac-like lining surrounding the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The side effect is rare but exactly how rare is still being debated. A major 2021 study in Israel put the rate at one in 50,000. Other studies have come to vastly different estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jared Ross, an emergency medicine physician and medical school professor, told the Daily Mail post-vaccine myocarditis is more common in males than females, especially under the age of 30. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said the condition typically develops after a viral infection, but can be triggered by a vaccine - most commonly the Moderna Covid vaccine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CDC data shows post-vaccine myocarditis and pericarditis - inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart - are established side effects of Covid vaccination, though the agency does not provide a number of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the conditions, it's thought the immune system may register mRNA in Covid vaccines as a threat, leading it to attack itself and cause inflammation of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both conditions have also been linked to Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in January 2025, Canadian experts began calling for more &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14329779/covid-vaccine-research-heart-effects-new-study.html"&gt;research into heart damage linked to Covid vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They noted that the scale of the issue remains 'under-documented' due to the studies being too narrow and haven't looked at the risk of these injuries months and years after receiving the shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers from British Columbia also warn that these studies have been inconsistent in how they classify 'postvaccine' myocarditis and pericarditis, using different timeframes to define if the conditions were directly linked to the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment for myocarditis includes medications, lifestyle adjustments, rest, surgery or a heart transplant in severe cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dr Ross said: 'Thankfully, most patients fully recover.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tinnitus is a hearing problem that most commonly takes the form of persistent ringing in the ears&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Tinnitus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tinnitus is a hearing problem that most commonly takes the form of persistent ringing in the ears. It can also sound like buzzing, roaring, hissing, or clicking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Aside from being a nuisance and disruptive, tinnitus can cause frequent awakenings during the night, as the perceived sound becomes more noticeable in the quiet of the bedroom - disrupting the normal sleep cycle and causing insomnia and sleep deprivation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When such sounds last more than six months, it's known as chronic tinnitus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2024 study published in Frontiers in Pharmacology that analyzed a survey of 398 cases of Covid vaccination-related tinnitus found it occurred in 47 cases per million complete vaccinations with Pfizer's Covid shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were also 51 cases of tinnitus per million complete vaccinations with Moderna's shot and 70 cases per million complete vaccinations with J&amp;amp;J/Janssen's shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Hamid Djalilian, chief medical advisor for NeuroMed Tinnitus Clinic, told the Daily Mail the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) has about 12,000 reports of tinnitus following a Covid vaccination, 'but compared to the millions of vaccines given, the overall rate is low.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A team at Stanford Medicine Molecular Neurotology Laboratory is studying to find the underlying cause of tinnitus and identify people at risk of developing it after getting a vaccine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Konstantina Stankovic, an otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeon who is leading the research, told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/covid-vaccine-side-effects-tinnitus-may-linked-inflammation-rcna80675"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;: 'We think that many forms of tinnitus reflect some damage in the inner ear and then the brain tries to compensate for the damage and starts to make sound of its own.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research is ongoing and findings have not been published yet.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To treat tinnitus, doctors typically prescribe steroids and one case study also saw doctors treat a patient with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment, which is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that uses magnetic pulses to adjust brain activity that may be causing the ear ringing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Djalilian said 'the best thing is to start supportive care' if you develop the condition following a vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He continued: 'This includes antioxidants, hydration, and rest. Staying calm is important, as anxiety and stress only makes things worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kari Ponce de Leon, a 43-year-old mother-of-two from Montana, told the Daily Mail doctors diagnosed her with a series of blood conditions that caused her immune system to block platelets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Blood clots and low platelets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The co-occurrence of blood clots and low platelet counts following a Covid vaccination is a condition called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is a rare but serious condition that has been linked to the J&amp;amp;J/Janssen Covid vaccine, the CDC reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It involves the formation of blood clots (thrombosis) together with a decrease in platelet count (thrombocytopenia).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blood clots can travel throughout the body and lead to deadly complications like strokes, while platelets are essential for blood to clot and for wounds to heal, so having too few could lead to uncontrolled, deadly bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms include severe headaches, blurry vision, difficulty speaking, easy bruising, leg pain or swelling, excessive bleeding and abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A CDC report from August 2021 stated there had been 38 cases of TTS within 15 days of Covid vaccinations and four patients had died as of July 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, the overall TTS rate was three cases per 1million doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In early 2021, the FDA and CDC recommended pausing the use of the J&amp;amp;J/Janssen vaccine over concerns of its connection to TTS - with six cases having been reported up until that point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In April 2021, however, it lifted the pause after a safety review and the agencies stated the benefits outweighed potential risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More recent data on TTS after Covid vaccination is limited. One 2022 study found the rate was five cases per 130,000 people based on data from Norway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, researchers wrote, suggests an incidence of one case of TTS in 26,000 vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The precise mechanism by which Covid vaccines cause TTS is not known, but it is believed to be set off by some sort of immune response.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment for TTS includes anti-clotting medications and an infusion of blood that contains certain antibodies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kari Ponce de Leon, a 43-year-old mother-of-two from Montana, told the Daily Mail doctors diagnosed her with a series of blood conditions that caused her immune system to block platelets- similar to what happens with TTS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And one doctor wrote in a letter that her condition was likely caused by the Covid vaccine 'because he couldn't find any other reason.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A 2022 study led by academics at Imperial College London suggests almost 20million lives were saved by Covid vaccines in the first year since countries began rolling out the jabs, the majority in wealthy nations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Numbness or burning sensations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 2022 UK study found one of the most frequently reported adverse events after receiving the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was paresthesia - tingling, numbness, prickling or burning sensations throughout the body.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the 2023 preprint found 63 percent of people with PVS reported experiencing numbness and 63 also reported neuropathy - or nerve damage that causes pain, numbness, tingling or weakness most commonly in the arms, legs and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Numbness and burning sensations were also among the most common ailments suffered by PVS patients analyzed by the Yale researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eighty percent of people reported tingling and numbness and 58 percent reported burning sensations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment for these symptoms can include over-the-counter pain medications, anti-inflammatory creams, anti-anxiety and anti-convulsant medications used off-label, physical and occupational therapy and lifestyle and diet changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Guillain-Barré syndrome&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ross explained to the Daily Mail that Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a neurological disorder in which the body's immune system attacks and damages nerves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It causes muscle weakness, numbness, and paralysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said GBS is caused by antibodies that attack the nervous system and it typically occurs after a viral infection or a vaccine - such as the one for Covid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms include unsteady walking, trouble with facial movements and speaking and tingling and weakness most often in the feet, legs, arms and upper body. While most patients recover, severe cases can result in paralysis or death.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, recent studies have found evidence suggesting an increased risk of GBS among adults aged 18 and older due to the Covid vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the August 2021 CDC report, the agency said that after 12.6million doses of the &lt;span&gt;J&amp;amp;J/Janssen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; vaccine, there had been &lt;/span&gt;100 reports of GBS &lt;span&gt;between February and June of that year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the time, the rate of GBS was roughly eight cases per million &lt;span&gt;J&amp;amp;J/Janssen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; vaccine doses. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate study from 2023 published in The Cureus Journal of Medical Science found that Covid shots like the &lt;span&gt;J&amp;amp;J/Janssen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; vaccine - which is a type of vector vaccine - &lt;/span&gt;could make a person over twice as likely to develop GBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vector vaccines use a harmless virus to deliver genetic material into the body to trigger an immune response against the targeted disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers conducted a review of 70 studies on post-vaccination GBS and found 80 percent of the patients developed GBS within 21 days following the first dose of a vector vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Lees told this website that one meta-analysis estimated the overall incidence of GBS to be four per 1million doses of an adenovirus vector vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dr Lees, who is a medical writer at ZipHealth, said a Covid-19 infection itself is associated with an increased risk of developing GBS - 'higher than any potential risk associated with vaccination.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While scientists are yet to determine how the vaccine can trigger GBS, they noted that most of the affected patients were successfully treated and only one death was reported due to autonomic dysfunction - a condition where involuntary body functions such as heart rate, blood pressure and digestion do not function properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no direct cure for GBS and therapy concentrates on alleviating symptoms and preventing complications through blood transfusions, respiratory support and physical therapy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 04:09:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQNjlFM0N2OXN1bWdWakc4VGFXTjVZb0lYUWlkRWxObWQ4TUwwZkVQU1IwVWROR05VX3MtTXVLZmgyV3NyQkNzYUFGdGxuMFZpeUlGdEhoeHc1aklYSFMtNXB4VGhvUG5GVzRXVlk1SkRQSHVWdEw3M2lEX20xbXRwYnBXc1pHTnZaU1FEZ1BOaWM4NVdMdlduc1FLZw</guid></item><item><title>研究将大麻使用与痴呆风险增加联系起来- WKRC | Study links cannabis use to increased dementia risk - WKRC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowJBVV95cUxQN1NRZFRrYUhMRVE2M3kwbmNoa1BkVUN0bGZ5WFBVQWMxaE5CN1Q5N21ZcU04LU95M21mSG9kY3d1UFJvUjBRekJ3RHR5T21ickh6LVFYeXVWZXc2bXVQRng5MnZrd0IwdVprSWtIcTFHWC1aOE95QzVIU2h2MFFJWHlZaWFQbkNhMmc1ZERVYmgyWjBCREI0LWhnd25nNlFhRGtMbUVrcEdWR3YzczI1TlIxQTBEb3BSM2xqU0JuLXlCWU5rVG0zOElVWkN6R3ZnNVBIUmZuV3Z3ekw1cDUxS3RuaUp6LWpFMDNmMGs2alVCMWE1UWJuUE85c1hUR3RlNGhvMElMbDlmSHNtUjZvMTJNZkt6ejdzYW8yb2JiLUd6ZnM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="index-module_storyColumn__EZ7G" id="js-Story-Content-0"&gt;&lt;p class="StoryTags-module_tagWrapperLine__Jfav"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNDATED (WKRC/CNN Newsource) - As cannabis enthusiasts celebrated 420 Day, a new study has emerged linking regular cannabis use to an increased risk of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which examined more than 6 million Canadians, found that within five years of an emergency room visit or hospitalization related to cannabis, 5% of individuals were diagnosed with dementia.

Over 60 million people in the U.S. are affected by a digestive disease, and others may experience symptoms but go undiagnosed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Seeking help from a gastroenterologist can help you catch an issue before it worsens. Best case, it can give you peace of mind about a pesky digestive symptom you’ve been experiencing. We spoke with three gastroenterologists (GIs) to share eight signs that indicate you should see a gut doctor. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “While there are many causes of rectal bleeding, including benign conditions such as hemorrhoids, it is important to seek evaluation to rule out other dangerous, and potentially life-limiting conditions, such as colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease, amongst other potential diseases,” says &lt;a href="https://www.manhattangastroenterology.com/dr-michael-schopis/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Michael Schopis, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist at Manhattan Gastroenterology.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “This has become even more important with recent studies showing the increased incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer,” says Schopis. A 2024 study in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet Oncology&lt;/em&gt; found that early-onset colorectal cancer incidence rates are rising throughout the world, with the US being among the top.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Diarrhea for 2 weeks or longer should be evaluated by a gastroenterologist to rule out potentially harmful conditions including inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, thyroid disease, persistent infection, etc,” says Schopis. So keep an eye out for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/289945/diarrhea-what-to-eat-and-avoid/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;loose or watery stools&lt;/a&gt; that last a couple of weeks or more.

You Have Intense Abdominal Pain &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Abdominal pain is something that is tricky because it sometimes just feels like a stomach ache. However, the abdominal pain could be triggered by organs outside of your digestive system,” says &lt;a href="https://mdschool.tcu.edu/empathetic-scholar/communication/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;James Cox, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a GI physician, assistant professor of medicine &amp;amp; director of clinical skill development at Burnett School of Medicine at TCU.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;A stomachache here and there may be normal, but if it’s intense or persistent, it’s time to see a gastroenterologist. “Unresolving or debilitating abdominal pain can be a sign of something serious and, as such, should be seen by a gastroenterologist,” says Schopis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You Have Persistent Bloating &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “New evidence has shown that bloating can be an early sign of intestinal inflammation and, left untreated, can lead to other chronic health issues,” says &lt;a href="https://kennethbrownmd.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kenneth Brown, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a Texas-based gastroenterologist. It may signal an imbalance in your gut microbiome, which can lead to issues like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ibs-symptoms-8654975" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;irritable bowel syndrome&lt;/a&gt; (IBS) and metabolic diseases like diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “If you are experiencing consistent or recurrent abdominal bloating accompanied by other symptoms, it is crucial to seek medical assistance immediately,” says Brown. Some other symptoms you might notice are abdominal pain, changes in your bowel habits, unexplained weight loss or vomiting. While it may be benign, it’s worth checking with a gastroenterologist to see if it’s something more serious.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People gain or lose weight all the time, but if you’re losing weight and don’t understand why, it may be time to consult a GI doctor. “Weight loss will typically come as a loss of 10 pounds or more very suddenly without the person changing any of their exercise or eating habits,” says Cox. This could signal an underlying health issue that hinders nutrient absorption or lowers appetite. Some examples are &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/celiac-disease-and-sneaky-signs-you-might-have-it-8652999" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;celiac disease&lt;/a&gt; or inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Changes in the color, consistency or shape of your stools might be a sign that it’s time to see a gastroenterologist. “A change in bowel habits is a sign that people will notice if they look at their stool and see differences in color and consistency or notice a stark change in how often they are having bowel movements,” says Cox. If this is you, schedule a visit with your doctor to see if there’s an underlying reason for these changes.

You Have Recurring Heartburn &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Chronic heartburn can be tricky because sometimes it might seem like indigestion and people won’t pay much attention to it. But if you’re feeling a burning pain in your chest near your sternum, this is a telltale sign that it is heartburn and not just indigestion,” says Cox. It might be a sign of a hiatal hernia or gastroesophageal &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-acid-reflux-8760717" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reflux disease&lt;/a&gt; (GERD), so see a doctor for a thorough evaluation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

You Have Swallowing Difficulties &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Trouble swallowing can come in a few forms, such as food coming up in the throat or if food feels as if it’s stuck in your throat or chest,” says Cox. Persistent pain with swallowing is another thing to look out for. According to Schopis, your doctor might schedule an endoscopy so they can evaluate your gastrointestinal tract with a camera.

Other symptoms that warrant a doctor’s visit, according to Schopis, include persistent nausea or vomiting, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7676216/sneaky-signs-you-could-have-iron-deficiency/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;iron deficiency&lt;/a&gt; anemia or black or bloody stools. Your doctor can do further testing to see if your symptoms are a sign of an underlying health issue. “Many conditions are readily treatable if diagnosed early,” says Cox. So it’s worth seeing your doctor proactively to prevent the issue from progressing.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While it can be tempting to minimize digestive issues, it's better to be safe than sorry. A gastroenterologist can provide a thorough evaluation to ensure there isn’t something more serious going on. So if you experience symptoms like rectal bleeding, persistent diarrhea, bloating or heartburn or intense abdominal pain, to name a few, it’s time to see a gastroenterologist. While these symptoms may be benign, it’s best to see a GI doctor so that if there is something wrong, you can catch it early.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But according to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthcaresystem/datasets/experiencesofnhshealthcareservicesinengland" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;ONS Health Insight Survey&lt;/a&gt; from February, commissioned by NHS England, 45.8% of women compared to just 33.5% of men had attempted to make contact with their GP practice for themselves or someone else in their household in the last 28 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Men were more likely to say they weren't registered at a dental practice and "rarely or never" used a pharmacy, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They also make up &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/hospital-outpatient-activity/2023-24" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;considerably fewer hospital outpatient appointments&lt;/a&gt; than women, even when pregnancy-related appointments are discounted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Men are "less likely to attend routine appointments and more likely to delay help-seeking until symptoms interfere with daily function," says Paul Galdas, professor of men's health at the University of York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This all &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clywrl5460jo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;affects men's health outcomes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Experts say there's a long list of reasons why men might put off seeking medical help, and new survey data from the NHS suggests that concerns about how they are perceived come into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In the survey, 48% of male respondents agreed they felt a degree of pressure to "tough it out" when it came to potential health issues, while a third agreed they felt talking about potential health concerns might make others see them as weak. The poll heard from almost 1,000 men in England in November and December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Society associates masculinity with traits like self-reliance, independence and not showing vulnerability, says social psychologist Prof Brendan Gough of Leeds Beckett University. "Men are traditionally supposed to sort things out themselves".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It's worrying to see just how many men still feel unable to talk about their health concerns," says Dr Claire Fuller, NHS medical director for primary care. She notes that men can be reluctant to seek medical support for mental health and for changes in their bodies that could be signs of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"GPs are often the best way to access the help they need," she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-737179d2-0 erjHHi"&gt;'Men are inherent problem-solvers'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Kevin McMullan says he's learned from working for men's mental health charity ManHealth that men want to solve their own problems. He says he struggled with his mental health for years before he finally got help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"You want to fix it yourself. Men are inherent problem-solvers and how you are feeling is a problem in the same way that having a flat tyre is a problem," says Kevin, 44, from Sedgefield in County Durham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This is something that the Health Insights Survey indicates, too. The data suggests that when people were unable to contact their GP practice, men were significantly more likely than women to report "self-managing" their condition, while women were more likely than men to go to a pharmacy or call 111.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Many men feel that help-seeking threatens their sense of independence or competence," Prof Galdas says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250409-091508-0ef9b7676-web-2.19.1-12/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7bda/live/f2655970-1cfc-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7bda/live/f2655970-1cfc-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7bda/live/f2655970-1cfc-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7bda/live/f2655970-1cfc-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7bda/live/f2655970-1cfc-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7bda/live/f2655970-1cfc-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7bda/live/f2655970-1cfc-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7bda/live/f2655970-1cfc-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Kevin McMullan A man in a black t-shirt in front of a plain background smiles at the camera" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Kevin McMullan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Kevin McMullan says many men try solve their own mental health problems&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof Galdas points to other factors deterring men from going to the doctors, like appointment systems that don't fit around their working patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Services also rely on talking openly about problems, he suggests, which doesn't reflect how men speak about health concerns - and there are no fixed check-ups targeting younger men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Women, in contrast, are "sort of forced to engage in the health system" because they might seek appointments related to menstruation, contraception, cervical screenings or pregnancy, says Seb Pillon, a GP in Bolton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;And they're largely in control of organising their family's healthcare, too. For example, roughly 90% of the people who contacted the children's sleep charity Sleep Action for help in the last six months were mums, grandmothers and other women in the children's lives, its head of service Alyson O'Brien says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Because women are more integrated in the healthcare system - through seeking support for both themselves and their children - they're more health-literate and are often the driving force behind their partners seeking medical help, according to Prof Galdas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;And men just have a different attitude towards healthcare, Dr Pillon says. He believes many see it solely as treatment - solving their problems - rather than preventative. Men are, for example, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bowel-cancer-screening-annual-report-2023-to-2024/bowel-cancer-screening-standards-data-report-2023-24#bcsp-s02-uptake" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;less likely&lt;/a&gt; to take part in the NHS's bowel cancer screening programme.

With few symptoms apart for a test it can be a ticking timebomb, increasing risks of heart disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; figures showing almost two in three people (59%) have raised levels. This means it is an issue many need to tackle to remain healthy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Cholesterol is a type of blood fat which is made in the liver. It’s found in some foods too. &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Cholesterol charity Heart UK&lt;/a&gt; says: "We all need some cholesterol in our bodies just to keep us ticking over, but having too much can clog up your arteries and lead to health problems in the future, including heart disease. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"By getting a simple cholesterol test and making healthy lifestyle changes, most people can keep their cholesterol levels healthy." The charity says there is one change which can reduce cholesterol levels by up to 10% in just three weeks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/healthy-living/flora-proactiv-2" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;advises foods with added sterols and stanols&lt;/a&gt; are thought by some to be the "most effective single food for lowering cholesterol". It explains both are plant chemicals which are a similar size and shape to cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It says: "They are absorbed from the intestines into the blood stream and block some cholesterol from being absorbed, lowering the cholesterol in your blood. We get a small amount of sterols from plant-based foods such as vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, whole grains, fruits and vegetables, but it’s not enough to lower cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"So, food companies have developed foods with plant sterols or stanols added to them, such as mini yogurt drinks, fat spreads, milk and yogurts. These fortified foods lower your cholesterol gradually, over a few weeks, and how much depends on the amount you eat. Some experts believe they are the most effective single food for lowering cholesterol."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;b&gt;Can everyone eat food with added sterols and stanols?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Heart UK says most people can however they will not give any benefit to some. And it issued a warning as while the majority can safely eat these fortified foods they are not suitable for some people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who can eat foods with added?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;People with high cholesterol – there’s no real benefit if you don’t have high cholesterol&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Children with inherited high cholesterol such as familial hypercholesterolaemia – with support from a doctor or dietitian&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;People taking statins – sterols and stanols will help to lower your cholesterol further because they work in a different way to the statin&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;They are not suitable for:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Women who are pregnant or breast feeding&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Children who do not have an inherited condition&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;They won’t have much effect if you are taking Ezetrol (Ezetimibe) because they both work in a similar way&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;b&gt;How much do I need?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Heart UK you should aim for one to three servings of fortified foods a day. This will give you 1.5 to 3g of stanols and sterols.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It adds: "Over three weeks, this could lower your cholesterol by up to 10%. There’s no extra benefit to having more than 3g a day."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can get enough sterols and stanols for the whole day with either:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;three servings (2tsp) of fat spread&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;or 1 yoghurt (115g)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;or one fortified yoghurt mini-drink (65-100g bottle), which can be a dairy product or dairy-free.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;It advises: "To get the most from these foods, eat some every day and eat them with a meal rather than on their own. Look out for products labelled ‘fortified with stanols or sterols’. They can be branded, such as the Flora ProActiv and Benecol ranges, as well as supermarket own products."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNang5bV82ZU1YSkRfQXlBZS14Sy16TFA3OVl0djNNbWZnV1o3SVF5d3YwM19GQWZEdGNDUF8zcko5NnBiUHZPWF96TEJlSDc5Y0tISUI1TWQwRU5lYjJtWGRPNUhlS1BYdW4wWjhtRU9lLTFNM3MzbW5xbEsySU5hdGZMakw4WTE3</guid></item><item><title>结肠癌正在上升：这种维生素缺乏可能是原因-时尚 | Colon Cancer Is On the Rise: This Vitamin Deficiency May Be Why - Vogue</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE5RX1hKM2tOMmhsUHdqV3haTEw0X0RENUFoc3kyN1BzblJnbWt1Q1dna0lBRVlSZzJmdEVMVUVoOHFKVWdoRmdnSG40cXYxOVBHQjJhbU9zWXBJdkw1TkM0TktjMTZyWjZsSnh5cQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anybody under 55, listen up—there has been &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.facs.org/for-medical-professionals/news-publications/news-and-articles/bulletin/2024/november-december-2024-volume-109-issue-10/clinicians-struggle-to-understand-dramatic-rise-in-early-onset-colorectal-cancer/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.facs.org/for-medical-professionals/news-publications/news-and-articles/bulletin/2024/november-december-2024-volume-109-issue-10/clinicians-struggle-to-understand-dramatic-rise-in-early-onset-colorectal-cancer/"}' href="https://www.facs.org/for-medical-professionals/news-publications/news-and-articles/bulletin/2024/november-december-2024-volume-109-issue-10/clinicians-struggle-to-understand-dramatic-rise-in-early-onset-colorectal-cancer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a dramatic increase&lt;/a&gt; in the likelihood you or somebody you know will be diagnosed with colon cancer in early adulthood or middle age. And while the exact &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; is currently under investigation, there is one interesting finding related to your blood levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We're finding that people diagnosed with colon cancer have &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/vitamin-d-deficiency" target="_blank"&gt;low vitamin D levels&lt;/a&gt;,” says vice president of in-office care at One Medical &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.hlth.com/2023event/speakers/natasha-bhuyan-md" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.hlth.com/2023event/speakers/natasha-bhuyan-md"}' href="https://www.hlth.com/2023event/speakers/natasha-bhuyan-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Natasha Bhuyan&lt;/a&gt;, MD. And while the correlation is still a bit chicken-or-the-egg (“this discovery is in the really, really early stages,” Bhuyan adds), there's something else to note: results from a couple of studies &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9537583/" target="_blank"&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4229786/" target="_blank"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, which reveal a “deficiency of vitamin D increases the incidence of colon cancer and also has a negative impact on the survival of colon cancer patients,” it might be time to ask to have your levels looked at the next time you're at the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a blood test will officially reveal if you're deficient. But with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4018438/" target="_blank"&gt;research showing&lt;/a&gt; that almost a billion people on the planet are deficient in vitamin D, it's worth asking your doctor for a test next time you're getting a physical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/vitamin-d-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; plays an important role in both our physical and mental health, helping build strong bones, keep the immune system strong, and balance mental health. Bhuyan advises that there are actually a variety of ways to keep your vitamin D levels healthy. “Some people will eat &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/meals-rich-in-vitamin-d-and-magnesium" target="_blank"&gt;a vitamin-D-rich diet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/how-to-get-vitamin-d" target="_blank"&gt;fortified foods&lt;/a&gt;,” she says. “There's also the option of taking a &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/vitamin-d-benefits-winter" target="_blank"&gt;vitamin D supplement&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/serotonin-vitamin-d-sun" target="_blank"&gt;spending time in the sun&lt;/a&gt; because that helps your body make it naturally. But we always advise you to be really cautious about spending time in the sun, because it can also increase your risk of skin cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while the new diagnosis statistics are startling (“diagnoses of people under 55 years of age doubled from 11% (1 in 10) in 1995 to 20% (1 in 5) in 2019,” reads a press release from the &lt;a href="https://pressroom.cancer.org/CRCFactsFigures2023" target="_blank"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;) for Gen Z, Millennials, and Generation X, knowledge can truly be power in this instance. And maybe eating more vitamin D can be, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 23:31:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE5RX1hKM2tOMmhsUHdqV3haTEw0X0RENUFoc3kyN1BzblJnbWt1Q1dna0lBRVlSZzJmdEVMVUVoOHFKVWdoRmdnSG40cXYxOVBHQjJhbU9zWXBJdkw1TkM0TktjMTZyWjZsSnh5cQ</guid></item><item><title>“运动型”女性在腰痛被误诊为坐骨神经痛后死亡-独立报 | ‘Athletic’ woman dies after lower back pain was misdiagnosed as sciatica - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixwFBVV95cUxOazhCc0xBUU9ibFJXcXRQNmZ6bmRiVnJycHRmTTh4WDY3RDAza2dUenJVaHpJUWttWElRZWJFeVBFY0dSMkFvT3l6cXR4SWw0bUN5YUVabkF1d0V5Z0JWZGotV053NjhwX2FVUnM5OUh4eDZmVkNYVnVzRGllMHZOR0JCWU1XUno1NTBBUnh3ZXlpbU5QbVVXX3l6ZFNzdkFKNmprclN3TlVyX2ZHZENhVWlFOFFTeFM1U2VwMERFQVdHSkZJaGlN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 eWQiqu sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 cGmNxG"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 iqSitv"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 dlmCG"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 igdyzJ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cPkZJS"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 fGzMFb sc-hez36s-16 fJelbS"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 fiXggt"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 eSVQSf"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 cDGSNR"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 kxbAkl"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 kGYWZt"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

was initially misdiagnosed, died from &lt;a href="/topic/bone-cancer"&gt;bone cancer&lt;/a&gt; less than a year after a tumour was finally discovered in her pelvis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Kate Drummond started experiencing back pain in 2020, she initially believed it was due to “poor posture” or excessive exercise, according to her 33-year-old sister, Kelly Drummond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the pain spread to her hip in May 2021, she visited the A&amp;amp;E department of her local hospital in &lt;a href="/topic/devon"&gt;Devon&lt;/a&gt; and was diagnosed with "probable sciatica”, and Kelly said it was noted she was “one of the youngest patients (doctors) had ever seen” with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After going on to seek an MRI scan through private care, Kate was given the “life-altering” news that she had a “grapefruit-sized” tumour in her pelvis in August 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She underwent treatment for several months but deteriorated “rapidly” in January 2022 as the cancer aggressively spread to her lungs, liver, and other bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kate died in March 2022, less than a year after the initial tumour discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her sister Kelly is sharing her story for the first time to urge others to “listen to your body” and “advocate for yourself”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="6" class="sc-482ou5-0 iZkYUL"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/04/20/8/44/PA-Real-Life-Sarcoma-2.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/04/20/8/44/PA-Real-Life-Sarcoma-2.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;crop=3%3A2%2Csmart&amp;amp;trim=61%2C0%2C61%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/04/20/8/44/PA-Real-Life-Sarcoma-2.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;crop=3%3A2%2Csmart&amp;amp;trim=61%2C0%2C61%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Kelly (left) described Kate (right) as a 'fit and healthy' individual" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-20006"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;Kelly (left) described Kate (right) as a 'fit and healthy' individual&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt;

pandemic, and she thought this was due to poor posture or a slightly uncomfortable working set-up,” Kelly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By January 2021, the pain was more persistent and she had some new pain radiating into her hip as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="6" class="sc-482ou5-0 jjunLz"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/04/20/8/59/PA-Real-Life-Sarcoma-3.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/04/20/8/59/PA-Real-Life-Sarcoma-3.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;crop=3%3A2%2Csmart&amp;amp;trim=291%2C0%2C349%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/04/20/8/59/PA-Real-Life-Sarcoma-3.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;crop=3%3A2%2Csmart&amp;amp;trim=291%2C0%2C349%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Kate was given emergency radiotherapy and started chemotherapy treatment" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-20007"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;Kate was given emergency radiotherapy and started chemotherapy treatment&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt;

That means everyone in Wisconsin needs to check for blacklegged ticks (also known as deer ticks), lone star ticks, and wood ticks (also known as American dog ticks) for over half the year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The return of ticks means the return of the threat of tick-borne diseases, so protecting yourself from tick bites is important. Lyme disease, a potentially serious bacterial infection caused by the bite of an infected deer tick, is the most common tick-borne disease in &lt;a href="https://b105country.com/tags/wisconsin/" target="_blank"&gt;Wisconsin,&lt;/a&gt; but there's another threat that has been on the rise, and it can pose an even bigger health risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cases Of Deadly Powassan Virus Rising Into 2025&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Lyme disease, &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/powassan-virus#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20symptoms%20of,have%20long%2Dterm%20health%20problems." target="_blank"&gt;Powassan virus&lt;/a&gt; is spread by the blacklegged tick (deer tick), as well as by groundhog ticks and squirrel ticks, but these latter two rarely bite humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, while Lyme disease can usually be treated with antibiotics, the Powassan virus disease has no specific treatment or vaccine available, and while thankfully still rare, about 10% of people with severe Powassan virus disease die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, about half of survivors will experience long-term neurological problems, including memory problems, recurring headaches, and loss of muscle mass and strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first case of the Powassan virus in Wisconsin &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/tick/powassan-about.htm" target="_blank"&gt;was identified&lt;/a&gt; in 2003. Since then,  Wisconsin has&lt;a href="http://Wisconsin%20has%20seen%20a%20total%20of%2055%20probable%20and%20confirmed%20cases%20since%202003." target="_blank"&gt; reportedly&lt;/a&gt; seen a total of 55 probable and confirmed cases, with most of the cases having been in northern Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, cases of the virus are still very rare, but because of the severe health threat it can pose to those infected, it's important to do everything you can to prevent tick bites and to know the symptoms of the Powassan virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Powassan Virus Incubation Period And Symptoms&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incubation period (time between tick bite and symptom onset) is typically 1 to 4 weeks. Initially, many people may show no symptoms or only mild symptoms, but the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/about/index.html#:~:text=Initial%20symptoms%20can%20include%20fever,and%20spinal%20cord%20(meningitis)." target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; says that once symptoms arrive, they could include fever, headache, vomiting, weakness, confusion, loss of coordination, speech difficulties, and seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Severe cases of Powassan virus can lead to Powassan &lt;a class="DTlJ6d" href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1116US1118&amp;amp;cs=1&amp;amp;sca_esv=fb769e0fcd5d8652&amp;amp;sxsrf=AHTn8zolmhoTn5Z-shgYjtIyZbxOWuvu_g%3A1744136052899&amp;amp;q=encephalitis&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiF5JmOhcmMAxU_rokEHcn0EecQxccNegQIJxAB&amp;amp;mstk=AUtExfAjAeigo7JcT7enlbnsYD6LocosF7osv88FkXHb5wTSLnUD8Z2u63VKLH6WFCro1sqGk__pMLtXZp4gEWNDm11oB9u3E2E-YLIo1chFlKfcKIW1TT-45eq9yPqjnyViahonhB_PX1XdROrLA87KfSFwJ1VADn2sXwCs7cy4eTA038EOTnr37PEtZ_QZsx5TRW66kYTDUR_wOfiS2Ye5b-CPf3bdg9Ry3_9Odt2PPOf1RMB0HJYcUK4GBHJ12RuhB0v0Q9HumRgXy08Su3k3wF6l&amp;amp;csui=3" target="_blank" data-hveid="CCcQAQ"&gt;encephalitis&lt;/a&gt; (inflammation of the brain) or &lt;a class="DTlJ6d" href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1116US1118&amp;amp;cs=1&amp;amp;sca_esv=fb769e0fcd5d8652&amp;amp;sxsrf=AHTn8zolmhoTn5Z-shgYjtIyZbxOWuvu_g%3A1744136052899&amp;amp;q=meningitis&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiF5JmOhcmMAxU_rokEHcn0EecQxccNegQIJxAC&amp;amp;mstk=AUtExfAjAeigo7JcT7enlbnsYD6LocosF7osv88FkXHb5wTSLnUD8Z2u63VKLH6WFCro1sqGk__pMLtXZp4gEWNDm11oB9u3E2E-YLIo1chFlKfcKIW1TT-45eq9yPqjnyViahonhB_PX1XdROrLA87KfSFwJ1VADn2sXwCs7cy4eTA038EOTnr37PEtZ_QZsx5TRW66kYTDUR_wOfiS2Ye5b-CPf3bdg9Ry3_9Odt2PPOf1RMB0HJYcUK4GBHJ12RuhB0v0Q9HumRgXy08Su3k3wF6l&amp;amp;csui=3" target="_blank" data-hveid="CCcQAg"&gt;meningitis&lt;/a&gt; (inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord), which can lead to neurological damage and, in some cases, death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you suspect you have Powassan virus symptoms, seek immediate medical attention, as early diagnosis and supportive care are crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Preventing Tick Bites&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important thing you can do is take steps to protect yourself from tick bites. A key is knowing where deer ticks are most likely to be found. &lt;a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/tickborne/prevention.html" target="_blank"&gt;Health officials say&lt;/a&gt; that disease-spreading deer ticks are found in wooded or brushy areas, while American dog ticks (wood ticks) are found in grassy, more open habitats and woods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're going to be outside in these areas, cover exposed skin by wearing long sleeves, long pants, and tall socks. Wearing light colored clothing also makes ticks easier to spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/tick/bite-prevention.htm#:~:text=Tuck%20shirts%20into%20pants%2C%20and,ticks%20still%20on%20your%20clothing." target="_blank"&gt; Wisconsin Department of Health Services &lt;/a&gt;says you should be using a tick repellent that contains one of these:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;20–30%  DEET. Do not use DEET for infants under two months of age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10–20% Picaridin. Products containing permethrin, used on clothing and gear, are especially recommended for people who spend a lot of time in wooded areas. However, never use permethrin on your skin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;15–20% IR3535&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30–40% oil of lemon eucalyptus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also create tick-safe zones by doing the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clear tall grass, brush, and leaf litter from the yard or trails.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use wood chips or gravel as a barrier between lawns and wooded areas. Use it around patios and play equipment. The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) recommends a three-foot-wide barrier to prevent ticks from entering recreational areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mow your lawn often. Remove cut grass and leaves.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep tables, swing sets, and other play equipment away from woods, shrubs, and tall grass. Place in a sunny location, if possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t feed deer. They often carry ticks into the yard. Build barriers to keep deer from coming into the yard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remove woodpiles. If you must stack wood, place it neatly in dry areas away from houses. This will lower the number of rodents in the area. Rodents can bring ticks into the yard. Rodents also spread disease to ticks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Check For Ticks Frequently&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say you should be checking for ticks at least once a day, but ticks can spread the Powassan virus a lot faster than Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important things to keep in mind:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ticks must remain attached for one to two days before they can transmit the Lyme disease bacteria. However, the ticks can transmit the Powassan virus in as little as 15 minutes after attachment to a person.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bathe or shower after coming indoors to wash off and more easily find ticks that may be crawling on or attached to you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Search your entire body closely, especially hard-to-see areas (behind knees, groin area, and armpits).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ticks may look like a speck of dirt or a freckle on skin, so use a family member or a mirror to help you find them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you find a tick on yourself, remove the tick as soon as possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Safely Removing Ticks Found On Your Body&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do find a tick on yourself or a loved one, removing it as quickly as possible is very important, as it lowers your risk of tick-borne disease transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use a pair of tweezers or your fingers to grasp the tick by the head, close to the skin. Pull the tick outward slowly, gently, and steadily.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clean the area with soap and water.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health officials warn against avoiding 'folk remedies' like Vaseline®, nail polish remover, or burning matches because they are not a safe or effective way to remove ticks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class="photogallery-wrapper blog-photogallery "&gt;&lt;h2 class="photogallery-title"&gt;Items That Are Banned From The Trash In Wisconsin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="photogallery-credit"&gt;Gallery Credit: Lauren Wells&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="photogallery-wrapper blog-photogallery "&gt;&lt;h2 class="photogallery-title"&gt;Exotic Animals Legal To Own In Wisconsin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="photogallery-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wisconsin is one of the few states in the US without strict laws against exotic animals.

&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to be a pet parent to know that dogs and cats are like night and day. The history of dogs, at least in their current form, traces back around 15,000 years. According to current scientific consensus, toward the end of the Last Ice Age, more submissive individuals within the gray wolf population began adapting to human interaction in ways they hadn’t before. Many of the friendly traits these proto-dogs developed are still with us, only now, they’re genetically wired to &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scotttravers/2024/03/29/dogs-understand-our-words-more-than-they-let-on-science-reveals/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/scotttravers/2024/03/29/dogs-understand-our-words-more-than-they-let-on-science-reveals/" target="_self" aria-label="read and respond to us"&gt;read and respond to us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike dogs, cats appear to have “domesticated themselves,” choosing to live alongside humans while maintaining their independence, a process that began 9,000 years ago. That might sound on-brand for cat meme material, but the science backs it up. Housecat DNA remains largely unchanged from their wild ancestors, and history has shown that these furballs are never too far from &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scotttravers/2024/07/14/a-house-cat-was-brought-to-a-remote-island-in-1894-a-year-later-a-species-was-extinct/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/scotttravers/2024/07/14/a-house-cat-was-brought-to-a-remote-island-in-1894-a-year-later-a-species-was-extinct/" target="_self" aria-label="flipping back into elite predator mode when the right opportunity strikes"&gt;flipping back into elite predator mode when the right opportunity strikes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this context makes the story of France’s 1960s feline space mission even heavier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In The ’60s, Cats Were ‘Chosen’ From The Streets Of Paris For A Secret Space Mission&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1947, the United States made &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scotttravers/2025/04/19/3-animals-you-didnt-know-went-to-space---one-might-still-be-out-there-waiting-to-wake-up/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/scotttravers/2025/04/19/3-animals-you-didnt-know-went-to-space---one-might-still-be-out-there-waiting-to-wake-up/" target="_self" aria-label="space history with a swarm of fruit flies"&gt;space history with a swarm of fruit flies&lt;/a&gt;. Launched aboard a captured German rocket, these unusual passengers were sent to study the effects of cosmic radiation on living organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Cold War escalated, space became the stage for geopolitical flexing. The U.S. and the U.S.S.R were aiming for more than just technological milestones. It was a brazen display of ideological one-upmanship. In 1957, the Soviets launched Laika into space, and by the early ’60s, animals had become central to space programs around the world, their lives traded for data in the race beyond Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the backdrop in which France — late to the party but eager to join the club — made a curious choice. While the Soviets sent dogs and the Americans trained primates, France turned to stray cats, plucked from the streets of Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourteen female cats were brought in by scientists at CERMA, France’s space medicine program. None of them were named. In fact, in a small attempt to keep things clinical, they were deliberately given ID numbers instead of names. It was treated as pre-launch protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cats were wired up with electrodes to monitor brain activity and put through a bootcamp of sorts. They were confined in tight containers for long periods, just to observe their reactions. Then came the centrifuge — designed to simulate the crushing G-forces of launch and re-entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For animals that had once stalked alleyways and rooftops, it was an abrupt shift in lifestyle. Eventually, six cats made it to the final round. One of them, a black-and-white tuxedo with the designation C341, stood out. Not because she was stronger, faster or more willing, but because she was the one who got chosen.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An unnamed stray, strapped into a capsule, headed for a once-in-a-lifetime journey past the Kármán line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;C341’s Launch Day In The Algerian Sahara, October 18, 1963&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A slender Veronique AGI rocket stood poised at the Interarmy Special Vehicles Test Centre in the Algerian Sahara. There was no towering launch tower. Instead, there were four long legs holding it upright. Inside the capsule sat C341 — still unnamed, still wired up and still unaware she was a participant in a geopolitical power struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rocket lifted off just after 8 a.m. and carried her beyond the bureaucratic boundary of space, the Kármán line. She hit &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-missions/felicette-first-cat-space" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-missions/felicette-first-cat-space" aria-label="9.5 g on the way up"&gt;9.5 g on the way up&lt;/a&gt;, spent a few minutes in weightlessness, then came back down under 7 g, sealed inside a capsule with no windows and no context. It lasted 13 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She flew 57 kilometers past the accepted edge of space, and minutes later, she landed upside down in the sand. When the press got hold of the story and assumed the space cat was male, they called her Félix. The scientists corrected them — Félicette. And with that, C341 finally had a name. However, it would take decades for anyone to remember it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-base embedly-align"&gt;&lt;fbs-embedly iframe-src="https://embedly.forbes.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fv-tpmvGRoyw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dv-tpmvGRoyw&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fv-tpmvGRoyw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube"&gt;&lt;/fbs-embedly&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Autopsy That Taught No One Anything&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Félicette didn’t get a reunion tour or a retirement cushion. Just a few weeks after her return, she was euthanized so scientists at CERMA could study her body. The goal was to see how spaceflight had affected her internal systems. But the results were underwhelming. Whatever they were hoping to find, they didn’t. The postmortem taught them little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, she was cataloged like any other lab subject. One experiment in a series. The only cat ever sent to space, and yet, for years, barely a footnote in history. That would change. But not for a while, and not in the &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scotttravers/2025/01/11/the-tragic-story-of-laika-the-soviet-canine-cosmonaut-who-made-space-history-in-1957/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/scotttravers/2025/01/11/the-tragic-story-of-laika-the-soviet-canine-cosmonaut-who-made-space-history-in-1957/" target="_self" aria-label="same way we remember Laika"&gt;same way we remember Laika&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Félicette Was Remembered Again, But Only Sort Of&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Félicette’s story was rediscovered in an era that had grown more reflective about the costs of our ambitions, particularly on non-consenting, non-human participants. In 2019, a statue was unveiled in her honor at the International Space University in Strasbourg. Cast in bronze, it showed her sitting atop Earth, looking up at the stars she once flew so close to. This gesture was the best we could come up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it’s only human to romanticize her, part of what makes her story so tragic is how unromantic it is. No one claimed she volunteered. She was a street cat who ended up strapped into a rocket. And yet, something about her legacy painfully lingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be because cats, despite all their independence, have evolved to understand us in subtle, unsettling ways. They respond to human emotion. They know how to earn food, how to navigate social cues and how to win affection without losing autonomy. Evolution, it seems, didn’t overwrite their instincts, it just &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1410083111" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1410083111" aria-label="rewired how they manage risk and reward in human environments"&gt;rewired how they manage risk and reward in human environments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that sense, Félicette was the perfect subject: independent enough to survive the streets of Paris, adaptable enough to tolerate confinement and familiar enough for her absence to finally sting — just a few decades too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While Félicette’s story is a slow burn, the cost of human progess has turned into a display of the snowball effect in action.

&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tablespoon of apple cider vinegar daily helped young participants lose weight in a 12-week study, but health experts advise caution before trying this approach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5"&gt;The kitchen ingredient with weight loss potential&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;A new study has uncovered surprising evidence that a common pantry staple might help with weight management goals. Research published in BMJ Nutrition, Prevention, &amp;amp; Health reveals that consuming apple cider vinegar daily may lead to significant weight reduction in adolescents and young adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;The 12-week study conducted with Lebanese participants aged 12 to 25 showed remarkable results. Those who consumed one tablespoon (15 milliliters) of apple cider vinegar daily lost an average of 15 pounds from their starting weight. Beyond weight reduction, participants experienced additional health improvements including lower blood sugar levels, reduced cholesterol, and decreased overall body fat measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;This research breaks new ground as previous studies had primarily examined vinegar’s weight loss effects in older adult populations. The findings represent a potential breakthrough in identifying accessible, non-pharmaceutical approaches to address rising obesity rates among younger generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5"&gt;How the 3-month vinegar experiment worked&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;The study involved 120 participants between ages 12 and 25, with an average starting weight of approximately 173 pounds. Researchers divided participants into different groups, each consuming varying amounts of apple cider vinegar daily for 12 consecutive weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;The results showed a clear dose-response relationship. The group consuming 15 milliliters (approximately one tablespoon) daily experienced the most dramatic weight loss, ending with an average weight of 155 pounds – an 18-pound reduction from baseline. Participants taking 10 milliliters daily finished at an average of 159 pounds, while those consuming just 5 milliliters reached an average of 163 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Beyond weight on the scale, all three vinegar-consuming groups showed meaningful decreases in waist circumference, hip measurements, and &lt;a href="https://rollingout.com/2025/01/25/bmi-measurements-full-health-picture/"&gt;BMI&lt;/a&gt; calculations. These anthropometric improvements suggest that the weight loss included reductions in body fat rather than just water weight or muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5"&gt;The science behind vinegar’s weight loss effects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Several mechanisms may explain how apple cider vinegar contributes to weight reduction. The acetic acid in vinegar appears to influence how the body processes carbohydrates and fats in several ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;First, vinegar consumption may slow gastric emptying – the rate at which food leaves your stomach and enters the small intestine. This delayed emptying helps people feel fuller longer after meals, potentially reducing overall calorie intake throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Second, research suggests acetic acid may activate certain enzyme pathways that increase fat burning and reduce fat storage in the body. These metabolic changes could help explain the reduction in overall body fat percentage observed in study participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Third, apple cider vinegar appears to improve insulin sensitivity, helping cells respond more effectively to insulin and better regulate blood sugar levels. This improved glucose control may reduce fat storage and help prevent the blood sugar spikes and crashes that often lead to unhealthy snacking behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5"&gt;Medical experts urge caution despite promising results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Health professionals reviewing the study findings advise approaching these results with measured optimism. Several factors warrant consideration before adopting a daily vinegar regimen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;The 12-week study duration, while informative, may not be sufficient to determine long-term sustainability or effects. &lt;a href="https://rollingout.com/2025/04/09/water-workouts-work-for-weight-loss/"&gt;Weight loss&lt;/a&gt; interventions often show promising initial results that become more difficult to maintain over extended periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Cultural and lifestyle differences between Lebanese teenagers and those in other countries could significantly impact outcomes. The typical Lebanese diet, physical activity patterns, and other lifestyle factors may interact with vinegar consumption in ways that might not translate to other populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Additionally, the study does not address whether participants maintained their weight loss after the 12-week intervention ended. Weight management research consistently shows that maintaining weight loss presents a greater challenge than achieving initial reductions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5"&gt;Potential downsides of daily vinegar consumption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;While apple cider vinegar offers potential benefits, regular consumption comes with several health considerations that shouldn’t be overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Dental health concerns rank high among potential risks. The high acidity of vinegar can erode tooth enamel with regular exposure, potentially leading to increased sensitivity and decay. Diluting vinegar with water and drinking through a straw may help minimize dental exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Digestive system disruption represents another common side effect. The acidity can irritate the esophagus and stomach lining in some individuals, potentially worsening conditions like acid reflux or gastritis. Those with sensitive digestive systems might experience heartburn, nausea, or stomach discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Medication interactions present perhaps the most serious consideration. Apple cider vinegar can interfere with certain medications, including insulin, diuretics, and some heart medications. The acidity may affect how these drugs are absorbed or metabolized in the body, potentially reducing their effectiveness or increasing side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Finally, rapid weight loss itself requires careful monitoring, especially in teenagers who are still developing. Any weight management approach for adolescents should ideally occur under medical supervision to ensure proper nutrition and healthy development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5"&gt;Safer approaches to weight management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;While the vinegar research shows promise, nutritionists and healthcare providers emphasize that proven weight management principles remain the foundation for healthy, sustainable results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Creating a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8017325/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;modest calorie deficit&lt;/a&gt; through a combination of dietary changes and increased physical activity continues to be the most reliable approach to weight management. Focusing on nutrient-dense whole foods while moderating highly processed options naturally reduces calorie intake while supporting overall health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Regular physical activity offers benefits beyond calorie burning. Exercise improves insulin sensitivity, builds metabolism-boosting muscle tissue, and enhances mood and sleep quality – all factors that support healthy weight management. Experts recommend finding enjoyable activities that can be maintained consistently rather than extreme regimens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;Behavioral strategies like mindful eating, adequate sleep, and stress management play crucial roles in successful weight management. These approaches address the psychological aspects of eating behavior that often undermine even the most carefully planned diet and exercise programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;For those interested in trying apple cider vinegar, health professionals suggest starting with small amounts (1-2 teaspoons) diluted in water, consuming it before meals, and monitoring for any adverse effects. This cautious approach allows individuals to assess tolerance while potentially gaining some of the appetite-suppressing benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"&gt;The search for simple, accessible weight management solutions continues to drive research into everyday ingredients like apple cider vinegar. While this latest study offers intriguing possibilities, particularly for younger populations struggling with weight management, the results should be interpreted as one potential tool within a comprehensive approach to health rather than a standalone solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Because it’s not only the exceptions who are redefining what is athletically possible later in life: &lt;a href="https://www.worldmarathonmajors.com/stars" target="_blank"&gt;the average age &lt;/a&gt;of a person finishing the World Marathon Majors is now 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Some recent science has helped bust myths around what people of middle-age and beyond can do safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;“We are still fighting the old message that people need to slow down when they hit a certain age, but there is no core reason to tell someone that they can’t keep training like an athlete,” said Scott Trappe, who studies human performance and aging, and is the director of the Human Performance Laboratory at Ball State University in Indiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="BodyImage__BodyImagePhoto-sc-xeeopr-0 hMFmrT l-align l-align--right"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/TNY3DRNHCFAKVADVXUSRWKN4PU.JPG?auth=048422dec690bcc068dbcea34d6f0bc7580cb5e567923951ed67b1116ab669b8&amp;amp;width=600&amp;amp;height=400&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;smart=true" aria-haspopup="true" data-photo-viewer-index="2"&gt;&lt;span class="u-visually-hidden"&gt;Open this photo in gallery:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-image-figcap c-image-figcap--block"&gt;&lt;div class="figcap-grid"&gt;&lt;div class="figcap-cc"&gt;&lt;p class="figcap-text"&gt;&lt;span class="caption text-gmr-4"&gt;Ed Whitlock, 74, crosses the finish line of the Scotiabank Toronto Waterfront Marathon in just over three hours on Sept. 25, 2005.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit text-gmr-5"&gt;Tibor Kolley/The Globe and Mail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;He explains how excessive caution in research has held back generations of seniors from exercising like athletes. In the 1980s, for example, studies showed that exercise did not lead to physiological adaptations in elderly people as it did in younger ones, suggesting that it may not be worth the trouble. As a result,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;many seniors limited their workouts to walking or &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070104013103/http://www.jazzercise.com/companyinfo.htm"&gt;jazzercise &lt;/a&gt;(look it up).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;But these studies, designed by researchers wary of injuring their participants, were not rigorous enough to generate physiological benefits, Trappe says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Later research uncovered that the body’s response to cardiovascular exercise does not change much with age: &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1540458/#:~:text=In%20conclusion%2C%20exercise%20enhances%20mitochondria,concomitant%20increases%20in%20mitochondria%20biogenesis."&gt;mitochondria still grow and multiply&lt;/a&gt;, capillary networks still &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/exercise-and-your-arteries"&gt;expand&lt;/a&gt; to improve blood flow, and metabolic enzymes still become more active and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4048572/#:~:text=Exercise%20requires%20a%20high%20amount,also%20by%20phosphorylating%20metabolic%20enzymes."&gt;better at converting fuel into energy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;The belief that intense exercise would probably harm healthy elderly people was shown to be a tall tale – one of the same flavour that led early 20th-century scientists to believe that women’s uteruses would &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17632029"&gt;fall out&lt;/a&gt; should they run a full marathon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;“If you keep training, the body continues to respond to exercise in a positive manner deep into life,” said Trappe, who at 58, trains and competes as a triathlete, and does a weekly pool workout with a former colleague, who is 89.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Exercising in old age does come with a long list of potential pitfalls. One of the biggest is expecting the same performance as in earlier years and failing to account for natural physiological decline – such as a less efficient heart and reduced blood volume – which can lead to overtraining or injury. Orthopedic challenges that were not a concern earlier in life, like a bum knee or hip, are also common. And exercising with health conditions like diabetes or cancer brings a whole new list of considerations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;A good way to set oneself up for vigorous exercise later in life is to do it earlier in life, too. &lt;a href="https://www.sleepclinic.be/wp-content/uploads/Long-term-Change-in-Cardiorespiratory-Fitness-and-All-Cause-Mortality.pdf"&gt;Cardiovascular fitness&lt;/a&gt;, or VO2 max, is one of the strongest predictors of all-cause mortality in the world, and strength training two to three times a week can help stave off a number of conditions including osteoporosis, cancer, diabetes, and heart issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;The good news is that we are entering a golden age of fitness across age groups. Multigenerational sports such as pickleball are thriving, while age-group competitions at major events such as marathons and Ironman races are drawing more participants. Advances in gear are also improving performance and making it easier than ever for athletes to train in ways that support recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;And then there is representation: The more we see people older than 30 accomplishing impressive sport feats, the more we come to expect it and may eventually try it for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Yet, all this does not mean that we are sailing toward a future where everyone runs marathons beyond retirement age. Our work lives, which have become more sedentary, make us less fit than they used to, Trappe says. This leads to huge differences in health between those who invest in their fitness early and throughout life, and those who do not. It reminds me of a phrase on a poster at the physiotherapy clinic I frequent in Toronto: It’s easier to maintain fitness than to build it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Trappe agrees. “In our current conditions, vigorous exercise may be the most powerful medicine out there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Globe and Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 19:41:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxOMG15dS15X3M2RXQwMDNCZlh3alYydTlNb0lDM1dRbUF0TldHRldfTnpubEZfN3hIbFdUUUthS3Nod2VNT3B2ekFjSU1rWU5CWUlhbW45cG0xR3o4dHlxZE10cEZPbzB0V1UwMVlCYVN2VWxvaDFsaDFQYlF6R2JGZEx5NnpGTXVIWmJBaHRqQlEzaXM5bTVCd1VvYzhGZ29PTlNGUWNwMmhvb2QwZlpRYlBB</guid></item><item><title>路易斯安那州、密苏里州和弗吉尼亚州报告2025年首例麻疹病例- NBC新闻 | Louisiana, Missouri and Virginia report first measles cases of 2025 - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPc1l0bjhnai1WaGtkX05rRGpXZUVRYmtfOWhCTXdnNnZENkduMEZnWExzaTAxeUJ5M2tHWE5UNHc5c2pMTmpnV1MxNVowaUwtYWJ3WFZpRnVXRko1QUlEREZrRFY3bXRqV2ZLMzBvQVVhMzAyUm5RSWlZMjVXcUFSQUpKUmN4TjJaRTFyU1Uxb1NLcUgzNVNXd2JDTXVVbmpYT0d6b2wya1h4YnPSAVZBVV95cUxNWENwVV9ITEdwdFBkU3pCdFdwdFQ5cVdKOTQ4V3BWUHNhRmN1V0dicnhDMWVkQWVqeUtVWE5rVFduRHVpZ29oZGk0dnZPa1E0VUowMDl5QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Louisiana, Missouri and Virginia have all reported their first measles cases in 2025, and they say all three patients’ cases are linked to international travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The most recently announced case in northwest Virginia is a child in the 0 to 4-year age range who had recently traveled internationally, according to the state’s health department.

Even given the outbreak, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has remained relatively silent on the public health threat, providing just weekly updates on its website and sending &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00522.html" target="_blank"&gt;an alert to doctors&lt;/a&gt; last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Earlier this month, the Texas Department of State Health Services said the measles toll in the state rose to &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;481 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt;, including six young children at a day care center in Lubbock.
