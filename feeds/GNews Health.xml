    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in seven Americans suffers migraines, but for women, that number is closer to one in five. This may be due to hormones like estrogen and menstrual cycles, as well as certain genes that increase susceptibility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, about one in eight Americans, or 40million, has reported taking a GLP-1 agonist like Victoza or Ozempic - which uses semaglutide as the active ingredient instead of liraglutide - at some point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, published earlier this month in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://headachejournal.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/head.14991"&gt;Headache&lt;/a&gt;, looked at 31 obese adults who had at least eight headache days per month or were diagnosed with chronic migraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chronic migraine, which impacts about 4million Americans, is defined as having at least 15 headache days in a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Study participants also had to have failed at least two standard migraine medications and have a body mass index (BMI) of at least 30, the threshold for obesity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vast majority, 26, were female, and the average participant age was 45.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were given a 0.6 milligram dose of liraglutide every day for one week and then a 1.2 milligram dose every day for the remainder of the four weeks. All participants were asked to stay on their current migraine drugs if they took them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using the patients' self-recorded symptom 'diaries,' the researchers found 15 patients had at least a 50 percent reduction in migraine frequency&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seven participants (23 percent) saw their migraines drop by 75 percent, and one patient had no headaches at all after the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On average, migraine days decreased from 20 to 11, a 42 percent difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;About one in eight Americans, or 40million, has reported taking a GLP-1 agonist like Victoza or Ozempic (pictured here)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also measured each patient's Migraine Disability Assessment Score (MIDAS), which defines how much their migraines can disable them and make them less functional at work, school or home on a given day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A higher score is associated with greater disability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found MIDAS scores decreased from 60 to 29 on average, a 52 percent difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants on average lost a small amount of weight, but it was not statistically significant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 42 percent of participants (13) had mild side effects including nausea and constipation, but all of them stayed on the medication.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations to the study, such as the small sample size and the lack of data on glucose or A1C levels, which are linked to diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team wrote: 'Future studies, with extended follow-up durations, and higher dose evaluations, are necessary to better understand the long-term tolerability and effectiveness of liraglutide in migraine prevention.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 16:17:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOZ0pRdjN3OU1XcHJIaGFoeDgxZndkUndJbklaTVJZbU9vY0tJcTF2VHNVRnNVcThpZm55VnFpQVJlU1JrR3JLSjdwUGVZdG1iTWFkY2Iwd2VVNXh1TlpORGZDSGE4STdzN0hIZ1hESnMxVWt6XzRvRW4weHJIWUFkYVNqNnY0dlNTM2dERm0wN0JNSDRNaUNodGRwOWQxamFreGxCNFV6WdIBrAFBVV95cUxNSnpUM0lPQ1RaUHBJaG9JWkJDak1oaXBHM0lVVjdIQnZ6Nk8xQng4MWRSWjJ2QTdVUFB0ejlNVldqZkxxUGlYX09aYXdBWmNqMDFlN0F0TXltU0xIemZxUWRmTVpwUWc3Q2V3bTJVYV9RM2dSV2ZQV3hKTXNRTEhlMTR4YUVjVnFqQ1A4LWI4enRBdWN6X3JkTlJoUVU1Z0tkUnV1M0F6VThsZDRR</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，关于衰老的常见假设可能是错误的-《纽约时报》 | A Common Assumption About Aging May Be Wrong, Study Suggests -

You know your own body,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;William Brogan, 47, from Hamilton, South Lanarkshire now faces major surgery to restore his face after medics were forced to amputate his nose &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After almost a year of doctors trying to relieve Mr Brogan's illness with antibiotics, the real devastating cause was revealed to be a form of cancer. Mr Brogan pictured here in 2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The antibiotics were helping at first but when I asked for more help I had to wait for an appointment. It got worse in that time waiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It took them over a year to get a biopsy and find it was cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They could have caught this nine months earlier before it travelled into my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now I've got a hole in my face and a triangle where they removed part of my nose.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After finally being diagnosed Mr Brogan had to undergo a marathon 20-hour operation to remove the cancer earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This sadly meant he had to have his nose as well as the upper gums of his mouth removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While medics attempted to rebuild the gum with healthy tissue taken from under his arm, this unfortunately proved unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This meant he needed another five-hour operation to remove the failed transplant, before another 12-hour surgery for another transplant to rebuild his upper mouth which did prove successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mr Brogan claims doctors dismissed his worries about his ongoing nose pain and that he believes his cancer could have been caught earlier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mr Brogan, pictured here before he lost his nose with his daughter Angel, hopes surgeons will be able to restore his face in the near future&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He has since been undergoing radiotherapy—where powerful radiation is used in an attempt to kill cancer cells— before medics attempt to rebuild his nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Brogan said losing his nose, and the extreme change to his appearance this had brought, had taken a huge mental toll on him and he was now on medication to help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Diazepane, used to relieve symptoms of anxiety, is the thing that gives me the courage to go out,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People say "there's that man with the hole in his face".'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he added he's hopeful for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said specialist surgeons having looked at photos of him prior to the amputation to ensure they can make him a nose that matches his previous appearance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm hoping to have a skin graft to try and rebuild my face within the year,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They've already taken a picture of my face, so they know what colour to make my nose. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I can't thank the surgeons enough.

People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don’t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective vaccine made from “killed” virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-62" data-gaid="inarticle-62"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LOVPLIVERBFSDGL347WZSX7MAE"&gt;People who have documentation that they had measles are immune and those born before 1957 generally don’t need the shots because so many children got measles back then that they have “presumptive immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-63" data-gaid="inarticle-63"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="B3QB4J3SAJFP7BU2HGR5WTCOZM"&gt;Measles has a harder time spreading through communities with high vaccination rates — above 95% — due to “herd immunity.” But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-64" data-gaid="inarticle-64"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="66WBOR6HFNGXROIROIMJZO7EOY"&gt;What are the symptoms of measles?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-65" data-gaid="inarticle-65"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RWT3CXMFLJEZDLB2K2GDQG4GR4"&gt;Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-66" data-gaid="inarticle-66"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WBTHEH6HUZE6REJADMXUJGGH6Q"&gt;The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet.

His 4-year-old son was at risk because he had received only the first of the vaccine’s two doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NOZP23QHEJH5TDFEBL7PI7QPTQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So, in mid-March, he took his family to a primary care clinic at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LXPHWXPXO5GRHGEX5CGOBJOCGI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;By the end of the visit, his son, Anh Hoang, had received one shot protecting against four illnesses — measles, mumps, rubella and chicken pox. He also received a second shot against tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough, as well as a flu shot.

Today the vaccine against chicken pox, or varicella, is sometimes combined into what is known as the MMRV vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4SJ5AUHKLFCP3MMB3OBYBHSSTM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A first dose of the MMR or MMRV vaccine is usually given between 12 and 15 months, with a second between ages 4 and 6. Experts may recommend vaccinating children at younger ages during an outbreak — like the ongoing U.S. measles outbreak, which has led to more than 1,200 cases, 750 of them in Texas. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 95 percent of the cases have occurred in unvaccinated people or those whose vaccine status is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZUVSXHMUJFFCNLIUGKHR2ZWTZ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Recommendations affecting administration and insurance coverage are made by the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&lt;/a&gt;. In June, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. replaced the committee, adding vaccine skeptics. The new panel, which &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/06/25/rfk-jr-vaccine-panel-acip-meeting/" target="_blank"&gt;met last week&lt;/a&gt;, is expected to scrutinize past recommendations, including for the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="Y44O6TEG3VCPVLI6TSE7GDLAFU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="Y44O6TEG3VCPVLI6TSE7GDLAFU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The final bill&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DQ3WPBOID5F2LADVT4ZLKJQV3I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;UTMB billed $2,532 for the boy’s office visit and three shots.

And, initially, the family was not offered assistance under the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccines for Children Program&lt;/a&gt;, a federally funded effort created after a measles outbreak more than 30 years ago, that provides free immunizations for uninsured and underinsured children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5PJW44JCBVERRAI5BK2I4DSVRU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So the family was exposed to the sticker shock of U.S. medical care without insurance, with providers setting prices. In this case, UTMB’s price for the child’s MMRV shot was about $1,400, more than five times what the CDC says it costs in the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="67SM7W32KVCUJISP7VIUAXOQLI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Nguyen was surprised when their insurer did not pay anything, leaving bills for his three children’s checkups that, combined, were close to $5,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4RKVJ32NDBARZPW64UPABHDGNU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He said the family’s income from his job in UTMB’s labs is less than $57,000 a year. Nguyen’s job provides him health insurance, but he balked at the $615 per month it would cost to cover his family, too, and instead purchased the one-year policy from TaiAn, which totaled $1,841. The policy covers certain types of office visits, emergency room care, hospitalization and chemotherapy, but not immunizations or checkups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AW5ZBPFYDBHIVITIXPQSPP4RBQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Nguyen and his wife, who are from Vietnam, are living in the country on temporary visas while he completes his studies.

But some plans are exempt from those rules, including short-term plans or travel insurance.

He said UTMB’s chargemaster had been updated a few months earlier and the vaccine prices for those who do not receive shots through the children’s vaccine program were listed at incorrectly high amounts, resulting in the price Nguyen’s son was charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="G2OAIIM5PRBEVD3C3TDGNLBAWE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Pickering said the prices had been corrected, though he declined to cite exact figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="TRC7DVJ62JCVXPRUE7YJDIIBEQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="TRC7DVJ62JCVXPRUE7YJDIIBEQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The resolution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QMXO4EBYNVAN5O47RL3XENKR2Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In addition to contacting the insurer, Nguyen approached the financial offices at UTMB, asking for a reduction or waiver of the fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RVIMNZG4QNBB3AINTDCY3QN3PA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In mid-May, UTMB sent Nguyen a revised bill for his son’s office visit. It applied a 50 percent self-pay discount, which its website says is offered to those who are uninsured. His revised total was $1,266, $711 of which was for the MMRV vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PKNC4D5F75H2ZHWKWVSYISIMZE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I expected them to waive the vaccination cost for my children or at least reduce it more, especially for MMRV vaccine,” said Nguyen, noting that his family would still be strapped trying to pay their bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5J4ZLOOZUVHNNB222URLBFY63Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After Pickering spoke with KFF Health News, a customer service representative contacted Nguyen, waiving the cost of the vaccines.

These "&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/brain-foods-rcna152259" target="_blank"&gt;brain foods&lt;/a&gt;" contain healthy fats, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals which nourish the brain in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d5f0b9" class="body-graf"&gt;Registered dietitian and author &lt;a href="https://www.franceslargemanroth.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Frances Largeman-Roth &lt;/a&gt;shares the No.1 food to boost brain health — and this budget-friendly, shelf-stable item may already be in your pantry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-e22683" class="body-heading"&gt;Dietitian Tip of the Day: Eat Canned, Fatty Fish to Boost Brain Health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c7d061" class="body-graf"&gt;Largeman-Roth's favorite brain-boosting food is fatty fish, specifically canned &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/are-sardines-healthy-rcna139842" target="_blank"&gt;sardines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/salmon-vs-tuna-rcna171831" target="_blank"&gt;wild-caught salmon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-981b13" class="body-graf"&gt;Fatty fish is rich in protein, healthy fats, vitamins and minerals which support overall health — but omega-3 fatty acids are the star brain-boosting nutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-954908" class="body-graf"&gt;“Our brains are mostly made up of omega-3s called EPA and DHA, so it makes sense that foods that contain these fats would help support brain health,” said Largeman-Roth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-56607c" class="body-graf"&gt;Adults need &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;1.1-1.6 grams of omega-3s per day.&lt;/a&gt; Most store-bought canned sardines and wild salmon contain 1–2 grams of EPA and DHA. They're also naturally &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/is-canned-fish-healthy-rcna150584" target="_blank"&gt;low in mercury&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f08227" class="body-graf"&gt;Compared to fresh seafood, &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/is-canned-fish-healthy-rcna150584" target="_blank"&gt;canned fish is just as healthy&lt;/a&gt; — it provides the same omega-3s and other nutrients in a pre-cooked, affordable package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-098c73" class="body-heading"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-be35e4" class="body-graf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/healthy-fat-food-rcna145846" target="_blank"&gt;omega-3s&lt;/a&gt; in canned fish can support brain health by reducing inflammation, supporting neuron growth, and protecting against cognitive decline, says Largeman-Roth. Eating &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/omega-3-foods-rcna137467" target="_blank"&gt;foods high in omega-3s&lt;/a&gt; may help&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9641984/" target="_blank"&gt; improve blood flow&lt;/a&gt; to the brain and boost cognition, memory and mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-129e61" class="body-graf"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-024-00150-8" target="_blank"&gt;study published in the journal Nature Aging&lt;/a&gt; shows that fatty acids are a top nutrient linked with healthy brain aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1f0529" class="body-graf"&gt;Eating &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26718417/" target="_blank"&gt;seafood just once a week&lt;/a&gt; is linked with a lower risk of Alzheimer’s, the most common form of dementia, says Largeman-Roth.

That decision came after discussions with the Food and Drug Administration, which is grappling with a massive overhaul under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the new data, the company plans to resubmit the application for the combination vaccine and file for approval of its standalone flu shot later this year, Stephen Hoge, the company's head of research and development, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If regulators approve the flu vaccine, the company can then advance the combination shot, Hoge said. He added that Moderna expects approvals for both shots next year pending reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the combination jab simplifies vaccination, which will "help the health-care system" by reducing workloads of doctors and nurses, slashing costs and improving uptake among patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company so far appears to be the frontrunner in the race against &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-4"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/PFE/"&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-5"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/NVAX/"&gt;Novavax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to bring a combination shot to the market. While Moderna does not have specific revenue projections for its individual products, Hoge said Covid, flu and respiratory syncytial virus are each multi-billion-dollar markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're obviously hoping that our products allow us to earn our fair share of them," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phase three trial followed more than 40,000 adults ages 50 and above, who were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of Moderna's shot, called mRNA-1010, or a standard competitor vaccine. Moderna's shot was 26.6% more effective than the other vaccine in the overall study population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mRNA-1010 jab also demonstrated strong efficacy for each of the major influenza strains in the shot, including A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and the B/Victoria lineages. Moderna said the vaccine's benefit was consistent across different age groups, people with various risk factors and previous vaccination status against the flu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In adults ages 65 and older, the shot was 27.4% more effective than the standard flu vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The efficacy results are "a significant milestone in our effort to reduce the burden of influenza in older adults," Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said in a release. "The severity of this past flu season underscores the need for more effective vaccines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderna cited &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-06.html" target="_blank"&gt;data &lt;/a&gt;from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that seasonal flu-related hospitalizations and outpatient visits reached a 15-year high during the 2024 to 2025 season of the virus.&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html#:~:text=The%20estimates%20on%20this%20page,have%20ranged%20from%20120%2C000%2D710%2C000" target="_blank"&gt; More than 600,000 Americans&lt;/a&gt; were hospitalized due to flu-related illness last year, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mRNA-1010 vaccine's safety data was consistent with previous results from another phase three study on the shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Moderna are down more than 30% for the year, fueled in large part by a string of moves by the Trump administration to change vaccine policy and undermine immunizations. The administration in May &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-cancels-more-700-million-funding-moderna-bird-flu-vaccine-2025-05-28/" target="_blank"&gt;canceled&lt;/a&gt; a contract awarded to Moderna for the late-stage development of its bird flu vaccine for humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about the uncertain regulatory environment in the U.S., Hoge said Moderna is engaging closely with the FDA to understand what its requirements are and how to satisfy them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I believe, as relates to flu, I think we've got a pretty clear path," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNBC</author><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 11:00:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxPQVpMcUZENjFQVy1RUXhCdUp6ZXBpenJfZ29wUWdvazRBcG1pN21NUm5hOXFoZjgyaHZ2SnJEYmo3OXhyQUdpTEVUbG9ueERVZVVHeElEQTJLYTdJTDEyWW1OcWg0bjlRWjVwbHdKQXRJYWtMSHFkSVRfRkFud3hZalJOUGdGX3Z4c2hTano0cWhHZmw1eEc1WWt1cTFueENXcWlmck4zXy1NVlhCUW5YeDZB0gG3AUFVX3lxTE44cUlVVDNYbE9QMkhRS3FtU09xdFZrLXJENjFQVDVIZEh0eDlRZTRrU0FqcmxFLU1KWk1xclZSQ3ZYQThvbElkYWJBSFhlVUNUT2g5NkwtT3ZYRTJtNjYySkVhUVlzMDFFZS1oQWJPTG1BMEFrYVZYNUZTeFFaTVZ6ZmFqX1FGYWdDT1YtTVdhUXpYYnFKOUc0VzZoUEJ2RE5QelBjSFlMLW9HMFVyb1RUdEVLZEdaaw</guid></item><item><title>SCURR博士揭示了如何控制握手，因为他揭示了震颤可以预示的令人担忧的疾病-每日邮报 | DR SCURR reveals how to control shaking hands as he reveals the worrying disease tremors can herald - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiywFBVV95cUxPcTFmenkyVnBvdk1GRGlMUWdLR0duZlRYekVpNE5oOURiOG5ONFBJc3ZFZkUyVVFPYTluRkxIeFZWa2t0NjUyYWdjVllQdDhGXy1MOHpKcXpZUW1xZm92cGhjUm02Mkp2cDRjMlktbDNIb2JzRzNLdy1CWXRRcVQzRC0zZVFhYURSajZRWXhCelVCT05KdnJTVmo1RVlSTzZiMEZuckpuTmVGRXB5TUJuQlBXaXZudndfdXY4SFc1MGp0SG4zdGRSWUN0SQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold"&gt;For the past three months, I have experienced a shaking right hand on occasions. My left hand is fine. I’m using a wrist support at night but it doesn’t seem to make a difference. People are starting to notice the tremor. What could be causing it? I’m 77 and reasonably fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;Kay Thornton, Watford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Martin Scurr replies:&lt;/span&gt; There are multiple causes of tremor – the most common is essential tremor. This is a neurological disorder which typically affects the hands – but the head and body may also be involved – and while it’s not in itself dangerous, it does tend to get worse over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can affect any age, but it typically occurs after the age of 40, though the cause is not clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medication to help manage the symptoms is essentially aimed at calming down the nervous system and includes drugs such as beta-blockers or gabapentin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medication can also cause tremor and you mention in your longer letter that you are on the antidepressant sertraline, which can, albeit in rare circumstances, be a trigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a drug-induced tremor is unlikely to involve only one hand – plus, you say you’ve been taking that drug without side-effects for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another possible cause of a tremor is Parkinson’s disease. In this case it often starts on one side, in the hand or at the wrist and the tremor improves with movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One possible cause of a tremor is Parkinson’s disease, which often starts on one side in the hand or at the wrist and the tremor improves with movement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One thing to note is that loss of smell, or anosmia, can occur even years before a tremor is observed in Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 90 per cent of people with Parkinson’s experience some degree of this – although I note you don’t mention issues with smell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;My advice is that you must discuss the symptoms with your GP, perhaps requesting referral to a neurologist for an expert opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold"&gt;When I last used hormone replacement therapy (HRT) aged 50, I had terrible depression and weight gain and had to come off it. Now my doctor has recommended using an oestrogen vaginal gel to combat poor urine flow. Should I try it again?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;Name and address supplied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Martin Scurr replies:&lt;/span&gt; In a word, yes! Your GP has given you exactly the advice that I would have given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You say in your longer letter that you are experiencing poor urine flow, meaning it takes a long time to empty the bladder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oestrogen, applied locally, helps improve the health of the tissue in the area and so improve flow. (Tissue changes related to the drop in oestrogen can result in the urethra – the tube which drains from the bladder – kinking to some degree.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HRT can cause the side-effects you describe and, in your longer letter, you say this was the case – even when you switched to a locally-applied vaginal oestrogen gel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, your experience is surprising – I have never seen this in my own practice – and it may be that the preparations you used in the past contained preservatives or stabilising agents that you were particularly sensitive to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite your previous adverse experience, I urge you to try an oestrogen gel again because if it’s successful and side-effect free, it’s likely to make a considerable difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If I’m wrong – and you do suffer an adverse reaction – then at least you can cease applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Perhaps it might be sensible to ask your GP to start you at a low dose, given your understandable concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-b78e7910-558e-11f0-b35c-9d25bdf4b749" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14860069/What-hands-starts-shaking-develop-tremor-reveals-DR-SCURR-worrying-disease.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;In My View... Don't ignore sudden hearing loss &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Muffled hearing can be brought on by all manner of things – but sudden, unexplained hearing loss must never be ignored as, in some cases, without urgent treatment, the hearing loss can become permanent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A common cause of sudden hearing loss is a viral infection (e.g. measles, mumps, flu) leading to damage to the inner ear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have noticed an increase in cases linked to Covid, but in truth there are plenty of examples where sudden hearing loss occurs out of the blue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those affected need urgent treatment with steroids – preferably prednisolone tablets, 60mg daily – as this brings the best chance of recovery with normal hearing gradually regained. (Steroids reduce damaging inflammation that may otherwise impact hearing nerves.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I’m flagging this so that anybody who experiences hearing loss in one ear doesn’t wait too long before being seen – a problem in this era when getting a GP appointment can be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But sudden hearing loss in one ear is an emergency. The ear must be inspected promptly, certainly within seven days, and treatment with steroids really is essential.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It's benign because we've got vaccination', Lord Vallance told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/parents-have-forgotten-that-measles-kills-says-lord-vallance-frjzbz3sb"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 65-year-old added that to see people—most often children—die from entirely preventable disease was 'tragic'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'People used to have 12 children because they knew five were going to die. It doesn't happen like that anymore and vaccination has been a major part of it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles usually starts with flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough and runny nose and is often followed by a tell-tale rash which starts on the face and behind the ears before spreading to the rest of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it can trigger more serious and even fatal health complications if it spreads to the lungs or the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dubbed 'the world's most infectious disease', it can spread to nine in 10 unvaccinated children in a classroom if just one classmate is carrying the bug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lord Vallance, the Government's chief scientific adviser during the pandemic, is urging parents to get their children vaccinated against potentially life-threatening childhood diseases &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cold-like symptoms, such as a fever, cough and a runny or blocked nose, are usually the first signal of measles. A few days later, some people develop small white spots on the inside of their cheeks and the back of their lips&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One in five children who catch the disease will be hospitalised, according to estimates, with one in 15 developing life-threatening complications like meningitis or sepsis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lord Vallance was speaking in the wake of a surge in measles in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles cases soared in 2024 with 2,911 cases confirmed in England—the highest number on record since 2012—and tragically one death recorded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite surging rates of infections uptake of a vaccine designed to protect children against the disease has fallen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Less than 84 per cent of five-year-olds in the nation had both recommended doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have labelled the figures concerning and urged parents to vaccinate their children to avoid the 'life-long consequences' of potential measles infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it's not just the MMR jab.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lord Vallance's warning comes as data shows none of the 14 childhood vaccines offered on the NHS met the 95 per cent uptake target needed for herd immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts labelled the figures as concerning and urged parents to vaccinate their children to avoid the 'life-long consequences' of a potential measles infection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Herd immunity is a public health concept where enough people are vaccinated that it stops diseases spreading rampantly through the population as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have blamed post-pandemic scepticism and vaccine fatigue for the rapidly declining rates, with Vallance also pointing the finger at, now &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12319495/Disgraced-ex-doctor-cum-godfather-anti-vaxx-movement-Andrew-Wakefield-returns-old-tricks-Andrew-Wakefield-urging-parents-not-kids-jabs-new-podcast-sparking-fury-medics.html"&gt;thoroughly debunked&lt;/a&gt;, rumours linking the MMR jab to autism for causing 'huge problems around the world'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, together with health chiefs, he is urging parents to get their children vaccinated—with two doses of the MMR jab offering up to 99 per cent protection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as concerning figures released last week revealed nearly half of children in some parts of England haven't had both MMR jabs by the time they turn five. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data shows just 52.7 per cent of youngsters that age in Kensington and Chelsea in west London are fully vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;London remains one of the least vaccinated parts of the country—taking up a staggering 19 of the top 20 spots for low MMR jab uptake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Outside of London, Nottingham was worst with just 71.4 per cent of children jabbed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Doug Brown, Chief Executive of the British Society for Immunology, told MailOnline: 'Vaccination is the safest and most effective way to protect your child against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Measles is a serious disease that can make children very ill and cause life-long consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In the 2024 measles outbreak in England, one in five children who contracted the disease needed to be admitted to hospital for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'To be fully protected against contracting measles, it is essential that children receive two doses of the MMR vaccine at the correct timepoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We need to redouble efforts to implement the NHS Vaccine Strategy and engage with communities to ensure that all children receive the MMR vaccine and are protected against these nasty diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is never too late to get vaccinated—if you're concerned that your child has missed out on a vaccination, contact your GP surgery.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lord Vallance became a household name during the Covid pandemic, appearing next to Boris Johnson and his chief medical officer Sir Chris Whitty during tense Downing Street briefings to talk the nation through the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he also earned the nicknamed 'Dr Doom' during the period for being the face of bleak projections from scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 10:22:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>喝了一杯啤酒，网球冠军就喝醉了……这是致命癌症在年轻人中上升的迹象--《每日邮报》 | Tennis champ gets tipsy after one beer...it was a sign of deadly cancer that's rising in young people -

I told him I was driving, and he asked me to pull over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Then I knew it was bad news. He said they suspected cancer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In February 2024, Simon underwent a successful operation to remove both the initial and secondary lumps in his neck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Four months later he began a year-long course of immunotherapy to prevent recurrence and started a regular schedule of routine MRI and CT scans to monitor for changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But within nine months the cancer had spread to his brain—and suddenly some of the symptoms he had been experiencing began to make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Simon said: 'To be honest, I didn't feel right in my head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I started having blurred vision again, and I couldn't switch off at night.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Simon with one of his tennis students—since his diagnosis with brain cancer he's been unable to hold a racket &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The following month, Simon underwent a highly targetted form of radiotherapy to blast the tumour in his brain, and eventually resumed immunotherapy drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after just one dose of the drug in March 2025, Simon became violently ill and was unable to use the toilet due to his bowel not functioning properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was hospitalised for 10 days and placed on a high dose of steroids to help combat the symptoms, which caused severe nerve damage to his legs and hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Simon said: 'I felt numb, battered. It was like I'd been hit by a truck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've got wobbly legs now and a right hand that can barely grip a racket, let alone type. But I'm still trying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That hospital stay nearly broke me. When I got home, I'd just burst into tears for days. It stripped away everything that felt like me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Simon is currently taking a pause from treatment and meeting with his oncology team to determine the next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Half of those with melanoma that's spread to other parts of the body will not survive longer than five years, according to studies.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Simon has been supported by his wife Tracey, and has started a GoFundMe &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Melanoma is caused by cellular damage from UV and UVB rays from the sun and tanning beds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And recent research suggests that the disease is on the rise in younger people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, researchers from the US found that cases of five particular cancers were rising in adults under 50: melanoma, along with cervical cancer, stomach cancer, cancer of the bones and joints, and plasma cell neoplasms—a type of cancer affecting the lymph system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, seperate UK studies have identified a seven per cent rise in young people, aged 25-49 over the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A common misconception is that melanoma solely affects the skin on the face, body, and limbs, but it can also develop on other areas vulnerable to sun damage—the mouth, scalp, nail beds, soles of the feet, palm of the hands and fingers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To avoid the disease, experts advise using sunscreen with a high SPF, applying it 30 minutes before going outside, covering up as much as possible to avoid sunburn, and keeping babies and children out of the sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In May, Simon launched a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/simon-bowler-the-start-of-my-journey-and-only-17-months-in"&gt;GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt;, which has now raised nearly £7,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He's using the funds to start a new business selling tennis accessories and plans to donate a portion of sales to Macmillan, the NHS, and mental health charities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's OK to cry,' he said. 'It's OK to admit you're not OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've been stripped of a lot of my identity—but I haven't lost my will to keep going.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I just want to get back to helping people, mentoring young players, and showing them what resilience looks like.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;People who have lost the ability to move or speak may soon have a new option: surgically implanted devices that link the brain to a computer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More than two decades after researchers first &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04970" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;demonstrated&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that a person could move a computer cursor with their thoughts, several firms are poised to take the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2011/05/12/135598390/mind-reading-technology-turns-thought-into-action" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;brain-computer interface&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (BCI) from experimental curiosity to commercial product.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We know it works, we know the enabling technologies are now ready," says Michael Mager, the CEO of &lt;a href="https://precisionneuro.io/about" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Precision Neuroscience&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "It's time to turn this academic work into a thriving industry that can make a big impact on people's lives."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Already, experimental brain-computer interfaces have been implanted in dozens of people. The latest devices go under the skin and can communicate wirelessly with a smartphone or tablet.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Elon Musk's &lt;a href="https://neuralink.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Neuralink&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the most visible player in the BCI field. But the first product to reach the market may well come from competitors including Precision, &lt;a href="https://blackrockneurotech.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Blackrock Neurotech&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.paradromics.com/product" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Paradromics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://synchron.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Synchron&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some of these companies, like Blackrock, have much more experience than Neuralink. Others use less invasive, and potentially safer, technology that may make it easier to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first BCI customers are likely to be people living with paralysis from a spinal injury or &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/08/23/1195438289/these-experimental-brain-implants-can-restore-speech-to-paralyzed-patients" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (ALS). Early products will allow them to control a computer cursor, or &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/07/14/1016028911/experimental-brain-implant-lets-man-with-paralysis-turn-his-thoughts-into-words" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;generate artificial speech&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Neuralink's 'telepathy'&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Implanted BCIs work by detecting and decoding signals coming from areas of the brain that control movement or speech. These signals indicate when a person is trying to move a limb or speak a word.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;A BCI system typically includes sensors that detect brain activity, an interface that processes the signals, and an external device that turns thought into action. The result: A cursor moves, a prosthetic hand reaches, a synthetic voice speaks the words a person is trying to articulate.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Imagine the joy of connecting with your loved ones, browsing the web, or even playing games using only your thoughts," says the narrator of a promotional video from Neuralink.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The company, which did not respond to requests for an interview, calls this capability "telepathy."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Neuralink pushed BCIs into the public imagination in early 2024, thanks to a charismatic and resilient man with paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;A diving accident left Noland Arbaugh unable to move from the shoulders down. At 29, he became the first person to get Neuralink's device.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A robot threaded more than a thousand electrodes into his brain's motor cortex at the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIAsUkJZbow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Barrow Neurological Institute&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Phoenix. Then, human surgeons there installed a wireless interface about the size of a quarter in his skull.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, Arbaugh was on stage at Neuralink's headquarters in Fremont, California, &lt;a href="https://x.com/neuralink/status/1771298952974921805?lang=en" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;describing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; his experience controlling a computer cursor.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's freakin' wild," he said. "When I first moved it just by thinking, it blew my mind for like a day. I just could not wrap my head around it."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;A video featuring Arbaugh's remarks has attracted more than 25 million views on Musk's social media platform, X.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the success was tempered by Neuralink's &lt;a href="https://neuralink.com/blog/prime-study-progress-update-user-experience/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;announcement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks later that some of the threads of electrodes in Arbaugh's brain had "retracted," making the device less sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since then, Neuralink has reported implanting its BCI in at least six other people. But details about those experiments remain scant.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A new technology, decades old&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While Neuralink's surgical robots and wireless electronics are new, using thoughts to move a cursor isn't.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.braingate.org/team/leigh-hochberg-m-d-ph-d/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Leigh Hochberg&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — who holds positions at Brown University and Massachusetts General Hospital — was part of a team that pioneered the approach in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Their subject was Matt Nagle, a man who was living with paralysis after being stabbed in the neck. Hochberg's team linked Nagle's brain to a computer using old-fashioned wires that passed through his skull.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A research &lt;a href="https://www.braingate.org/publication-videos/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;video&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from 2004 shows Nagle using his thoughts to open an email.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was exactly what was supposed to happen," Hochberg says. "And even for all of us that were expecting it — there was a little bit of magic there."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Nagle died in 2007 of an infection unrelated to the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;BrainGate evolved into an academic consortium directed by Hochberg. And in June 2025, a team at the University of California, Davis &lt;a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/brain-computer-interface-allows-man-als-speak" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that a BrainGate 2 BCI allowed a man with ALS to speak through a computer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I. Am. Good," the synthesized voice says in a video accompanying the study. The speech is slightly halting, spoken one word a time. But the voice sounds human — it was constructed from old audio of the man speaking.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Experiments like that one show how computer interfaces have improved, Hochberg says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Instead of monitoring a few dozen neurons, they may listen to thousands. Instead of sending information out through wires, they use wireless protocols. And instead of interfacing with a wall of computers, the signals may go to a single laptop or tablet.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another big change is that scientists keep finding ways to decode brain activity "more accurately, more consistently and more reliably," Hochberg says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the past few years, that has meant employing artificial intelligence to recognize the neural activity patterns that reveal a person's intention to speak, or pick up a bar of chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The field has also become specialized, Hochberg says, with some groups focused on decoding speech while others work on improving control of robotic limbs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are even groups "focused on putting information back into the brain," Hochberg says, which can add a sense of touch to a robotic arm or hand.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Fingers that feel&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The University of Pittsburgh is among the leaders in providing sensory feedback through a brain-computer interface.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You can't have fine and dextrous motor control with visual feedback alone," says &lt;a href="https://www.rnel.pitt.edu/people/jennifer-l-collinger-phd" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jennifer Collinger&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh. You need that sense of touch to be able to respond in a natural way."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;With touch feedback, the user can tell when an artificial finger makes contact with an object or when an artificial hand is holding a cup tightly enough to keep it from falling.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So Collinger and her colleagues have been working with Blackrock Neurotech, whose brain interface technology has been used experimentally in dozens of people.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of those people is &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/10/13/497716281/brain-implant-restores-sense-of-touch-to-paralyzed-man" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nathan Copeland&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who was paralyzed in a car accident. In 2016, Copeland famously used a robotic arm to bump fists with President Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In 2021, Copeland was part of a study that showed how a sense of touch improved his ability to grasp and manipulate objects with his prosthetic hand.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"With sensation, I could feel that the hand had made contact," Copeland said in a 2021 interview with NPR. "I could also tell if I had a firm grip on it or not."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But advanced features like sensory feedback aren't going to appear in the first implanted devices on the market, Collinger says. Instead, they are likely to offer control of a computer cursor, much like BrainGate did in those lab experiments more than 20 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's been enough consistent success that now companies are saying, 'Okay we can offer a first-generation device to people that will offer some kind of benefit to them,'" Collinger says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of those companies is Precision Neuroscience, which was cofounded by &lt;a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/benjamin-rapoport" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ben Rapoport&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neurosurgeon and engineer who had previously helped start Neuralink.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Precision's other co-founder and CEO, Michael Mager, says the company's short-term goal is a wireless device that allows a person with paralysis to operate a smartphone or computer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We think about accessing news and entertainment, we think about productivity software like Microsoft Office, Word, Powerpoint, Excel," Mager says. "If you can operate those programs as well as someone who is able-bodied, it's quality-of-life enhancing — and it's also potentially enabling for people to go back to work."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Precision's device differs from Neuralink's because it doesn't insert its electrodes into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have a very, very thin film that is designed to sit on the surface of the brain without penetrating into or damaging the brain," Mager says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;That makes the implant safer and less invasive, Mager says, which could make it easier to get approval from the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Synchron avoids opening the skull entirely. Its electrodes are delivered through blood vessels using technology designed to place stents in blocked arteries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;All of these devices face some common challenges, Mager says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We're sampling from thousands of electrodes, thousands of times a second, and the amount of data that comes off of these systems is just enormous," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It is far too much data to transmit through existing wireless links. So companies are working on ways to reduce or compress the data.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another obstacle is the cost to conduct the sort of clinical trials required by the FDA. That will probably be hundreds of millions of dollars, Mager says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even so, Mager thinks his company and several others, including Neuralink, have the resources and expertise to turn the brain interface concept into a marketable product.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That won't take another 20 years, he says. Perhaps another two or three.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

My meager effort pales in comparison to the 15,000, 20,000, or even 30,000 steps I see influencers on my feed bragging about regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The algorithm likes to remind me of my shortcomings.

But quantifying your every step, tracking every ounce of protein ingested, or hours slept can border on obsessive. The current cultural fixation on nutrition and fitness also speaks to a shift toward &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/06/1217547155/skinny-fascism-black-anime"&gt;beauty standards that once again idealize thinness&lt;/a&gt;. Mix that with &lt;a href="/even-better/370224/the-impossible-promise-of-making-it"&gt;American hustle culture&lt;/a&gt;, and you have a recipe for turning a low-key activity into a compulsion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“This all comes down to how much our culture values productivity above everything else,” says &lt;a href="https://www.columbiacardiology.org/profile/keith-diaz-phd"&gt;Keith Diaz&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of behavioral medicine at Columbia University Medical Center. “It’s just another metric that we measure ourselves by.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="from-leisure-to-optimization" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;From leisure to optimization&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Walking is perhaps one of the most functional and accessible forms of movement: It gets you where you want to go, and you don’t need any special equipment to do it. The vast majority of people walk at some point during their day without having to think too much about it. It makes sense, then, that walking has come in and out of fashion as a form of exercise throughout history. In the late 1800s, &lt;a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/one-of-americas-first-spectator-sports-was-professional-walking-180985397/"&gt;leisure walking became a popular sport&lt;/a&gt;. A century later, at the height of the fitness boom in the 1980s, walking got a rebrand and a refresh, thanks to a book called &lt;a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/heavyhands-walking-workout/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heavyhands&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; touting the benefits of walking with weights. “That became,” says &lt;a href="https://danielle-friedman.com/"&gt;Danielle Friedman&lt;/a&gt;, the author of &lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/645493/lets-get-physical-by-danielle-friedman/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let’s Get Physical: How Women Discovered Exercise and Reshaped The World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “a way to make walking not seem weak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;To achieve a textbook hot girl walk, you must walk four miles while expressing gratitude and envisioning your goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The pandemic was a major boon for walking. With gyms and fitness studios closed and cabin fever setting in, many took to strolling as a way to get moving out of the house. Walking was gentler and less punishing than the high-intensity fitness trends of the early 2000s, Friedman says. “The pendulum swung a little bit more toward just appreciating movement for movement’s sake,” she says. But as social media caught on — the original “&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hot-girl-walk-viral-fitness-trend-explained-tips/"&gt;hot girl walk&lt;/a&gt;” clip was posted on TikTok in January 2021 — walks became more performative. Walking now had a purpose. To achieve a textbook hot girl walk, for instance, you must walk four miles while expressing gratitude and envisioning your goals. Over time, the step counts ballooned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Keeping careful track of your mileage also has a long history. The first modern pedometer was &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5488109/"&gt;designed in 1965 in Japan&lt;/a&gt;. Called the manpo-kei, or 10,000 steps meter, this simple act of marketing helped cement the 10,000-step threshold as a benchmark that one should strive to hit for good health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The science doesn’t quite back up the marketing. Recent research has found that among women in their 70s, as few &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31141585/"&gt;as 4,400 steps a day is related to lower mortality&lt;/a&gt;, compared to 2,700 steps or less. Those who walked more had even less risk for early mortality, but those benefits tapered off at more than about 7,500 steps. Another study of middle-aged adults found that &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763292"&gt;those who took 8,000 steps&lt;/a&gt; were less likely to die early from heart disease and cancer compared to those who only took 4,000 steps. Again, the benefits plateaued after 8,000 steps. Similar findings suggest that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34477847/"&gt;7,000 steps&lt;/a&gt; was the magic number (the studies, it should be noted, were observational and could not prove causation.) If you’re walking for health, 7,000 to 8,000 steps, however, seems like a pretty good bet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These days, everyone’s got a step counter in their pocket or on their wrist. Health tracking apps on phones and wearables like the &lt;a href="/technology/417713/apple-watch-oura-whoop-health-tracking-fitness"&gt;Apple Watch, Oura, Fitbit, and Whoop&lt;/a&gt; have made it much easier to account for every single step. Health-related tracking can be extremely motivating when it &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0144929X.2020.1801840#d1e302"&gt;comes to behavior change&lt;/a&gt;. When you have specific health or fitness goals, tracking is a good way to measure success. “You have a target and you have a means to measure it,” Diaz says, “which is great.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;At the same time, you should want to engage in that activity because you like it and not because your watch or an influencer is telling you to move. Unless you’re intrinsically motivated to achieve that goal — &lt;em&gt;I walk because I like the way it feels&lt;/em&gt; — tracking can veer into compulsion. Once you’ve hit a benchmark of 10,000 or 15,000 or 20,000 steps, you may feel compelled to meet, or exceed, it every day or else fall into a shame and anxiety spiral. “When the Fitbit first came out,” Diaz says, “I used it for a couple weeks, and I just had to put it away because I couldn’t do it anymore. If I didn’t hit 10,000 steps in a day, it’d be nine o’clock at night and…I’d be circling my little, tiny living room for 20 minutes just to get my steps to where I need them to be. I’m sitting there, like how is this healthy in any way, shape, or form that I’m obsessing over a number?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;Although quantifying an activity increases how often you do it, you start to enjoy it less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Soon, something that previously brought you enjoyment can start to feel like work. Although quantifying an activity (like counting steps or the number of pages read) increases how often you do it, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/42/6/967/2358309"&gt;you start to enjoy it less&lt;/a&gt;, a 2016 study found. This change can happen within a few days of tracking, the study’s author &lt;a href="https://scholars.duke.edu/person/jordan.etkin"&gt;Jordan Etkin&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of marketing at Duke University, says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;When participants were able to see their results, they would continue the activity. But when they weren’t shown their data, they lost the motivation to continue. “The reasons for doing the activity shift from being because you like it or find some other value in it,” Etkin says, “to being because it gives you this sense of accomplishment and productivity. When you don’t get that anymore, because you’re not tracking how many of these things you’re doing, it’s less valuable to you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Instead of just moving for movement’s sake, perpetual tracking assigns status and morality to basic bodily functions. Hitting a certain step count is “good” and having a low readiness score is “bad.” The number acts as a marker of wellness. These days, the ideal embodiment of that wellness has &lt;a href="/culture/415457/summer-bodies-tiktok-fitness-gym-pilates-detox-gen-z"&gt;pivoted back toward thinness&lt;/a&gt;. No longer is a step just a step or a gram of protein a bit of nourishment — it’s all in service of optimization of a skinnier, healthier self. People who track their health want every step to count, to matter, Etkin says. If it isn’t being documented, it may as well not have happened. “That introduces new dynamics into how people decide what and whether and when to do things,” she says, “based on whether it’s going to be recorded.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;By no means should you stop walking if it improves your mental and physical health. But if the pressure of hitting a specific target every day causes anxiety or you’re unable to forgo walking for a day, you may need to reconsider your relationship with your goals. This is “because you’re obsessing over this outward signal, and it becomes this unhealthy striving for perfectionism,” Diaz says. People can start to ignore their body’s cues for rest and push themselves to injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In order to maintain a more flexible outlook on your goals, Diaz suggests setting a range target — maybe 8,000 to 12,000 steps a day — or weekly benchmarks. If you know you’re going to be moving a lot on the weekend, you won’t be so fixated on a weekday where your step count is lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Any wellness lifestyle should be sustainable. If your body and schedule allow for 20,000 steps a day, go for it. If it feels like a chore, you run the risk of burning out. It’s worth asking yourself if any of your fitness-related hobbies are still enjoyable or if they inspire stress or obligation, Diaz says. Fitness isn’t always fun, but it should, hopefully, relieve anxiety, not cause it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxOVW43YVh1TTRDeDdJcFdIWXlKeEhYNGxSdVhFVjdlRWhpX3BoR3pmZ2pHbDMyNjlZaFJ0X0ZxaFBwYlBKOEdhcFZJblhCUE5VYXgyWEZWRmgxVjJQX3kyMXl5Y3pncWpCTF84R3dHLUpfdVF1eFIzdU95dGtlSlBXMGhrT2lxdnJIWkhGdGZ6bldNc1E</guid></item><item><title>关于童年素食主义的十大须知--英国广播公司 | Ten things to know about veganism in childhood - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxOMEFpcWdMSXZtanU0cDNVaWl1ODBQWXp0RU1zZ2ctX0JLQWFfYzE4RkpCZjhRTmlDdXFYblNwUG10OUtLZ0FvUU5OVDRub3NvaUZGNVljOG9MUXFuaVB3aEpidjIxWWdIZW9rdXlPb3ZzY2tucFN2Um1tOWlfTFMwYk5qSW45S0hpcnVLT2w4T3JoNTA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;Ten things to know about veganism in childhood&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250616-143050-043f96f72f-web-2.23.1-5/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lltbqr.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lltbqr.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lltbqr.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lltbqr.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lltbqr.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lltbqr.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lltbqr.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lltbqr.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lltbqr.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lltbqr.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Alamy A young girl scowling, wearing sunglasses and sipping a glass of juice at the beach (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Alamy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;(Credit: Alamy)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="here's-what-the-experts-say-about-the-benefits-and-risks-of-veganism-in-childhood." class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;Here's what the experts say about the benefits and risks of veganism in childhood.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Veganism is &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44488051" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;on the rise&lt;/a&gt; in certain parts of the world.

"So, if you're eating a steak you're getting a lot of protein, iron, zinc and some micronutrients from that beef." However, Amati points out that along with those things, you're also getting saturated fat and certain chemicals like carnitine – a nutrient which plays a role in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Carnitine-HealthProfessional/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;energy production&lt;/a&gt; – and which is thought to increase inflammation in the gut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Whereas, if you look at, say, an edamame [a type of young, immature soybean] you're getting good amounts of protein, but you're also getting fibre, and bioactive compounds that are &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fpls.2024.1488772/full" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;beneficial for health&lt;/a&gt; such as vitamins, minerals and polyphenols," says Amati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So far, so good for veganism – as long as you have a balanced diet.

Two-thirds of the vegan and vegetarian children in the study took vitamin B12 supplements, but overall vegan children had lower calcium levels and were at greater risk of iron, vitamin D and vitamin B12 deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The study showed that vegan children's health differed in several ways from omnivorous kids who ate meat and dairy. The good news was that vegan children were leaner and had lower cholesterol levels, which could potentially lead to a lower risk of heart disease later in life. They also showed reduced signs of inflammation in their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;&lt;span id="6.-vegan-children-might-be-slightly-less-tall" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="6.-vegan-children-might-be-slightly-less-tall" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;6.

"They have a tendency to be slightly smaller and lighter, but we don't know if those vegan children are going to catch up when they're teenagers," says Desmond.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The most concerning finding, however, was that vegan children had a 6% lower bone mineral density than omnivores. This could put them at risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures in later life. "We only have a short window where we build our bones, which is up until the age of around 25 to 30," says Desmond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250616-143050-043f96f72f-web-2.23.1-5/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lltd54.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lltd54.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lltd54.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lltd54.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lltd54.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lltd54.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lltd54.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lltd54.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lltd54.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lltd54.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images As with omnivorous diets, it's best to steer clear of ultra-processed foods where possible (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;As with omnivorous diets, it's best to steer clear of ultra-processed foods where possible (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"From then on, our bone mineral content goes downwards.

Both vitamin D and calcium are essential for building and maintaining healthy bones, however Desmond points out that although the vegan children in her 2021 study had lower calcium intakes than vegetarian and omnivore children, it was only slightly lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I think it's a combination of factors," says Desmond. "I don't think it's as easily solved as taking a calcium pill, because it could be due to the quality of plant protein, which is less growth promoting than animal protein."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Eating more animal protein is thought to stimulate the release of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522035365?via%3Dihub" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;certain growth factors&lt;/a&gt;. These molecules – usually proteins – can send signals to the body to encourage it to grow faster. Growth factors play a crucial role in making bones stronger and are involved in both bone growth and repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, Amati points out that these results are just from one study, and therefore the link between a vegan diet in childhood and bone density is yet to be definitively proven. "I think it's an important study, but it's one study on a small amount of children. So, what this study says to me is that we need to actually do more research to really understand what factors in their diet are putting children at higher risk," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;&lt;span id="7.-a-carefully-planned-vegan-diet-is-probably-safe-for-children" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="7.-a-carefully-planned-vegan-diet-is-probably-safe-for-children" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;7.

"I'd say based on what we know now, we can say a vegan diet [in childhood] is safe, but needs to be done responsibly," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This view is shared by Tom Sanders, emeritus professor of nutrition and dietetics at King's College London, who has researched vegan diets since the 1970s. "We showed &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://anthropogoniques.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/growth-of-british-vegan-children-sanders-1988.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;years ago&lt;/a&gt; that kids could be brought up in on vegan diet, providing you avoided the known pitfalls," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So, what are &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/how-to-eat-a-balanced-diet/the-vegan-diet/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the best foods to eat&lt;/a&gt; to make sure you are maximising your intake of nutrients normally found in meat and dairy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;&lt;span id="8.-some-foods-are-fortified-with-important-nutrients,-such-as-b12,-calcium-and-vitamin-d" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="8.-some-foods-are-fortified-with-important-nutrients,-such-as-b12,-calcium-and-vitamin-d" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;8.

"Absorption [of iron] can be a bit less efficient, but that can be overcome if you pair it with vitamin C-rich foods like peppers, tomatoes and citrus fruits," says Amati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For the omega-3 fatty acids, flax seeds, chia seeds and walnuts are good sources of ALA, while vegans can take omega-3 supplements made from seaweed and algae to maximise their intake of EPA and DHA – the omega-3 oils found in fish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;&lt;span id="9.-it's-best-to-avoid-ultra-processed-vegan-food-where-possible" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="9.-it's-best-to-avoid-ultra-processed-vegan-food-where-possible" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;9.

"We do sometimes see people who have vegan diets, but they're just buying vegan cheese, and vegan chicken nuggets, so the quality of their diet is still poor," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"If you have an unhealthy vegan diet where you're not thinking about the variety of nutrients, and you're just taking supplements, then you won't have good health outcomes," says Amati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;&lt;span id="10.-doing-your-research-is-important" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="10.-doing-your-research-is-important" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;10.

But despite this being commonly discussed, scientists haven’t really studied it. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="link " href="https://cnlm.uci.edu/chrastil/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Liz Chrastil;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liz Chrastil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, an associate professor of neurobiology and behavior at the UC Irvine Center for the Neurobiology of Learning &amp;amp; Memory, sought to change that. She had her own brain scanned 26 times before, during and after pregnancy to document the physical changes in a way that had never been done before. Chrastil shares with writer Korin Miller the inspiration behind her research, what it was like to be on the other side of science and what she hopes will happen next.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I’m a researcher who specializes in learning and memory, and I use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) regularly in my work. But the tables turned, and I ended up becoming the subject of a study of the human brain during pregnancy when I was trying to conceive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I was inspired by &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="link " href="https://jacobs.psych.ucsb.edu/people/laura-pritschet" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Laura Pritschet;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Laura Pritschet&lt;/a&gt;, a graduate student working at the University of California, Santa Barbara, under my colleague, &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="link " href="https://jacobs.psych.ucsb.edu/people/emily-jacobs" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Emily Jacobs;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Emily Jacobs&lt;/a&gt;. Pritschet had recently finished a study on herself on how the menstrual cycle impacts the brain, and it made me think I should do the same during my pregnancy journey in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I went through in vitro fertilization, so I had a great idea of the timing of my pregnancy. All that was left to do was to track myself, and I did — over 26 MRI scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="i-wasnt-nervous-to-undergo-mris-during-my-pregnancy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wasn’t nervous to undergo MRIs during my pregnancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I’m used to doing MRIs quite a bit, given my field. I know that the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2017/10/guidelines-for-diagnostic-imaging-during-pregnancy-and-lactation#:~:text=Ultrasonography%20and%20magnetic%20resonance%20imaging%20(MRI)%20are%20not%20associated%20with,medical%20benefit%20to%20the%20patient." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American College of;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;American College of &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2017/10/guidelines-for-diagnostic-imaging-during-pregnancy-and-lactation#:~:text=Ultrasonography%20and%20magnetic%20resonance%20imaging%20(MRI)%20are%20not%20associated%20with,medical%20benefit%20to%20the%20patient." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Obstetricians and;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Obstetricians and &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2017/10/guidelines-for-diagnostic-imaging-during-pregnancy-and-lactation#:~:text=Ultrasonography%20and%20magnetic%20resonance%20imaging%20(MRI)%20are%20not%20associated%20with,medical%20benefit%20to%20the%20patient." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gynecologists;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt; says that MRIs are not linked with pregnancy risk and are the imaging techniques of choice when they’re needed during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;MRI uses a magnet, and there are no injections or radiation. There are no known risks, but we looked at studies of people who had done MRIs during pregnancy for medical reasons, and there were no safety concerns. I did want to be cautious about sound, so we put some foam in the machine as an added precaution to muffle the sound the scanner makes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After that, I worked with my collaborators to come up with the protocols that would be needed for the scans. It ended up being that I simply made appointments to be in the MRI scanner and to do blood draws as well. I tried to time the blood draws to happen just before the scans so the data would be gathered as close together as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="each-session-took-about-40-minutes"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Each session took about 40 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The MRI sessions weren’t short. We did about six or seven different scans each time, ultimately taking about 40 minutes each. I did 26 scans overall, which means I spent more than 1,000 minutes in an MRI scanner before, during and after my pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;During each scan, I had to get set up, be positioned well and just try to get comfortable. Later on in my pregnancy, it was more important just to be comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I had to lay still and stay awake for one of the scans, so I would just think about whatever I wanted during that time. We made a point to do that scan first, and it usually was over in 10 minutes. After that, I would just rest or fall asleep during the other scans. I usually slept — I was pregnant, after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="we-made-some-surprising-findings"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We made some surprising findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The research on my brain was eventually published in the journal &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01741-0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nature Neuroscience;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, featuring photos and breakdowns of all of my scans. We saw some noticeable changes to my brain over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One big standout was in the volume of gray matter in my brain. Gray matter is a type of tissue that’s mostly responsible for processing memory, along with sensory perception, speech and decision-making. The gray matter decreased about 4%, and those changes are pretty permanent. In tracking this, we could see a steady decrease and a slight bounce back in volume, but it never really fully returned. I haven’t noticed a change in how I think, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We also looked at white matter, which acts as the “superhighway” in the brain to form big connections. We think of this as the road information travels on. Here, we found an interesting change where the structural integrity of white matter improved and peaked around the second trimester before returning to baseline after my baby was born. Again, I didn’t notice a difference in how I thought or felt during this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="we-dont-really-know-what-this-means"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We don’t really know what this means&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The purpose of the study was to look for changes in the brain during pregnancy. It's 2025, and it’s shocking how little we know about some of these things. There were basically no studies on brain changes during pregnancy, so it was up to us to do the research. But we don’t know yet what these findings mean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We don’t know if these brain changes are good or not. There is some suggestion that these changes are adaptive, morphing the brain on purpose to help with maternal care. But it could also be a trade-off. The body may be saying, “We’ve got other things to do here. Sorry, brain!” and shuttling vital resources away from the brain to other areas. So, we really don’t know. Now, we need to find out what all of this means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;General interest in this area of research has opened up, and there’s been a very big response in the research community to our work. We’re now working with other people and plan to do another round with a bigger sample of 10 to 15 pregnant women. After that, we’ll scan hundreds of pregnant women but with fewer time points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I’m lucky that I had no major issues with postpartum depression, but estimates from the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.cdc.gov/reproductive-health/depression/index.html#:~:text=Depression%20rates%20during%20and%20after%20pregnancy&amp;amp;text=CDC%20research%20shows%20about%201,reported%20symptoms%20of%20postpartum%20depression." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; show that up to one in eight women do. We’re keeping an eye toward postpartum depression with our research and who is most vulnerable. The hope is that we can help to identify how the risks of postpartum depression change during pregnancy along with where, when and how we can help to prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ultimately, the big thing is that we actually did the study and asked the questions. This is a huge area of research that has been overlooked — and we’re actively trying to change that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 09:00:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi3gFBVV95cUxQa1dyX09IRkpCd3NRSk9wVy02Nzh6T1VqdDZNNUpvNktMTHJBMUZsRzN5YUxycy1mQW54eEFZaVpsNXhnWGlGcWltRGpXX21pV3JoRk9nbEdhdmRwT1UtSjd5T1ByRlNQVDh1WDVsQi00SFZrV05BRE1ZUTNwcjduYXY5U0NOZnZnaUxaZTRvMGxnWWlMQ2xMcTN0dW53RmRYaXZ1a3VBZThwVEhTTm5wam5zUU5LTGN6R1d0RkFsVHF0aUFLRmtxOEU2QlpZRjZTQ2JQSG8tYkFScE5LOFE</guid></item><item><title>由营养师创建的7天无糖高蛋白抗炎膳食计划- AOL.com | 7-Day No-Sugar High-Protein Anti-Inflammatory Meal Plan, Created by a Dietitian - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZEFVX3lxTE9MSlE3U005YjlWUmxwd1VKM280b000VGVzY1V4djkyU1hsX0txd3hiQ3dhLUhoVThxQVFKbjBYbHYteWhxdXE1bXNQcnREa0V5S2xLaHFCZzhZRkRmTnpaMk9mWWE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reviewed by Dietitian Jessica Ball, M.S., RD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recipe photos: Brie Passano and Jen Causey.

This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels. For more inspiration, check out these delicious &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/easy-anti-inflammatory-dinner-recipes-11756624" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anti-inflammatory recipes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;anti-inflammatory recipes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 318 to 335 calories, while the lunches span 341 to 414 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the difference between natural and added sugars?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural sugars are found in fruits, vegetables and dairy. Added sugars are any type of sugar, even "natural" ones like honey and maple syrup, that are added during food processing. Unlike added sugars, which are added purely for sweetness and have little nutritional value, natural sugars are found in foods that provide beneficial nutrients, like fiber, protein, vitamins and minerals. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/67340/how-to-cut-back-on-sneaky-added-sugars/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Added sugars;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Added sugars&lt;/a&gt; in our diets can add up because they're often found in foods we wouldn't necessarily expect, like sauces, marinades, cereals and flavored yogurts. It is recommended that you limit added sugars in the diet to no more than 25 grams per day for women and 36 grams per day for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Health Benefits of an Anti-Inflammatory Diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An anti-inflammatory diet is one that includes foods that fight inflammation in the body. These are foods that contain antioxidants, like beta-carotene and anthocyanins, foods containing omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon and walnuts, and foods that promote a healthy microbiome, such as probiotics, prebiotics and dietary fiber. Chronic inflammation is a contributor to the onset and progression of many chronic conditions, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer and obesity. Choosing foods that help to reduce inflammation in the body can help prevent and manage chronic conditions. In addition, excess intake of added sugars can lead to increased risk of chronic low-grade inflammation, so opt for foods with naturally occurring sugars that are also paired with inflammation-fighting nutrients, like colorful fruits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How We Create Meal Plans&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registered dietitians thoughtfully create &lt;em&gt;EatingWell’s&lt;/em&gt; meal plans to be easy-to-follow and delicious. Each meal plan meets specific parameters depending on the health condition and/or lifestyle goal it is targeting and is analyzed for accuracy using the nutrition database, ESHA Food Processor. As nutritional needs differ from person to person, we encourage you to use these plans as inspiration and adjust as you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-no-sugar-high-protein-anti-inflammatory-meal-plan-11757370" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 08:34:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZEFVX3lxTE9MSlE3U005YjlWUmxwd1VKM280b000VGVzY1V4djkyU1hsX0txd3hiQ3dhLUhoVThxQVFKbjBYbHYteWhxdXE1bXNQcnREa0V5S2xLaHFCZzhZRkRmTnpaMk9mWWE</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.的新疫苗顾问预示着即将到来的重大变化：短波疫苗- NPR | RFK Jr.'s new vaccine advisors signal big changes to come : Short Wave - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxPUW9HQmNveUcxZFdOV2RTc2wyYmtDOTJnR21pTXdaRDdzNUlNalVjaXlFTTRwaENodFR5d3BIX0xwbVNZcGtOU2xxX3ZUS19wSV83eW40RXFYTWF3ZFhISTAxMmZpWlN5MGd3MlFWXzBnenRqUzEwTmhKektQbzFQcFZDcENkeHlTYUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted on the flu vaccine, raising concerns about a rarely used preservative. Medical groups worry this will "sow distrust" in vaccines.

   &lt;p&gt;The Advisory Committee on Immunization Policy, an influential CDC committee that shapes U.S. vaccine policy, has become a flashpoint in recent weeks. Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired all 17 members and replaced them with 7 new members — many of whom do not have deep expertise in vaccines, and some of whom have spread vaccine misinformation. NPR public health correspondent &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/people/729920828/pien-huang"&gt;Pien Huang&lt;/a&gt; was at the new working group's first meeting last week. This episode, she talks with &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/people/767284140/emily-kwong"&gt;Emily&lt;/a&gt; about the sweeping changes they promised to how vaccine policy is made in the U.S. — and resurrected issues that have been advanced by groups that question vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;

General Surgery and Emergency Medicine, Dr Vass, who frequently shares on his Instagram valuable insights on how to improve health, recently, on June 29, posted about the essential habits that help to improve heart health, reducing the risks of heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=""&gt; &lt;span class=""&gt; &lt;picture&gt; &lt;source media="(max-width:767px)" srcset="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/06/30/550x309/heart_attack_1751259573007_1751259573197.jpg" alt="Symptoms can be mild or vague, making it difficult to recognise a silent heart attack.(Freepik)" title="Symptoms can be mild or vague, making it difficult to recognise a silent heart attack.(Freepik)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/06/30/550x309/heart_attack_1751259573007_1751259573197.jpg" alt="Symptoms can be mild or vague, making it difficult to recognise a silent heart attack.(Freepik)" title="Symptoms can be mild or vague, making it difficult to recognise a silent heart attack.(Freepik)"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Symptoms can be mild or vague, making it difficult to recognise a silent heart attack.(Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p id="readMoreFTUser"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Walking after meals to reduce blood sugar and inflammation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/10/05/550x309/walking_indoors_1728104308266_1728104308536.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Avoid sitting after a meal and briefly stroll.(Shutterstock)" title="Avoid sitting after a meal and briefly stroll.(Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Avoid sitting after a meal and briefly stroll.(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;A simple walk, even as gentle as a stroll, can evoke meaningful results for heart health. He said, “Even walking for just 10 minutes after a meal can help lower that postprandial blood sugar spike, which can significantly reduce inflammation, which are two major risk factors for plaque buildup in arteries.” The plaque buildup in the artery is one of the main causes behind heart attack, blocking blood flow to the heart."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Consume Omega-3&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/05/08/original/AdobeStock_254247345_1746692407716.jpeg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Fish types like salmond contain omega-3 fatty acids. (Adobe Stock)" title="Fish types like salmond contain omega-3 fatty acids. (Adobe Stock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Fish types like salmond contain omega-3 fatty acids. (Adobe Stock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Certain nutrients strengthen your heart health. Omega-3 is one of them, and the doctor urged adding them to the diet. Dr Vass explained, “Prioritise omega 3 intake. Wild cod fish, like salmon or a high-quality omega 3 supplement, can help to lower triglyceride levels, lower intravascular inflammation and reduce arterial stiffness.” Omega-3 falls in the category of healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Sleep like your life depends on it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/05/05/550x309/sleep_1746440250631_1746440250877.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Sleep well to stay healthy.(Shutterstock)" title="Sleep well to stay healthy.(Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Sleep well to stay healthy.(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sleep is one of the pillars of good health, acting as the very foundation because many physiological functions rejuvenate during rest. The doctor connected this to heart attack and said, “Sleep like your life depends on it, because it does. Sleeping less than six hours a night can increase heart attack risk by up to two hundred per cent. Prioritise your sleep, aim for consistency and eight quality hours a night.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Swap plastic for glass&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastics are pervasive, available everywhere for several different utilities, in shapes, sizes and forms. But this is a big health hazard, big enough to stop your heart, too. Dr Vass elaborated, “Plastic leak chemicals like phthalates, which disrupt hormones, drive inflammation, and over time can help to push into the arteries. Store food in glass, filter your water and never heat anything in plastic.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Get the right tests done &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular checks help keep your heart healthy. While a cholesterol test is one way to track heart health, there are several other tests as well that can help with early warning. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said, “Track the right labs. Don't just check LDL. Get your protein B, lipoprotein little A, homocysteine and high sensitivity CRP checked on a regular basis. These can help you show your real heart attack risk, years before any symptoms show up.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

A man in his 40s developed not one but 35 kidney stones after drinking nearly 3 litres of Coca-Cola every day for several years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors concluded that the high sugar and phosphoric acid content in the soda contributed to the condition. This may have reportedly disturbed the body and ultimately led to kidney stones.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="d-block d-md-none" id="single-content-ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="cross-article" href="https://www.m9.news/social-media-viral/hyderabad-couple-arrested-for-shocking-adult-scam/?utm_source=cross-artice"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Also Read – &lt;/span&gt;Hyderabad Couple Arrested for Shocking Adult Scam!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patient eventually required surgical intervention to remove the stones. Who would have known that such prolonged and excessive intake of sugary carbonated beverages could lead to dangerous consequences!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health experts often warn that consuming high-sugar beverages, especially in large quantities, can disrupt the body’s mineral balance. This, in turn, may lead to the formation of bladder or kidney stones.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="cross-article" href="https://www.m9.news/social-media-viral/sudden-death-young-cricketer-from-firozpur-dies-after-hitting-six/?utm_source=cross-artice"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Also Read – &lt;/span&gt;Viral Video: Young Cricketer Collapse, Dies on Spot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1128098037951047" data-ad-slot="2205812468" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how many of us actually listen to these warning signs? It’s not a joke to remove over 30+ kidney stones. The pain, the risks, and the surgery involved are a harsh reminder that our daily habits!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some gut health supplements lack research and may do more harm than good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experts recommend food first: fiber, fermented foods and variety support your microbiome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always talk to a health care professional before trying OTC enzymes or antacids.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Gut health isn’t just about good digestion. A healthy gut microbiome—the colony of bacteria and other microorganisms living in your intestines—is also important for immune health, heart health, brain health and more. The &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;foods you eat&lt;/a&gt; can significantly impact the makeup of your gut microbiota, for better or worse. But what role do supplements play in gut health? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many supplements promise to heal your gut, but research does not support many of these claims. We spoke to nutrition experts to find out what you should and shouldn’t do for gut health. Registered dietitians encourage a food-first approach instead of relying on expensive, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-supplement-8645052" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;unregulated supplements&lt;/a&gt;. Read on to see which ones they say to skip.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Probiotic supplements often claim to improve health by restoring healthy gut bacteria and some research suggests they may help reduce the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “For probiotics to be effective, you need to take the right strain at the right dose for your condition. Probiotics may worsen symptoms in many people with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO),” says &lt;a href="http://www.goodgutnutritionist.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kerry Conlon, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to &lt;a href="https://dietitianinsights.com/dietitians/kelsey-costa-ms-rdn" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kelsey Costa, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, most people can “cultivate a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;healthy gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; by engaging in regular exercise and consuming a diet rich in whole, minimally processed foods.” Since they are supplements, the Food and Drug Administration does not regulate probiotics. Over-the-counter probiotics available in pharmacies and stores may not be high quality, and it’s even possible that some products may not contain the probiotic bacteria listed on the label.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-greens-powders"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Greens Powders &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many greens powders claim to improve gut and overall health; however, there isn’t much research to back up these claims. One thing most &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8036275/greens-powder-benefits/#toc-what-are-greens-powders-and-are-they-healthy" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;greens powders&lt;/a&gt; don’t provide is dietary fiber. Conlon says, “Relying on powders for nutrients instead of whole fruits and vegetables deprives your body of fiber, an essential nutrient for gut health.” Fiber feeds beneficial gut bacteria and promotes digestion and nutrient absorption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Over-the-counter digestive enzymes are often thought to relieve acid reflux, gas and bloating. The market for these products is substantial, but it's not known if they are safe or effective since they are unregulated by the FDA and limited research is available.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The body naturally produces digestive enzymes to help break down food. “Most people don’t need to supplement with digestive enzymes unless they have certain medical conditions, like cystic fibrosis or liver problems,” explains &lt;a href="https://amandasauceda.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Amanda Sauceda, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to Costa, “The precise ingredients, dosage and potency of digestive enzyme products could vary significantly without any guaranteed outcomes or firm understanding of potential side effects.” Costa recommends talking to your health care provider before taking OTC digestive enzymes. Even then, take only the specific enzyme supplements directed by your health care provider and watch for potential side effects.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Antacids—an OTC remedy for treating heartburn, acid reflux and indigestion—work by neutralizing stomach acid, providing quick relief from discomfort. “While antacids are technically medications and not supplements, they are widely available OTC and are overused by many,” says Costa.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research suggests that proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs)—a commonly used type of antacid—may significantly change the makeup of the gut microbiome. This may result in an overgrowth of harmful gut bacteria, changes in nutrient absorption and inappropriate immune responses.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; PPIs should only be used as needed, as directed by a health care provider.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to a recent review from &lt;em&gt;Gut Microbes&lt;/em&gt;, polyphenols and probiotics found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8021156/foods-to-improve-gut-health-overnight/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support gut health&lt;/a&gt; and the growth of good gut bacteria.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For a healthy gut, focus on consuming a variety of plant-based foods while limiting foods high in added sugar and saturated fat. On your next shopping trip, Sauceda suggests picking up a fruit, veggie or grain you haven’t had in a while.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Aim to consume at least 25 grams of fiber daily and eat lots of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/281916/must-eat-fermented-foods-for-a-healthy-gut/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fermented foods&lt;/a&gt;, like kefir, sauerkraut and kombucha. Fermented foods naturally contain probiotics that support gut health, while fiber feeds beneficial gut bacteria. Add a fruit, vegetable or whole grain to each meal and snack to help you hit your fiber goal.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Gut health is best achieved through a healthy lifestyle including eating a balanced and variety-filled diet, regularly exercising, getting enough quality sleep and managing stress in a healthy way. Instead of spending money on expensive supplements that might not be effective, eat a balanced diet that is high in fiber and low in added sugars and saturated fats. Focus on including a variety of plant-based and fermented foods.

One of the most common types is metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Linked to poor diet, obesity, and sedentary lifestyle, this condition can lead to liver inflammation, scarring, and even cirrhosis if left untreated. Dr. Wendi LeBrett, a double-board-certified gastroenterologist and internal medicine physician based in California, has now shared an exercise that can help prevent and even improve fatty liver disease. Before we dive into that, let’s take a look at fatty liver disease and its symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is fatty liver? &lt;br&gt;    &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The liver is the largest organ in the body, which helps the body to digest food, store energy, and remove toxins. Fatty liver disease is a condition where excess fat accumulates in the liver, impairing its function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two main types:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), aka Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alcoholic fatty liver disease, also called alcoholic steatohepatitis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms of fatty liver disease &lt;br&gt;    &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty liver is often called a ‘silent’ disease because it may present no symptoms in its early stages. You probably will not know you have it, unless it's diagnosed during tests carried out for another reason. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the disease progresses, the following symptoms may appear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a dull or aching pain in the top right of the tummy (over the lower right side of the ribs)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;unexplained weight loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;weakness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the best &lt;keyword id="25736333" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="exercise-for-fatty-liver" source="keywords"&gt;exercise for fatty liver&lt;/keyword&gt; disease &lt;br&gt;    &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dr. LeBrett has emphasized the importance of incorporating exercise into one's routine to improve and prevent certain conditions. “One in four Americans will have fatty liver, and insulin resistance is a key driver in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver,” the gastroenterologist said in a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLd9p0aR_TQ/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; shared on Instagram. She also emphasized the importance of controlling insulin resistance through exercise. “Building muscle mass is one of the best ways to reduce insulin resistance and should be the priority at the gym with anyone with or at risk of fatty liver,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people think of exercise, especially as weight gain and obesity are linked to fatty liver disease, they jump on cardio. While cardio is beneficial in losing weight, the doctor emphasizes that building muscles is even more important. For that, she recommends weight-bearing exercises. “Prioritizing weight-bearing exercise over cardio at the gym because increasing muscle mass is one of the best ways to prevent and improve fatty liver,” the doctor suggested. These exercises include walking, running, jumping, dancing, and using weights or resistance bands to perform exercises like squats, lunges, and push-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Matthew Perry Death Case: Doctor Mark Chavez Pleads Guilty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with exercise, making some lifestyle changes, such as focusing on a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/diet/harvard-liver-specialist-suggests-consuming-4-snacks-weekly-to-reverse-fatty-liver/photostory/121932934.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;balanced diet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, can also help to improve and even reverse fatty liver disease. A balanced diet low in refined sugars and processed carbohydrates is ideal. Regular monitoring by a healthcare provider is essential to track progress and prevent complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi7wFBVV95cUxQY0lYZUVNQWJfaUFxR2FUanFZd1o2cjNETUdUZ1VKZHBsM3o1ZEJjczVnblNBSUFkMWg0UXdJX2taWG5tMzZBSVQ0cW9ueHUxbk51WWhULTlSRFdmLS01UE1SQWMyNVdZNDFkUTU4Z054TmxFR2dBUmtZLTlqTURQcG5EY0xaS0tTX1pHZV9xWmdBZm5zNWhmZDJXOE1KRlJ4dVJXcm1XRlVDTVlHYkw1aDZmNUoxV25xSGdfOTNUdk5rRkpFUlpsRkpDclBOYi12Uk9xUmRtVzMwSEI4MXNfR2FkYXlKZzM3NEtvYlNjQQ</guid></item><item><title>根据胃肠病学家的说法，对肠道健康有益的最佳水果- EatingWell | The Best Fruit for Your Gut Health, According to a Gastroenterologist - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTFBLU3FZRUhmbVViU051VGx0aS1fM004UkR5b0swRDhheF9zZ3dSV1AtZmQ2UGJ0UWZQLWM4ZzFKckh5RXR1Yk80UDJOR182d3Nlb0VGdXJ4cS15YXY4VmExaHhFaUdkSk5SX2VtOWxMbmNaaXlH?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most adults don’t consume enough fiber, but incorporating fiber-rich foods like raspberries can be an easy and delicious solution. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Raspberries are not only packed with fiber, but are also packed with vitamin C and antioxidants. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low in FODMAPs, raspberries are gentle on sensitive stomachs, making them a perfect option for those with IBS or digestive issues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although we're supposed to shoot for 25 to 38 grams of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-much-fiber-should-you-be-eating-11752876" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; per day, more than 90% of women and 97% of men are not meeting this recommendation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And while it might seem more pressing to keep an eye on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290496/this-is-how-much-protein-you-need-to-eat-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;how much protein&lt;/a&gt; you're eating—or whatever appears to be the "hot" macronutrient of the moment—making an effort to eat enough fiber is never going out of style. This is because &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;evidence suggests eating enough fiber&lt;/a&gt; can benefit several areas of our health—including gut health, digestion, bone strength, weight, risk for several chronic diseases and even longevity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We're not talking about suffering through glasses of water mixed with a chalky fiber supplement, though.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the most potent sources of fiber is a sweet, versatile, tasty fruit that's an &lt;em&gt;EatingWell &lt;/em&gt;editor favorite. It turns out that the same fruit is also a gut-health doctor-recommended option and might be the all-around best fruit for gut health, according to a February 8, 2023, Instagram reel from &lt;a href="https://theplantfedgut.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Will Bulsiewicz, M.D&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed mntl-sc-block-embed--instagram"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So what is the best fruit for gut health? Raspberries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "I'm a huge fan of raspberries … First off, they're friggin' delicious," Bulsiewicz shares in the caption. "I mean, seriously. They are like candy, how are they so healthy? But they are!" In the reel, Bulsiewicz continues, "They're super high in fiber. A cup of raspberries has about 7 g of fiber—that's like half of what the average American is getting per day."&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bulsiewicz goes on to share more about the many &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7835832/health-benefits-of-raspberries/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;health benefits of raspberries&lt;/a&gt;, including them being rich in nutrients like "vitamin C and polyphenol antioxidants … that are incredibly good for us," he adds. "Believe it or not, even though there's sugar in berries, berries have been shown to reduce our likelihood of developing [type 2] diabetes. And if you have [type 2] diabetes, they can help you to ultimately reverse it."&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lastly, Bulsiewicz loves that raspberries are high in fiber and low in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291572/what-to-eat-if-you-have-ibs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;FODMAPs&lt;/a&gt;—fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols. While many of these specific types of carbs are beneficial for people with healthy guts, they have been shown to exacerbate symptoms among those who have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "In other words, if you have digestive issues and are rebuilding your gut, you should be enjoying raspberries," concludes Bulsiewicz. Thankfully, there are many ways you can do just that. The doctor adores raspberry toasts, raspberry salads, raspberry spritzers and raspberry smoothies. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating raspberries has several benefits, including &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7871141/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-don-t-eat-enough-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;adding to your fiber quota&lt;/a&gt;, promoting healthy digestion (even if you struggle with IBS), consuming more vitamins, minerals and polyphenols, and more. But keep in mind that raspberries shouldn't be your only source of fiber. One of the top five things you should do every day to improve your gut and overall health, says Bulsiewicz, is to eat a wide variety of plants, whole grains, healthy fats and protein.&lt;br&gt;

Here the study team, led by researchers from Tufts University, wanted to look specifically at whether what you add to your coffee makes a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Few studies have examined how coffee additives could impact the link between coffee consumption and mortality risk, and our study is among the first to quantify how much sweetener and saturated fat are being added," &lt;a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2025/06/16/hold-cream-and-sugar-black-coffee-linked-lower-risk-death"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist Bingjie Zhou from Tufts University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our results align with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans which recommend limiting added sugar and saturated fat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coffee-could-be-the-secret-to-healthy-aging-for-women-scientists-discover?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Coffee Could Be The Secret to Healthy Aging For Women, Scientists Discover&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team crunched the stats on 46,332 US adults aged 20 or over, recorded in government health surveys, over the course of 9-11 years on average. In that time, 7,074 people died – deaths which were then cross-referenced against &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-are-all-the-reasons-why-you-should-enjoy-your-cup-of-coffee"&gt;coffee consumption&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee drinkers showed a notably lower risk of all-cause mortality, the researchers found, but when more than a little sugar and saturated fat (as found in full-cream milk or cream) was added to the mix, that statistical significance went away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_165130" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165130" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/PouringMilk.jpg" alt="Pouring milk into coffee" class="wp-image-165130 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/PouringMilk.jpg 1600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/PouringMilk-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/PouringMilk-738x415.jpg 738w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/PouringMilk-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/PouringMilk-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/PouringMilk-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-165130" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Adding sugar and fat took away the benefits linked with coffee.

Between two or three cups a day seems to be the sweet spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the researchers did factor in variables that might have affected mortality rates – including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/boosting-exercise-intensity-reduces-mortality-risk-study-suggests"&gt;exercise levels&lt;/a&gt;, alcohol intake, age, sex, and education level – the study isn't thorough enough to prove direct cause and effect. There may still be unknown variables influencing both coffee drinking and all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the data here does show a strong association, and does fit in with previous research into &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-and-tea-each-day-could-be-protecting-your-heart"&gt;the health benefits of coffee&lt;/a&gt;. This study suggests that  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="165127" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; drives those benefits, as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-coffee-may-not-even-need-caffeine-to-wake-you-up"&gt;decaffeinated coffee&lt;/a&gt; drinkers saw no difference in mortality rates, and that sugar, milk, and cream might dilute the positive effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The health benefits of coffee might be attributable to its bioactive compounds, but our results suggest that the addition of sugar and saturated fat may reduce the mortality benefits," &lt;a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2025/06/16/hold-cream-and-sugar-black-coffee-linked-lower-risk-death"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Fang Fang Zhang from Tufts University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's plenty more still to look into here, not least how the many different components of coffee might be protecting against an early death. There are likely to be numerous factors involved – including when you actually drink the stuff, as shown by a study published &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/key-health-perks-of-coffee-depend-on-when-you-drink-it-suggests-study"&gt;at the start of the year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new research is particularly helpful in that it isolates the coffee itself from anything else we may throw into it, which isn't the case for all studies like this – with each study often focusing on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-may-lower-risk-of-death-from-too-much-sitting"&gt;an angle of its own&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Coffee is among the most-consumed beverages in the world, and with nearly half of American adults reporting drinking at least one cup per day, it's important for us to know what it might mean for health," &lt;a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2025/06/16/hold-cream-and-sugar-black-coffee-linked-lower-risk-death"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Zhang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjnut.2025.05.004"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Journal of Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

However, overall heart disease death rates over the past five decades dropped by 66% in American adults ages 25 and older, according to a new study. Even better, deaths from heart attacks dropped by nearly 90%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over the past 50 years, our understanding of heart disease, what causes it and how we treat it has evolved considerably," said lead study author Dr. Sara King, a second-year internal medicine resident at Stanford University School of Medicine in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There have been great strides made in helping people survive initial acute cardiac events that were once considered a death sentence," King said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that positive news has a flip side. Deaths from all other types of heart disease, including arrhythmia, heart failure and hypertensive heart disease, increased by 81% in the United States, according to the study published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to put both sets of numbers into perspective, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These days, the likelihood of dying from a heart attack is relatively low compared to where it's been, but the likelihood of significant disability from the heart attack is still high," said Freeman, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You might develop heart failure — where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs and you're always short of breath," he said. "Or maybe you're on a number of medications for blood pressure, fluid retention and cholesterol, or you never feel your best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's one thing to be alive; it's another to be alive and well," Freeman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cardiovascular risks on the rise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study analyzed government data on deaths from heart disease between 1970 and 2022. Back in 1970, heart attacks were responsible for 54% of all deaths from heart issues. By 2022 that number had dropped to 29%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deaths from atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias, which happen when electrical impulses to the heart go awry and cause an irregular heartbeat or "flutter" in the chest, were rare in the 1970s. By 2022, the number had risen to 450% — about 4% of all heart disease deaths, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deaths from heart failure increased 146% over the same time period, while death due to persistent high blood pressure rose by 106%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in cardiovascular risk factors are contributing to the rise in certain types of heart disease, the study said. Obesity, Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, poor food choices and physical inactivity have skyrocketed over the past 50 years. Obesity prevalence rose from 15% in 1970 to 40% in 2022, the study found. Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes now impacts nearly half of all adults in the United States. High blood pressure increased from 30% in 1978 to nearly 50% in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another potential contributor — the aging baby boomer population now reaching a time when they are most likely to develop heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All of these risk factors contribute to an ongoing burden of heart disease, especially as related to heart failure, hypertensive heart disease and arrhythmias," said senior study author Dr. Latha Palaniappan, professor of cardiovascular medicine and associate dean for research at Stanford University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Heart disease hasn't gone away," Palaniappan said in a statement. "The focus now must be on helping people age with strong, healthy hearts by preventing events, and prevention can start as early as childhood."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

The fertilised eggs were then transferred to the intended mothers, who had an average age of 43.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were divided into two groups – men aged 45 or younger and those over 45, and while fertilisation rates and embryo development were similar between the groups, differences emerged in the outcomes of the pregnancies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Miscarriage rates – where the baby is lost before 24 weeks – were notably higher among couples where the male partner was over 45, reaching 23.8 per cent compared with 16.3 per cent in the younger paternal age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;IVF involving men over the age of 45 is linked to increased miscarriage risks, a study has revealed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Live birth rates were also lower in the older paternal age group, at 35.1 per cent versus 41 per cent for men aged 45 or younger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Discussing the findings, Dr Maria Cristina Guglielmo, an embryologist at the fertility clinic Eugin Italy, said: ‘Traditionally, maternal age has been the central focus in reproductive medicine, but our results show that the age of the male partner also plays a crucial and independent role.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained that as men age, the continuous division of sperm stem cells increases the chance of DNA replication errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In turn, this can impair embryo development and contribute to a higher risk of miscarriage, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Guglielmo added: ‘Our findings underscore the need for fertility clinics to adopt a more balanced approach that recognises the role of paternal age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Clinics should ensure male patients are informed about how advancing paternal age can impact fertility potential, pregnancy success and miscarriage risk.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;According to health news platform &lt;em&gt;Eating Well&lt;/em&gt;, your kidneys are some of the hardest-working organs in your body, filtering waste from your blood, regulating fluid balance, and even producing hormones necessary for bone health and red blood cell production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Though your kidneys naturally do a great job of maintaining balance, adding kidney-friendly foods to your diet can help support their function. Here are five foods recommended by dietitians to keep your kidneys healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Dark leafy greens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;According to dietitian Catalina Ruz Gatica, leafy greens such as spinach, kale, and collard greens are packed with vitamins C, E, and K, along with key minerals like calcium, magnesium, potassium, and iron. They help fight inflammation and protect against oxidative damage, which can occur when kidneys are under stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Tart cherries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Tart cherries are high in vitamin A and antioxidants, which help lower blood pressure. Since high blood pressure is a leading cause of kidney damage, including tart cherries in your diet can help maintain healthy blood pressure and &lt;a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/life/wellness/5-protein-consumption-mistakes-that-can-harm-your-kidneys-4905348.html" rel="dofollow"&gt;support kidney health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Tofu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tplCaption" data-widget="obj"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img alt="Tofu served in a white and blue ceramic bowl.

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Tofu, a plant-based protein, is a great alternative to meat, particularly when trying to reduce the strain on your kidneys. Animal proteins can create an acidic environment in the body, which may overwhelm kidneys, especially if they are already under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Additionally, the &lt;em&gt;U.S. National Kidney Foundation&lt;/em&gt; recommends tofu for kidney-friendly diets due to its low levels of phosphorus, potassium, and sodium. While tofu does not require you to eliminate meat, incorporating plant proteins can be highly beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Flaxseed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Flaxseeds are an excellent source of fiber, which helps maintain stable blood sugar levels. Since uncontrolled blood sugar can damage the kidneys over time, incorporating flaxseeds into your diet can support kidney health by helping to regulate glucose levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Garlic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Garlic is a powerful anti-inflammatory that has been shown to help reduce blood pressure, which is &lt;a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/life/wellness/9-best-herbs-for-liver-health-4894207.html" rel="dofollow"&gt;beneficial for kidney function&lt;/a&gt;. Garlic also helps protect against oxidative damage, which can further harm kidneys, particularly in individuals with kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="true" data-component-type="tin_xemthem" data-component-value="4905348,4897829,4897201,4896701,4896186" data-thumb="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

She glared at me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“What’s it got to do with you?” she asked. “Since you stopped cooking for us, I think I can eat whatever I want.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. Ever since I went on the weight-loss drug Mounjaro — and consequently lost my appetite and three stone in weight — I have essentially stopped cooking. My daughter’s alleged fondness for cheese strings is, I suspect, a deliberate act designed to rile me. For now I no longer&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; cook and the three children I live with are decidedly not happy about it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;As they are aged 22, 21 and 18, it’s not that they can’t cook. They’re perfectly capable of cooking for themselves and I very much doubt my daughter is going to eat a cheese string ever. It’s just that they have been brought up on organic this and foraged that. For most of their lives I have banged on about how we are what we eat and the importance of a varied diet and gut health. So much so I think they’d probably come out in an allergic reaction if they ate even a slice of pizza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;My daughter is just making a point, and in many ways it’s a valid one. The way weight-loss drugs work is that they affect the hormone in your brain that tells you to eat. And I love eating. But I’ve been on Mounjaro for eight months and it’s not only affected my body and how I feel about it, but also everyone around me, especially my children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;I have always been known as someone who likes to cook. It has been something I’ve been incredibly proud of. I didn’t grow up in a particularly food-orientated household. I certainly didn’t cook at university or in my twenties, when I lived on Pot Noodles and soya puddings. But as I grew older and our national interest in food grew, I began to find food and cooking and eating far more interesting and nuanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="4.4"&gt;&lt;div id="125ba036-675f-49b6-83a4-f7af60d15380"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Lucy Cavendish before Mounjaro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GEMMA DAY FOR THE TIMES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In my thirties I was the launch editor of Observer Food Monthly and after that my obsession with food and cooking grew and grew. I met so many chefs, from Gordon Ramsay and Angela Hartnett to Marcus Wareing and Rick Stein. I went on many cooking courses at Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall’s cookery school in Dorset. I went out fishing and learnt how to gut and cook mackerel on an open fire. I made pizza dough from scratch. I rolled out pasta. I went to Italy and learnt how to cook focaccia. In Spain I ate boar in a dark bitter chocolate sauce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Over the years, it’s not just been about the cooking and the food and the taste, it’s been about who I am. So it’s also become part of my children’s lives and part of our identity as a family. We are the family that still had a Sunday roast complete with cauliflower cheese, homemade roast potatoes, Yorkshire puddings, the works. Even as my children have got older, I’ve produced risottos and baked monkfish with pancetta. They would come back in from work or studying and there would be a delicious meal ready and waiting. It’s always felt like an offering of love that I have wanted to give them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;That was until I went on Mounjaro and, of course, life changed. It’s very hard to cook for people when you have absolutely no appetite. Every time I look in the fridge, I can’t see a single thing I want to eat. I go to the supermarket, the shops and the farmers’ market, and whereas in the past I was so inspired — buying forest mushrooms and fruit just picked from the trees — I now can’t think of a single thing I want to buy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;I’ll pick up delicious ripe apples and think, hmm … all those lovely fresh fish waiting to be grilled with lemon and butter and salt and pepper? Not one bit of me wants to eat it. I know we need to have food in the fridge but even red pepper hummus, a former favourite, leaves me feeling slightly queasy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/mounjaro-weight-loss-injection-nhs-l0g0pg3dc" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mounjaro weight-loss injections now available in UK through NHS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Then, given that I have no appetite, I don’t find cooking interesting any more. Food has become completely dull and I have begun to wonder why I’d liked it in the first place. It’s extraordinary. I used to spend all day thinking about what to buy and what to cook and how much everyone would love it and how much I would love it, and now I can’t even get a flatbread down me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If I were living on my own, that would be fine. I would have virtually nothing in my fridge except a bit of smoked salmon and some vegetables and fruit. But I’m still living with three out of my four children and there has always been this coming together as a family to eat delicious food prepared by me — it has always felt very bonding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;So they were rather taken aback when it got to the first Sunday of my weight-loss journey and no roast appeared. “Oh, are we having a roast today?” my daughter asked, because she loves a Sunday roast. I told her that I was on my weight-loss injections — I’ve been very honest about that — and that I no longer had any appetite. “But we’ve still got appetites,” she said, looking a little bit hurt. It occurred to me then that if I stopped cooking for them they could make an assumption that I didn’t love them any more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“It’s not that I don’t love you or care about you,” I told them. “It’s just that I no longer want to cook any food or buy any food or have anything to do with food.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/weight-loss-injections-jabs-pancreatitis-gv7hrssvt" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fears over weight-loss jabs after ten deaths from pancreatitis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;This statement went down like a lead balloon. They looked at me as if I had slapped them across their faces with a fish. “Things are going to have to change,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;At first it took a bit of time. There was lots of going to the fridge and staring in it as if food would suddenly appear by magic. I could see my son Leonard’s face fall with disappointment as he would stare at the sad salad wilting in the bottom of the fridge and some ancient soft cheese that was probably going a bit mouldy. My daughter then decided that she would buy some cookbooks and start cooking elaborate meals that essentially involved using every single saucepan and utensil in the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“If you won’t cook, I will have to cook,” she said, whirling a ladle above her head. When she got tired of that she obviously decided to go down the cheese string route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;My third son, Jerry, decided this was an opportunity for him to go on a protein-based diet so he now bulk-buys endless amounts of cheap chicken breasts and eggs. He seems to exist on nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/shane-watson-mounjaro-l7hk66t5f" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The nine things we’ll miss when we’re all hooked on Mounjaro&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Another effect of all this is that everyone eats separately, which is actually a sadness to me. My desire to lose weight and get healthy has had a detrimental effect on our family life. I look better and feel fitter but it’s as if I’ve moved into a completely different world. I’m still not really used to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;So we are all trying to get to know each other in a slightly different way. I’m not exactly sure how that will work out. At some point I will be off the weight-loss drugs and maybe I’ll go back to producing nonstop delicious meals. Until then, however, the kitchen is going to stink of eggs and the fridge will be full of cheese strings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxOOUtTR3ZRYnZKVmM4RGI5VXBZYS1CMmtQd2tNRkhZWnhfT0NERE04VElBUFJTV1R5bEJCb1ZtUU8xZG5lMTNYRjNCQ0hZb3lZWk1iODBLajNWUEtCNWcwekF6aXZDZEtSY1hqMmVGS2Rnb2lTRWl0NnRBbmw2aDUtaGNIb3IzcXpOcmNMQXNnMjZzSmVFX3hWV01fWXMxcnJtNFpRSmpHc0NqdzFsZDJoeTFIcmlTakU</guid></item><item><title>医生和护士正在揭示您不应忽视的“小”健康标志，这令人震惊- BuzzFeed | Doctors And Nurses Are Revealing The "Small" Health Signs You Should Never Ignore, And It's Shocking - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxPRTlHNVEwRnVac2dpVFVTOGdMTU9qd0RoV2FrbW1iWFM5Q0h1NkU0WW9YVVRacUEwZVAzdlpFZFh6cFllbVJhb09HUUFld3hjUmg1ZDVtdkJfQ3pHQUVSWl9qODdZZFVlMDg2TmNmdVVpQk1pQkJKYndINkZrOFdNWUpjNVgyNUtrWXV3MWhtWHR1Mk4wcVY1eQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

A huge wake-up call for my own health was seeing normal, successful people in their 40s to 60s who couldn't do more than one push-up or get up from a seated position on the floor, with chronic back pain, neck pain, obesity, and falling. I assumed you magically lose that strength once you're old and retired, but no! It's so important to consistently do some version of moderate cardio and strength training from childhood until past retirement age. Do not skip your 20s to 50s!"&lt;/span&gt;

Though the research has yet to be peer reviewed, the findings are interesting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the expert: Ashley Curtis, Ph.D., assistant professor and director of the Cognition, Aging, Sleep, and Health (CASH) Lab in the College of Nursing at the &lt;a href="https://health.usf.edu/nursing/faculty-staff/directory/ashleycurtis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:University of South Florida;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;University of South Florida&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/48/Supplement_1/A152/8135607?login=false" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sleep&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;followed 86,565 participants across the United Kingdom from the UK Biobank. The ages of the volunteers ranged from 43 to 79 years, with 57% of the study participants identifying as female and 43% identifying as male. Researchers evaluated participants’ daytime napping behaviors to determine a link between daytime naps and the risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What researchers found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers reviewed self-reported daytime napping behavior alongside data collected from participants via activity trackers over seven days. Their daytime sleep habits were logged, tracking nap duration, timing, and any variation from existing nap habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This data was cross-referenced against other factors, including chronotype (the time of day you prefer to sleep or when you’re the most alert or have the most energy), BMI (&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/a38256590/is-bmi-accurate/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:which is not always an accurate predictor of health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;which is not always an accurate predictor of health&lt;/a&gt;), demographics, comorbidities, nighttime sleep habits, smoking, and alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found a strong connection between nap patterns and long-term health risks, including longevity and mortality. Specifically, longer naps, increased individual variability in the lengths of daytime naps, and napping around noon and the early afternoon hours were associated with greater risk of mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings highlight the potential importance of considering napping behaviors in risk stratification of mortality in middle-to-older aged adults,” researchers concluded, noting the value of incorporating nap assessments into clinical and public health practices in promoting longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do certain nap patterns increase the risk of death?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Ashley Curtis, Ph.D., assistant professor and director of the Cognition, Aging, Sleep, and Health (CASH) Lab in the College of Nursing at the &lt;a href="https://health.usf.edu/nursing/faculty-staff/directory/ashleycurtis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:University of South Florida;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;University of South Florida &lt;/a&gt;explained that research suggests that shorter daytime naps (under 30 mins) can be associated with some health benefits for older adults, longer naps (60-plus mins) have been linked to increased risk of mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As shown in this study, “Greater likelihood of napping around noon appears to have a detrimental impact on mortality risk,” Curtis said. “Further, there is &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article-abstract/41/7/zsy087/4990845" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:emerging research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;emerging research&lt;/a&gt; showing that the variability in napping behavior over time in older adults, such as switching from short to long naps or vice versa, is also associated with increased all-cause mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why would napping be associated with death?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons why napping may be associated with greater risk of mortality, according to Curtis, who explains that longer daytime napping itself may be a sign of poor nighttime sleep and sleep disorders—such as &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/sleep-energy/a44211864/insomnia-linked-to-higher-risk-of-stroke-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insomnia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insomnia&lt;/a&gt; and obstructive &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/sleep-energy/a43933932/sleep-apnea-linked-to-increased-risk-of-alzheimers-disease-stroke-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sleep apnea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;—which “are known to be associated with worse health trajectories and increased mortality risk if left untreated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curtis explains that the fragmented sleep associated with both of these sleep disorders may disrupt circadian factors and affect daytime alertness, thus leading older adults to nap more easily during the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is also a reciprocal relationship between napping and worse health outcomes and mortality,” she continues, adding that certain nap patterns in older adults have long been associated with the increased chronic low-grade &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/inflammation/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; that plays a role in various other medical conditions linked to worse health outcomes and longevity, “such as &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a64255416/ultra-processed-foods-obesity-brain-changes-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:obesity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a62235177/endocrinologists-guide-to-diabetes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, stroke, hypertension, and osteoporosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s more than just the fact that napping may be an indicator of an increased risk for death, Curtis reiterates, but &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article-abstract/41/7/zsy087/4990845" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:changes in existing nap patterns;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;changes in existing nap patterns&lt;/a&gt; as well. “These metrics, in combination with worse nighttime sleep (such as shorter total sleep time), may predict worse mortality outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can the connection between napping and death be broken?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curtis &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs11357-024-01351-5&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fsleep-energy%2Fa65175910%2Fnegative-health-effects-of-taking-a-nap%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cites research;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;cites research&lt;/a&gt; showing that the mortality risk associated with longer daytime napping in older adults may be lowered by certain lifestyle factors such as physical activity. “That is, specifically meeting the recommended weekly dosage of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (150 minutes of moderate intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity) can weaken the association between napping and mortality risk,” she continues. “Such physical activities for older adults could include fast walking or jogging, dancing, swimming, or hiking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curtis adds that the relationship between napping and mortality may be more nuanced in older adults and depend on sex differences in the prevalence of sleep disorders. “At least &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22951185/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; has shown that in older men, those who slept less than six hours and napped more than 30 minutes during the day had a higher risk of mortality,” she explains, noting that the same pattern wasn’t found in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Curtis says that when compared to older women, older men have higher rates of frequent nighttime urination and obstructive sleep apnea, both of which are linked to greater daytime sleepiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The longer napping and increased mortality relationship findings in older adults are largely consistent. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this relationship have not been fully determined,” Curtis says. “The napping and mortality relationship is complex and may be influenced by adverse or protective lifestyle factors (e.g., nutrition, physical activity, substance use), nighttime sleep patterns, and underlying sleep disorders, medical comorbidities, age, as well as sex and gender-related factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While more research is needed in this area, this study offers hope in identifying some early predictors of increased mortality and new clinical approaches for promoting longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 19:28:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFBsNGEyOFRETk9uYU5XaFNKMTZ4T1NRdGY1ZDhSRVFldDJ2QUMtY1p4aFF3ZjZSZjBGbmVrZzVSYkdmN0JGemx6d0lVRENyWldDeHNmdm93OGhweDRCMndLYlY4UkJfUlBmaVNnR2h5RDZhTzVOMFNEbTN6TEIwUQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
