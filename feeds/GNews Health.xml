Genetic variation can also predict how well a person will respond to different weight loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e16a07" class="body-graf"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03827-z" target="_blank"&gt;study published Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Nature Medicine, more than 600 researchers from around the world worked together to compile genetic data from more than 5 million people — the largest and most diverse genetic dataset to date. They also used genetic data from 23andMe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-53e505" class="body-graf"&gt;From the dataset, the researchers were able to create what’s known as a polygenic risk score, which takes into account which genetic variants a person has that have been linked to a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/obesity-wont-solely-defined-bmi-new-plan-global-experts-rcna187724" target="_blank"&gt;higher BMI in adulthood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0f1f6b" class="body-graf"&gt;The score, the researchers said, could be used to predict a person’s risk of obesity as an adult — before they even turn 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1afce6" class="body-graf"&gt;“Childhood is the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/new-guidelines-treating-childhood-obesity-include-medications-surgery-rcna64651" target="_blank"&gt;best time to intervene&lt;/a&gt;,” said study co-author Ruth Loos, a professor at the University of Copenhagen’s Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research. (Research conducted at the center is not influenced by drugmaker Novo Nordisk, though some of the study authors had ties to pharmaceutical companies that make weight loss drugs.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fa156c" class="body-graf"&gt;The findings come as obesity is rising around the world. Rates of obesity in adults have more than doubled globally since 1990, and adolescent rates have quadrupled, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight" target="_blank"&gt;according to the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. About 16% of adults worldwide have obesity and the situation is worse in the United States, where more than 40% of adults have obesity, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db508.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics&lt;/a&gt; show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-c37dc3" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twice as effective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6ae5e4" class="body-graf"&gt;The new test is not the first that predicts a person’s risk of obesity, but Loos and her team showed it was about twice as effective as the method doctors currently use to assess their patients. That &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)30290-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867419302909%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank"&gt;polygenetic score&lt;/a&gt; can account for about 8.5% of a person’s risk for having a high BMI as an adult. The new score increased that to about 17.6%, at least in people with European ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3a4ecd" class="body-graf"&gt;“That’s a pretty powerful risk indicator for obesity, but it still leaves open a lot that is unknown,” said Dr. Roy Kim, a pediatric endocrinologist at Cleveland Clinic Children’s who was not involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3dec93" class="body-graf"&gt;Based on this score, more than 80% of a person’s &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/brain-scans-show-different-factors-can-influence-obesity-men-women-rcna78340" target="_blank"&gt;risk for obesity can be explained by other factors&lt;/a&gt;, such as where they live, what kinds of foods they have access to, and how much they exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2f2207" class="body-graf"&gt;The test was not nearly as effective in predicting obesity risk in non-Europeans. It explained about 16% of the risk for having a high BMI in East Asian Americans, but just 2.2% in rural Ugandans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a9f9f1" class="body-graf"&gt;About 70% of people whose data was included in the study were of predominantly European ancestry. About 14% were Hispanic and typically had a mix of ancestries. About 8% were of predominantly East Asian descent and just under 5% were of predominantly African ancestry. These samples were predominantly from African American people, who largely had mixed ancestry. Just 1.5% were of predominantly South Asian ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d0b2f" class="body-graf"&gt;Loos said the new score is a big step forward, but that it’s still a prototype. The next step is to collect more — and more diverse — data on people with African ancestry in particular to improve how well the score works for everyone, not just white people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b48af5" class="body-graf"&gt;She said the score could offer one indicator — what &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/heart-health/new-blood-pressure-drug-helps-people-uncontrolled-hypertension-trial-rcna198443" target="_blank"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; is to heart disease, for example — that could help predict a person’s risk of developing obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-81ae7b" class="body-graf"&gt;“Obesity is not only about genetics, so genetics alone can never accurately predict obesity,” Loos said. “For the general obesity that we see all over the world, we need other factors such as lifestyle that need to be part of the predictions.” Genetics play a bigger role in severe obesity, meaning a BMI of more than 40, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6998b9" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, identifying a person’s genetic risk early on in childhood and intervening early with lifestyle coaching could make a big difference, she said. Research has shown that about 55% of children with obesity go on to have obesity in adolescence, and that about 80% of those individuals will have obesity in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5b14e1" class="body-graf"&gt;“Behavioral things are really important,” Kim said. “Their environment, their access to healthy food, exercise opportunities, even their knowledge about healthy foods all affect a person’s obesity risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-43f7a3" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How important are genetics, really?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-da5b10" class="body-graf"&gt;Although studies in identical twins have found that genetics can account for as much as 80% of the reason a person has obesity, lifestyle factors still play a huge role, Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-411973" class="body-graf"&gt;“Even with the same genetic makeup, people can have different body types,” he said. “From a very young age in my practice, we educate patients about the importance of eating protein-rich foods, a lot of fruits and vegetables and not too many refined carbs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3635fb" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Juliana Simonetti, co-director of the Comprehensive Weight Management Program at the University of Utah, has been using genetic testing in her adult patients for about five years. She said understanding a person’s genes can help doctors better treat weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f62664" class="body-graf"&gt;“Obesity is not homogeneous. We have different kinds and different presentations,” said Simonetti, who wasn’t involved with the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a5012c" class="body-graf"&gt;Simonetti uses a person’s genes to determine if a patient struggles with satiety, or feeling full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bce1e7" class="body-graf"&gt;“They eat but do not feel full,” Simonetti said, adding that this is a disorder caused by genetic mutations affecting certain pathways in the body. People who have these mutations “tend to have higher weight,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7fc797" class="body-graf"&gt;But such mutations do not tell the whole genetic story of obesity, Simonetti said. The genes that a person inherits from either parent, even if they are not mutations, also determine how a person’s body stores weight or uses energy. Both can play a big role in obesity risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d9cb3" class="body-graf"&gt;Genetic testing is also starting to be able to determine how well certain weight loss drugs will work for a person, Simonetti said, but she added this is just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3b002c" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“We are talking about three out of 80 mutations that we can treat,” she said. “We are getting better, and the more data we have, I’m hopeful that we are going to do a better job in being more precise in understanding treatment responses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 09:00:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxNaDh0RTcya1NFOUg5eW93bGZ6bEtXRTZsNVFnLVhvVElsY3E1ZkY3b050RzJ4bDdTR1ZidDc5M2ljY0h6ZnhVbDJ4WDJpYUJMV1VyOHI2NDN5d1dHSUxJQ0trcFQ4RlU4bmJyVmJnWTFmUXAxXzJxLVZXMUhna2ZjUl9Ja0VJS2pxLXlXRmMzVkc2ZzNTQXNISWYzeUNnOVN1UlYtd0NaUzVhRDI4ZFVXOGhQYV9hY2fSAVZBVV95cUxNVXdnVUQ4OXhzNlJiUmJGbjBJYjNsbEhKcWdPZ2pYNHhyUnkzY3FhZmlfNTdfd05UakMtazNGcmxVd1lzZW4xTV84SG5ZRGdSLXhnYUNFUQ</guid></item><item><title>青少年正试图大量摄入蛋白质补充剂。父母应该注意什么？ - NPR | Teens are trying to bulk up on protein supplements.

                &lt;a href="https://mottpoll.org/reports/teens-and-protein" target="_blank"&gt;A poll of parents&lt;/a&gt; last fall found 40% of teens consumed some type of protein supplement in the past year. Boys took it to bulk up; girls took it to replace meals.

   &lt;p&gt;Emiliano Slesaransky, 17, joined Santa Monica High School's football team as a freshman and — at the urging of coaches and teammates— started hitting the gym whenever possible: in the morning, after school, and on the weekends. The people he met there would share their strategies for bulking up.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They would take protein powders, other supplements like some people I know take ashwagandha, and maybe creatine," he says, citing popular energy and exercise-enhancing supplements. Emiliano started taking some of them, too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But his dad, Eduardo Slesaransky, wanted to make sure his son's diet — and attitude — remained balanced: "My concern was the influence that social media has on these supplements and these kinds of things and the culture of body building and the gyms."&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Protein supplements are big on social media, where&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;influencers are&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;helping drive sales of protein bars, shakes and powders. &lt;a href="https://mottpoll.org/reports/teens-and-protein" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;A poll of parents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by the Mott Children's Hospital at the University of Michigan last fall found 40% of teens consumed some type of protein supplement in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Teen boys were more likely — twice as likely — to consume protein every day," says &lt;a href="https://chear.org/people/faculty-investigators/sarah-clark" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sarah Clark&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a research scientist and co-director of &lt;a href="https://mottpoll.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the poll&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Girls, she says, more often relied on supplements as meal replacements, and the inspiration to consume protein shakes, bars or powders often came from coaches, peers, or influencers on social media. But Clark says parents were also among those promoting protein to their children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I wonder if, as parents, we are recognizing how much messaging we have taken in about protein being good," she says. "We have absorbed this messaging: That's the key to being healthy," she says, when in fact it is only one factor in a balanced, healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-78474" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                The vast majority of teens already get enough protein in their diet without supplements, pediatric dietician Abriana Cain says.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;How much is enough? &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There is also such a thing as &lt;em&gt;too much &lt;/em&gt;protein, says Abriana Cain, a &lt;a href="https://www.childrensnational.org/get-care/departments/clinical-nutrition-services/meet-the-team" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pediatric dietician with Children's National Hospital&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Washington, D.C. As a general rule, Cain tells teens and parents to gauge protein intake based on size — benchmarked at roughly 1 gram of protein a day per kilogram of body weight. (For a 150-pound teen, that amounts to about 68 grams of protein per day — or the rough equivalent of a cup of cooked chicken, a cup of yogurt, and a cup of black beans.)&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"It might even increase from there, based on their physical activity needs," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cain says more than 100 grams a day can damage the kidney and liver in the longer term. It can also cause stomach pain, as it did for one of her patients. "They were eating protein supplements with all of their meals and also with all of their snacks, and they were having a lot of abdominal pain."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The vast majority of teens, Cain says, already get enough protein in their diet without supplements.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;There are also concerns about the marketing of supplements.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There is no quality control for these products, notes pediatrician and eating disorder expert Dr. &lt;a href="https://nagatalab.ucsf.edu/people/jason-nagata-md" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jason Nagata&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, at the University of California San Francisco. Supplements, including protein bars and powders, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/information-consumers-using-dietary-supplements/questions-and-answers-dietary-supplements#:~:text=The%20Dietary%20Supplement%20Health%20and%20Education%20Act%20(DSHEA)%20amended%20the,has%20not%20been%20chemically%20altered." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;are &lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;u&gt; regulated by the Food and Drug Administration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — so they're not tested, and their ingredients aren't verified.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think it's important for teens and parents to know that there isn't that kind of rigorous quality control, especially when you're getting mixtures of muscle building supplements and products," he says. "I would just be very cautious."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nagata advises researching, reading ingredient labels and buying directly from known companies.

"He's focusing on getting into college."&lt;/p&gt;

As such, there is an urgent need to identify new and effective anticancer compounds, particularly those derived from medicinal plants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did the study reveal?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, the research team used a specific bacterium, Lactobacillus plantarum SN13T, to ferment stevia leaves. They compared the fermented version (which they call FSLE) to regular stevia extract and found that FSLE performed better in every way they tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Masanori Sugiyama explained, “To enhance the pharmacological efficacy of natural plant extracts, microbial biotransformation has emerged as an effective strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They optimized the fermentation process and found that stevia was most effective when fermented for 72 hours, at 37°C, without oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were impressive: fermented stevia effectively killed pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1) while barely affecting healthy cells, even at higher doses. This selectivity is crucial for safe cancer treatments. Instead of an immediate kill, FSLE sometimes slowed down cancer cell growth, making them look weak and unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fermented stevia also showed strong antioxidant properties, which is essential since oxidative stress is a big factor in cancer development. It neutralized free radicals more effectively than the non-fermented version, achieving a 94% scavenging power in one test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s the takeaway?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe that fermentation transforms compounds into more active versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a compound called chlorogenic acid is converted into chlorogenic acid methyl ester (CAME) during fermentation. CAME was found to be more effective than regular chlorogenic acid in halting cancer cell growth and triggering cancer cell self-destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its potency was significant: the dose needed to kill half the cancer cells was much lower for CAME compared to regular chlorogenic acid. CAME works by blocking the cell cycle and forcing cells into apoptosis, their self-destruct mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a genetic level, CAME influenced genes associated with cell death, activating pro-apoptotic genes while shutting down those that prevent cell death. This supports the observed effects, showing that CAME doesn’t just kill cells randomly; it drives them into a specific self-destruction pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum up in simpler terms, this research suggests that fermented stevia could be a promising new avenue for effective cancer treatment, particularly for hard-to-treat pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is stevia?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stevia is a sweet sugar substitute that is about 50 to 300 times sweeter than sugar. It is extracted from the leaves of Stevia rebaudiana, a plant (shrub) native to tropical and subtropical America, and areas of Paraguay and Brazil. The active compounds in stevia are steviol glycosides, and the leaves may be used as a calorie-free substitute for sugar. Stevia is heat-stable, pH-stable, and not fermentable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More than just a sweetener:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stevia is not just a substitute for sugar anymore; it’s stepping up its game!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to fermentation, researchers have discovered that stevia extract can be transformed into a compound that fights cancer while leaving healthy cells unharmed. This exciting change is linked to specific enzymes from a bacterial strain called SN13T. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per Danshiitsoodol, “This microbial transformation was likely due to specific enzymes in the bacteria strain used.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings show that this new compound, CAME, is more effective at harming cancer cells and promoting cell death in PANC-1 cells than chlorogenic acid alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The way ahead:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s next for this research? The team has plans to take their work from the lab to the real world, with mouse studies coming up. This will test if fermented stevia can work within living systems, which have complex immune responses and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Danshiitsoodol, “The present study has substantially enhanced our understanding of the mechanism of action of the Lactobacillus plantarum SN13T strain in the fermentation of herbal extracts, while also offering a valuable research perspective on the potential application of probiotics as natural anti-tumor agents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going by this research, with the right microbes, even a simple leaf like stevia could become a powerful weapon against cancer. It’s not bad for a sugar substitute anymore; it’s a natural and valuable component with more than its sweetening qualities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Cancer immunotherapy may also treat certain autoimmune diseases, claims study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 06:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>外科医生在拯救生命的婴儿器官移植中复苏“死”心脏- ScienceAlert | Surgeons Resuscitate 'Dead' Heart in Life-Saving Organ Transplant to Baby - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxOQnUwTzl1TloxN2lnN2phWkVNaEdEV2x4NkEtdkFzeXpuY0ZYRkVxNkxTd2Z4M1AzdFc0a3Ftbk1TczhCaUVZQTVKM3VqUjh5MHRzZFByckpMSHI1azhzVWpTWTdUOFhQUUZZcExNYWNURzN5cERtN01nNTRfNDFZcG1QaS1zOFNWUTJqa2FDbUVZcTFYaU9PeTAwMHljOW05Mnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Surgeons at Duke University have resuscitated a 'dead' heart on the operating table after it stopped beating for more than five minutes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The organ was later transplanted into the chest of a three-month-old child, saving their life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infant with the donor heart continued to show normal cardiac function and no signs of organ rejection at six months of age, according to a brief report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eerie-personality-changes-sometimes-happen-after-organ-transplants?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Eerie Personality Changes Sometimes Happen After Organ Transplants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The story is proof that the concept of 'on-table reanimation' works at preserving hearts for transplantation – at least for infants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the consent of the donor family, surgeons reinvigorated a small donor heart on the operating table using an oxygenator, a centrifugal pump, and a hanging reservoir to collect expelled blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This contraption had to be custom-designed, as current care systems that keep organs alive outside of bodies are too big for infant hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today in the United States, up to 20 percent of infants in need will die waiting for a heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most organ donors must be declared brain dead before donation. Only 0.5 percent of pediatric heart transplants are donated after circulatory death, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;when the heart stops beating and blood stops circulating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some critics do not think it is morally correct to take &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/exclusives/100950"&gt;a terminal patient off life support&lt;/a&gt;, get their heart beating again, and then remove it for transplantation. Concerns arise over declarations of death, and how to reanimate organs in an ethical way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After circulatory death, donor hearts can be re-oxygenated while they are still in the donor body, or they can be resuscitated on the operating table using machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168331" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168331" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/HF-EA-Lee-Pretorius-Fig1-642x390.png" alt="Organ Donation" class="size-medium wp-image-168331" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/HF-EA-Lee-Pretorius-Fig1-642x390.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/HF-EA-Lee-Pretorius-Fig1-683x415.png 683w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/HF-EA-Lee-Pretorius-Fig1-768x467.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/HF-EA-Lee-Pretorius-Fig1-600x365.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/HF-EA-Lee-Pretorius-Fig1.png 1430w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168331" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Organ donation sources and techniques.

They also note that using organs after circulatory death has the potential to increase the donor pool by up to 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another team of surgeons at Vanderbilt University has a different idea. They have devised a way to avoid the most common ethical concerns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their technique doesn't seek to immediately reanimate donor hearts; instead, it preserves them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent brief report, the team explains that with&lt;span&gt; an aorta clamp and a cold-preserving flush of liquid, they successfully recovered three donor hearts for transplantation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By clamping off the heart's circulatory system, the team kept their work separate from the donor's brain (which raises ethical concerns over resuscitation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our technique flushes oxygenated preservation solution to the donor heart only, without reanimation of the heart and without systemic or brain perfusion," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2500456"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In initial surgeries, the technique showed "excellent early postoperative outcomes".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three donor hearts were successfully transplanted with healthy function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This method of heart recovery offers the possibility of broad application," the Vanderbilt surgeons &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2500456"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2503487"&gt;Duke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2500456"&gt;Vanderbilt&lt;/a&gt; reports were both published in &lt;em&gt;NEJM&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks to obesity and alcohol consumption, bowel cancer has become the primary cause of the rising death toll among young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, early detection and lifestyle changes play crucial roles in reducing risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to gastroenterologists like Dr. Joseph Salhab, simple dietary tweaks, particularly smart snacking, can support colon health and lower the risk of developing this disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;How? Incorporating high-fiber, nutrient‑dense snacks into your daily routine not only promotes regular digestion but also feeds beneficial gut microbes that guard against inflammation and carcinogenic processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are six science-backed snack ideas a leading gastroenterologist recommends to help reduce colon cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Yogurt&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yogurt, known as the probiotic powerhouse, is rich in live probiotics like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which support a balanced gut microbiome. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10552-009-9454-4" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; reveals that higher yogurt consumption correlates with a 7% reduction in colorectal cancer risk. The lactic acid bacteria in yogurt may produce antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For snack ideas, try Greek yogurt with fresh berries or yogurt parfaits topped with granola. These snacks are as nourishing and gut-friendly as they’re tasty!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tree nuts&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tree nuts like almonds, cashews, Brazil nuts, more particularly, walnuts offer fiber, healthy fats, and plant compounds like ellagitannins. One clinical trial (published earlier this year in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerpreventionresearch/article/18/4/235/754306/Systemic-Inflammation-and-the-Inflammatory-Context" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Cancer Prevention Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;) showed 28 g of walnuts daily reduced inflammation markers and vimentin levels, proteins tied to aggressive colon tumors. Furthermore, as Dr. Salhab references, in stage III colon cancer patients, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2017.75.5413" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; shows, eating two servings of tree nuts daily reduced disease recurrence by 42%. Aim for a daily nut handful or mix walnuts into trail mix or oatmeal for an antioxidant boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Apples&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;An apple a day might even keep the big C (cancer) at bay. Apples, especially with their skin, offer soluble and insoluble fiber plus flavonoids. One &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1097/CEJ.0b013e328333d0cc" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;case–control study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; linked consuming at least one apple daily to a 47% lower risk of colorectal cancer. Fiber aids bowel regularity and toxin removal, while phytonutrients support gut health. Snack on apple slices with almond butter or part of a lunch fruit salad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Citrus fruits&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydrating and fiber‑rich citrus fruits, like oranges, grapefruits, and clementines, are not only high in fiber, but their water content, vitamins, and bioactive compounds also add to their numerous health benefits. A study, published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-55219-5?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, shows citrus intake may decrease colorectal cancer risk by up to 18%. The combination of antioxidants, fiber, and hydration supports digestion and reduces carcinogen exposure in the colon. Moreover, you can enjoy them fresh, in smoothies, or sprinkled in salads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Watermelon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Made of over 90% water, watermelon aids hydration and regular digestion. This luscious fruit is not only crucial for colon health, but the lycopene and antioxidants in watermelon contribute anti-inflammatory benefits, slashing the risk of colorectal cancer considerably. What’s more? Fresh watermelon slices or blended into agua fresca are a refreshing addition to your daily diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Salsa and guacamole&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one, we hardly see it coming! Tomato-based salsa provides lycopene and fiber, while avocado adds monounsaturated fats, fiber (about 10 g per medium avocado), and antioxidants. Mix them together for &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8270321/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;a gut‑health powerhouse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. As per research, superfruit avocado consumption has been shown to lower colon cancer risk. Moreover, tomatoes and avocados together offer synergistic benefits. So, spruce up your snacking habit using these as dips for whole‑grain crackers or chopped vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt; The information provided in this story is intended for educational and informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.

It's the place where you're likely spending most of your time, and if it's not promoting healthy habits, a consistent routine, or peacefulness, you're going to feel drained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From hurting sleep quality, to sabotaging connection, heightening stress, and even negatively impacting physical well-being, the little things deeply unhappy people have in their homes that anyone else would never buy are significant, yet difficult to notice in the grand scheme of things. Many may be overspending on objects or allowing certain things into their space without even realizing they're negatively impacting their own mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here are 11 little things deeply unhappy people have in their homes that anyone else would never buy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1.

Not only can this add up substantially, especially for people in an already uncertain financial situation, but indulging these subscriptions and services on a daily basis out of guilt for spending on them can negatively impact mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only does mindless entertainment and passive activities like watching TV &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11939997/" rel="nofollow"&gt;tend to damper our mood and well-being&lt;/a&gt;, trying to cope with insecurity, discomfort, or emotional turmoil with distractions like turning on the TV &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/29/1/zmad056/7582213" rel="nofollow"&gt;or doomscrolling on our phones&lt;/a&gt; can be incredibly harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/things-brilliant-people-do-whenever-tempted-doomscroll"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8 Things Brilliant People Do Whenever They're Tempted To Doomscroll&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2.

Not only is it a constant reminder of a habit you're struggling to keep up with, sparking shame and guilt in your everyday life, it's expensive and financially draining, especially for people already struggling with money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though it may be one of the last things an unhappy person wants to indulge, it can be the difference-maker for breaking bad habits and disrupting the cycle of depression they've fallen victim to.

Ms Birch then consulted her 78-year-old grandmother, who recognised Kimie's illness immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"That's measles," her grandmother said. Ms Birch was stunned, as she thought the disease had been eradicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A lab test later confirmed her grandmother's hypothesis: Kimie had measles, likely contracted after a routine visit to the hospital in the Edmonton area a few weeks earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Kimie is one of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;more than 3,800 in Canada who have been infected with measles&lt;/a&gt; in 2025, most of them children and infants. That figure is nearly three times higher than &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the number of confirmed US cases&lt;/a&gt;, despite Canada's far smaller population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Now Canada is the only western country listed among the top 10 with measles outbreaks, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-measles-vaccination/data-research/global-measles-outbreaks/index.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;according to CDC data&lt;/a&gt;, ranking at number eight. Alberta, the province at the epicentre of the current outbreak, has the highest per capita measles spread rate in North America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The data raises questions on why the virus is spreading more rapidly in Canada than in the US, and whether Canadian health authorities are doing enough to contain it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In the US, the rise of measles has been partly linked to vaccine-hesitant public figures, like Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr - although he has since endorsed the measles vaccine as safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But Canada does not have a prominent RFK Jr-like figure in public health, noted Maxwell Smith, a postdoctoral fellow in public health at Western University in southern Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There are other things that need to be interrogated here I think," Dr Smith said. "Looking at the Canadian context adds another layer of complexity to this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Measles overall is on the rise in North America, Europe and the UK. Cases in the US reached a 33-year high this year, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/measles-epidemiology-2023/confirmed-cases-of-measles-in-england-by-month-age-region-and-upper-tier-local-authority-2025" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;while England reported nearly 3,000 confirmed infections in 2024&lt;/a&gt;, its highest count since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Canada's 2025 figures have surpassed both.

It later turned out to be a symptom of measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"This is the first time I've ever seen measles within our community," Ms Friesen told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Cases spread rapidly from that point, reaching a peak of more than 200 a week across Ontario by late April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;While new confirmed cases have since dropped sharply in Ontario, Alberta has emerged as the next hotspot. There, the spread happened so quickly that health officials were unable to pinpoint exactly how or where the outbreak began, said Dr Vivien Suttorp, the medical officer of health in southern Alberta, where cases are the highest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She, too, said she had not seen an outbreak this bad in her 18 years working in public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ms Friesen noted that Canada has a higher concentration of conservative Low German-speaking Mennonites than the US, which may be a factor behind the higher number of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But Mennonites are not a monolith, she said, and many have embraced vaccinations. What's changed is the rapid spread of anti-vaccine misinformation both in her community and beyond after the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There's hearsay that immunisations are bad for you," Ms Friesen said, or are "dangerous".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This is amplified by a general distrust in the healthcare system, which she said has historically ostracised members of her community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We are sometimes put down or looked down upon because of our background," she said, adding that she herself has experienced discrimination in hospitals based on assumptions about her beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;Vaccine hesitancy on the rise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Experts say it's tough to pinpoint why measles have spread wider in Canada than in the US, but many agree that cases in both countries are likely underreported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The numbers that we have in Alberta are just the tip of the iceberg," said Dr Suttorp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But there is one big reason driving the outbreak: low vaccination rates, said Janna Shapiro, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto's Centre for Vaccine Preventable Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Shapiro said there is "an element of chance" at play, where a virus is introduced to a community by accident and spreads among those who are unprotected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The only thing that is going to stop an outbreak is getting those vaccination rates up," she said. "If the public is not willing to get vaccinated, then it will continue until the virus can't find anymore receptible hosts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In general, studies show that vaccine hesitancy has risen in Canada since the pandemic, and the data reflects that. In southern Alberta, for example, the number of MMR vaccines administered has dropped by nearly half from 2019 to 2024, according to provincial figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Covid-19 vaccine mandates were fiercely opposed by some during the pandemic, prompting the so-called "Freedom Convoy" protest in Ottawa where truckers gridlocked the city for two weeks in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;That opposition has since expanded to other vaccines, said Dr Shapiro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Pandemic-related disruptions also left some children behind on routine immunisations. With measles having been largely eliminated, families likely did not prioritise getting their kids' vaccinations up to date, Dr Shapiro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;That is not the case for Ms Birch, who began routine immunisations for her baby Kimie as soon as she was eligible. But Kimie was still too young for the measles vaccine, which is typically given at 12 months in Alberta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Suttorp said Alberta has since lowered that age cap in response to the recent outbreak, and there has been an uptick in people taking the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Health units across the country have also tried to encourage people to get vaccinated through public bulletins and radio advertisements. But the response is notably more muted than that during the Covid-19 pandemic, health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Kimie has since slowly recovered, Ms Birch said, though she continues to be monitored for potential long-term effects of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The Alberta mother said she was saddened and horrified when she learned her daughter had measles, but also "frustrated and annoyed" at those choosing not to vaccinate their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She called on people to heed public health guidelines and "protect the ones that can't protect themselves".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"My four-month-old shouldn't have gotten measles in 2025," Ms Birch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 00:50:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9mNDVwYzgzanoxbDBoLVhRaENVWXFLc3NNMUdPTnhuUEx4WU5xQVJ1YmVPTWMtYXZ2VksyMVBWU2h0djNiY05oSTlnWmFucU5xNEY3cWhiWVRXZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE9Pc0twY2ZlUVk1VFZJMUtmMnJHSTJpS0EzOFp1Tm55VnotYWphN0EwNXlpWGdQRGNfcWRENjlzLWg3bGhNbnNxTGliSklmajYyVWxJUGpTNUVkd25mR3Rn</guid></item><item><title>加拿大如何成为北美麻疹疫情的中心- BBC | How Canada became the centre of a measles outbreak in North America - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9mNDVwYzgzanoxbDBoLVhRaENVWXFLc3NNMUdPTnhuUEx4WU5xQVJ1YmVPTWMtYXZ2VksyMVBWU2h0djNiY05oSTlnWmFucU5xNEY3cWhiWVRXZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;How Canada became the centre of a measles outbreak in North America&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-801dd632-0 eSlECZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-801dd632-12 jSIeFi"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-801dd632-5 kRoBHa"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-7 lasLGY"&gt;Nadine Yousif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-801dd632-8 hwLppI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC News, Toronto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3fb2/live/a9ac1a00-63ee-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3fb2/live/a9ac1a00-63ee-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3fb2/live/a9ac1a00-63ee-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3fb2/live/a9ac1a00-63ee-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3fb2/live/a9ac1a00-63ee-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3fb2/live/a9ac1a00-63ee-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3fb2/live/a9ac1a00-63ee-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3fb2/live/a9ac1a00-63ee-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Canadian Press Catalina Friesen, a personal support worker and Low German-speaking liaison, stands in front of a bus outfitted as a mobile walk-in clinic, in St. Thomas, Ontario.

Ms Birch then consulted her 78-year-old grandmother, who recognised Kimie's illness immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"That's measles," her grandmother said. Ms Birch was stunned, as she thought the disease had been eradicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A lab test later confirmed her grandmother's hypothesis: Kimie had measles, likely contracted after a routine visit to the hospital in the Edmonton area a few weeks earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Kimie is one of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;more than 3,800 in Canada who have been infected with measles&lt;/a&gt; in 2025, most of them children and infants. That figure is nearly three times higher than &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the number of confirmed US cases&lt;/a&gt;, despite Canada's far smaller population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Now Canada is the only western country listed among the top 10 with measles outbreaks, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-measles-vaccination/data-research/global-measles-outbreaks/index.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;according to CDC data&lt;/a&gt;, ranking at number eight. Alberta, the province at the epicentre of the current outbreak, has the highest per capita measles spread rate in North America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The data raises questions on why the virus is spreading more rapidly in Canada than in the US, and whether Canadian health authorities are doing enough to contain it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In the US, the rise of measles has been partly linked to vaccine-hesitant public figures, like Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr - although he has since endorsed the measles vaccine as safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But Canada does not have a prominent RFK Jr-like figure in public health, noted Maxwell Smith, a postdoctoral fellow in public health at Western University in southern Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There are other things that need to be interrogated here I think," Dr Smith said. "Looking at the Canadian context adds another layer of complexity to this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Measles overall is on the rise in North America, Europe and the UK. Cases in the US reached a 33-year high this year, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/measles-epidemiology-2023/confirmed-cases-of-measles-in-england-by-month-age-region-and-upper-tier-local-authority-2025" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;while England reported nearly 3,000 confirmed infections in 2024&lt;/a&gt;, its highest count since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Canada's 2025 figures have surpassed both.

There, the spread happened so quickly that health officials were unable to pinpoint exactly how or where the outbreak began, said Dr Vivien Suttorp, the medical officer of health in southern Alberta, where cases are the highest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She, too, said she had not seen an outbreak this bad in her 18 years working in public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ms Friesen noted that Canada has a higher concentration of conservative Low German-speaking Mennonites than the US, which may be a factor behind the higher number of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But Mennonites are not a monolith, she said, and many have embraced vaccinations. What's changed is the rapid spread of anti-vaccine misinformation both in her community and beyond after the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There's hearsay that immunisations are bad for you," Ms Friesen said, or are "dangerous".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This is amplified by a general distrust in the healthcare system, which she said has historically ostracised members of her community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We are sometimes put down or looked down upon because of our background," she said, adding that she herself has experienced discrimination in hospitals based on assumptions about her beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;Vaccine hesitancy on the rise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Experts say it's tough to pinpoint why measles have spread wider in Canada than in the US, but many agree that cases in both countries are likely underreported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The numbers that we have in Alberta are just the tip of the iceberg," said Dr Suttorp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But there is one big reason driving the outbreak: low vaccination rates, said Janna Shapiro, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto's Centre for Vaccine Preventable Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Shapiro said there is "an element of chance" at play, where a virus is introduced to a community by accident and spreads among those who are unprotected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The only thing that is going to stop an outbreak is getting those vaccination rates up," she said. "If the public is not willing to get vaccinated, then it will continue until the virus can't find anymore receptible hosts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In general, studies show that vaccine hesitancy has risen in Canada since the pandemic, and the data reflects that. In southern Alberta, for example, the number of MMR vaccines administered has dropped by nearly half from 2019 to 2024, according to provincial figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Covid-19 vaccine mandates were fiercely opposed by some during the pandemic, prompting the so-called "Freedom Convoy" protest in Ottawa where truckers gridlocked the city for two weeks in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;That opposition has since expanded to other vaccines, said Dr Shapiro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Pandemic-related disruptions also left some children behind on routine immunisations. With measles having been largely eliminated, families likely did not prioritise getting their kids' vaccinations up to date, Dr Shapiro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;That is not the case for Ms Birch, who began routine immunisations for her baby Kimie as soon as she was eligible. But Kimie was still too young for the measles vaccine, which is typically given at 12 months in Alberta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Suttorp said Alberta has since lowered that age cap in response to the recent outbreak, and there has been an uptick in people taking the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Health units across the country have also tried to encourage people to get vaccinated through public bulletins and radio advertisements. But the response is notably more muted than that during the Covid-19 pandemic, health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Kimie has since slowly recovered, Ms Birch said, though she continues to be monitored for potential long-term effects of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The Alberta mother said she was saddened and horrified when she learned her daughter had measles, but also "frustrated and annoyed" at those choosing not to vaccinate their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She called on people to heed public health guidelines and "protect the ones that can't protect themselves".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"My four-month-old shouldn't have gotten measles in 2025," Ms Birch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 00:50:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9mNDVwYzgzanoxbDBoLVhRaENVWXFLc3NNMUdPTnhuUEx4WU5xQVJ1YmVPTWMtYXZ2VksyMVBWU2h0djNiY05oSTlnWmFucU5xNEY3cWhiWVRXZw</guid></item><item><title>与癌症疾病相关的刷牙.. -大安得拉邦 | Brushing Teeth Linked To Cancer Disease.. - Great Andhra</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxNOTJ2LVVhT253Y0xTSkxKU2tUaHlBajB1RW1Id1poN1Nrb3hVR2RlUGV2Rm9ydTk0MmxqYnZXMFZ3R1hKQ0Y3elFVaWxXQzNyRXJQbWEtc01OM011aHo1MkJnMkdDTFB5allRMHUxOHRtLU9FY3F4TjQ5NHRWUXJEMWI2b1B5RS1ralBNX2NFcmdhVkZzSlVucnpSVDlrdTlYcUHSAZABQVVfeXFMTXhzSjNhdkYtak03WU9GZzNtY0VfY3gyYXdtdDhCQ0J2UG11Ukc4REFpQnV3WU5wNUhqRFBpUjJWT1NvUlp5bXRrLVBPVl9vcm5IMDV4RHlORE5jaEI1ZGpuYXlIZnQwd2p0aDJXaVJHWlRCT1ZoWTB6X2JleGxoMTJSbzZfYVptT29VQ1VqU0N6?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="unselectable"&gt;

					
						
												&lt;p&gt;A recent AIIMS Delhi study highlights the critical role of oral health in preventing and managing serious illnesses, including cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers emphasized that oral hygiene practices must be integrated into all levels of healthcare, not just at the primary level, to improve overall health outcomes and reduce disease risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence links poor oral hygiene with conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and especially cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gum disease, in particular, shows strong association with cancers of the head, neck, lungs, breast and digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data from international studies revealed that routine dental care, like brushing daily and visiting the dentist annually; can reduce the risk of head and neck cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cancer treatment, especially radiotherapy, significantly affects oral health. Patients with poor gum health face higher complications after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, maintaining oral hygiene before, during and after therapy is essential for better recovery and survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study calls for better data from South Asia, awareness campaigns, school-based brushing programs and policies restricting sugar and tobacco promotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers recommend that WHO South-East Asia Region implement affordable, evidence, based oral health programs to reduce cancer risks and health inequalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public awareness, supervised brushing and policy changes could help transform oral healthcare in India and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

You don't usually have a warning and they will knock you down to the floor until they're over.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zeller, who lives in Montana, spent much of his adult life suffering attacks up to four times a day for months at a time until they suddenly disappeared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His clusters have slowed in recent years, but like the 1 in 1,000 Americans with the disorder, Zeller waits for the next attack with limited tools at his disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his newly released book, &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;The Headache: The Science of a Most Confounding Affliction – and a Search for Relief&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Zeller detailed his decades–long search for cluster headache relief, along with the wackiest things he's tried to quell the pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Journalist Tom Zeller Jr's new book explores treatments and causes of cluster headaches&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I never wanted to write this book, to be honest. I did not want people to know I had headaches. It's just terrible to be seen in this way,' Zeller told DailyMail.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But I also felt like if you're going to write a book, they say, "Write about what you know." I realized that I know headaches.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cluster headaches are extremely painful and strike quickly in frequent attacks, or 'clusters,' lasting weeks or months at a time, earning the grim nickname 'suicide headaches.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disorder usually causes sharp and stabbing pain in or around the eye, restlessness, tears and eye redness, forehead sweating, swelling around the eye and eyelid drooping. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14579791/migraines-surprising-cure-effects-doctor-free.html"&gt;close relative of migraines&lt;/a&gt;, they're far less common. About 0.1 percent of Americans have had a cluster headache attack at some point in their lives, while 15 percent – most of whom are women – have migraines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For Zeller, the attacks drove a wedge in his journalism career, often forcing him to 'retreat from opportunities in the newsroom.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's not easy. The book talks about how any sort of headache disorder is kind of a drag on the momentum of your life. They're always slowing you down,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I wasn't having the headaches, I felt like I was pretty bold and pretty accomplished as a journalist. But when the headaches would come on, I would sort of disappear and I would work from home a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cluster headaches affect one in 1,000 Americans and cause debilitating pain (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's a lot of stigma attached to headaches in a weird way. I tried very hard to make sure that no one knew that I had these headaches. You start to hide and that meant hiding from opportunities at work too.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Throughout the book, Zeller detailed a laundry list of unorthodox treatments he tried or researched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was being ground down by the relentless injections, self–administered into an abdomen bruised and pockmarked by previous jabs, and overuse of the medication was likely driving an endless cycle of rebound attacks,' he wrote in his book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Given this unappealing tableau, why not shrooms?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Psilocybin, the active compound in magic mushrooms, has been shown to alter how the brain processes and perceives pain signals and is thought to reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He's also tried inhaling capsaicin, an extract in chili peppers that gives them their signature heat. Some research suggests it helps desensitize nerve fibers in the nasal passages that transmit cluster headache pain to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zeller also rented oxygen tanks from a welding supplier as a 'really fast way to abort a cluster headache attack.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I also remember a forum saying that if you just tried to chug like 60 glasses of water a day, or some absurd amount, it would cure your headaches. I was willing to try, but all I did was visit the toilet a lot with headaches,' he recalled. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zeller said many patients with cluster headaches have to rely on bizarre hacks because of the lack of medications geared specifically toward their condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured is the cover of Tom Zeller Jr's book&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The thing that surprised me most, and what probably prompted the book, was that so little research was out there on primary headache disorders,' Zeller explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients are often prescribed beta blockers, antipsychotics, antidepressants and other drugs manufactured for other illnesses, as they can treat headaches in some people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recently, the advent of CGRP drugs has changed the picture. Approved by the FDA in 2018, these preventative drugs block or reduce the effects of CGRP, which causes migraine and cluster headache pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A lot of times you'll find a drug or remedy that does kind of work, but the body adapts. We're very plastic, and over time, those things start to wane,' Zeller said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zeller uses the CGRP medication Emgality, the only FDA approved medication specifically designed for cluster headaches and migraines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cluster headache dose of Emgality is significantly higher than the migraine dose – 300 milligrams compared to 120 milligrams – and both versions are given through a subcutaneous injection just under the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Cluster headaches are their own unique animal, so once the headaches start happening, it does seem to be pretty hard to stop,' Zeller revealed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But I think three times in I'm sort of convinced that the CGRP blockers work for me to stop a bout from happening.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The book opens with him tripping on magic mushrooms for cluster headaches (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like migraines, cluster headaches often become less frequent and severe with age, which some research suggests could be due to hormonal fluctuations and altered blood vessel function in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zeller's clusters in recent years have slowed and can now fall years apart, but he's far from being in remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I don't think I, or anyone really, is out of the woods yet,' he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For now, Zeller said he hopes his new book will help improve cluster headache awareness and provide a sense of community for readers with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his research, he spoke with several cluster headache and migraine patients who at first were 'guarded' and wary of speaking about their experience over fears of it being trivialized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But throughout the interviews, they became excited because they had 'this pent–up desire to just unload about it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I hope they feel seen by the book,' Zeller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Someone out there is paying attention and you can take heart in that, and if you're able to buy time between painful bouts, I hope that you know the book will be affirming in that you know you're not alone.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;The Headache: The Science of a Most Confounding Affliction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;

We were grappling with the fact that Ben had gone from being apparently perfectly healthy to having months to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Had we not met Dr Mulholland, that would have been it for us. We felt we had a lucky break in an otherwise devastating situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Trotman went on to have the current standard treatment of radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chia seeds provide fiber, omega-3s and antioxidants that can help lower cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chia seeds are versatile, cost-effective and easy to incorporate into a heart-healthy diet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating plant-based foods, exercising and not smoking are also important for better cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to lowering cholesterol levels, lifestyle changes are key. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292224/high-cholesterol-diet-plan/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;High cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, or hypercholesterolemia, occurs when excess cholesterol is present in the blood.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.vandanasheth.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Vandana Sheth, RDN, CDCES, FAND&lt;/a&gt; says, “High cholesterol is linked to diet, genetics and lifestyle. Over time, this can increase your risk for heart disease.” The good news is that even just a few simple tweaks to your diet can make a big difference in managing your cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For example, adding a sprinkle of chia seeds to your meals is an easy way to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-helped-me-eat-more-fiber-11734788" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;boost your intake of soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt; and healthy fats—key nutrients for lowering cholesterol. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, one review showed that consuming 35 grams (about 2.5 tablespoons) of chia seeds per day led to noticeable reductions  in LDL (“bad”) cholesterol and triglyceride levels compared to the control group.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Here, registered dietitians explain why chia seeds are the #1 food to eat more of if you have high cholesterol, along with other strategies for managing your levels. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seeds-benefits-11705262" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chia seeds&lt;/a&gt; are the edible seeds of the &lt;em&gt;Salvia hispanica&lt;/em&gt; plant and are an impressive source of dietary fiber, plant-based protein, antioxidants, omega‐3 fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; They’re also naturally low in saturated fat and easy to incorporate into meals and snacks. Here are some of the reasons why adding chia seeds to your diet may be beneficial if you have high cholesterol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Provide an Ample Amount of Fiber  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are rich in fiber, with a 2-tablespoon serving providing 10 grams of fiber, including 1.5 grams of soluble fiber. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to help lower cholesterol by binding to cholesterol in the small intestine and removing it from your body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “When chia seed is mixed with water, the soluble fiber forms a gel called &lt;em&gt;mucilage,&lt;/em&gt; which can help transport cholesterol out of the body through the digestive tract,” says &lt;a href="http://kristydelcoro.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kristy Del Coro, MS, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;. Research suggests that consuming at least 5–10 grams of soluble fiber per day may reduce LDL cholesterol by 5.5–11 mg per deciliter.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another impressive benefit of chia seeds is their rich concentration of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory effects.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Chia seeds are rich in plant-based &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fats&lt;/a&gt;, which positively support heart health,” says Sheth. Research suggests that ALA can help lower total and LDL cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It may also help increase HDL (“good”) cholesterol levels, though the findings weren’t significant.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are simple to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;incorporate into a healthy diet&lt;/a&gt; and are relatively inexpensive—especially if you buy them in bulk. Akerman notes that while the price varies by brand, chia seeds are generally cost-effective as you’ll likely only use a tablespoon or two at a time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds can be added to virtually any dish, from creamy overnight oats to dinner-sized salads. “Add chia seeds to a smoothie, mix into a yogurt, soak overnight in soy milk (also good for lowering cholesterol) to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seed-pudding-8430793" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;make a chia pudding&lt;/a&gt; or use [them] in granola. Powder form can be used in baked goods, bread or cracker doughs, oatmeal or smoothies,” says Del Coro. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overnight chia seed pudding is Sheth’s favorite recipe for a delicious, heart-healthy breakfast or snack. She varies up the milk (almond, soy) and adds fresh fruit (berries, mango, stone fruit) and a small handful of chopped nuts (pistachios, walnuts, almonds). You can also sprinkle chia seeds over a slice of avocado toast, add them to a classic PB&amp;amp;J or use them to make a DIY &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/homemade-protein-powder-11713647" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein powder&lt;/a&gt;. Just make sure to add chia seeds gradually into your diet and drink plenty of water to avoid &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dangers-of-chia-seeds-11717491" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;digestive side effects&lt;/a&gt;, like bloating or gas. Sheth notes that this is particularly important if you’re not used to eating a high-fiber diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unopened, chia seeds can last up to 5 years when stored in a cool, dry place, like a pantry or cabinet. Once opened, Akerman recommends storing chia seeds in an airtight container in the fridge to extend their shelf life and prevent them from going rancid. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Certain risk factors for high cholesterol, like your genetics, age and family history, are outside of your control. However, there are several lifestyle changes you can make to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cardiologist-recommendations-for-high-cholesterol-8715965" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;help lower your cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; and support heart health. Here are three strategies to try:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Eat more plants  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sheth recommends filling your plate with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7943524/plant-based-low-cholesterol-dinner-plan/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based foods&lt;/a&gt; and heart-healthy fats, like olive oil, to help lower cholesterol. Whole, minimally processed plant-based foods, like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts, seeds and legumes, are packed with beneficial nutrients for heart health and cholesterol levels. In addition to providing fiber, healthy fats, antioxidants and essential vitamins and minerals, they’re also typically low in saturated fat. Compared to omnivorous diets, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291622/the-health-benefits-of-eating-a-plant-based-diet-and-how-to-get-started/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vegan and vegetarian diets&lt;/a&gt; have been associated with lower total and LDL cholesterol levels and a reduced risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Akerman highlights the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/exercise-may-reduce-heart-disease-by-lowering-stress-response-8635621" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;importance of physical activity&lt;/a&gt;. Regular exercise is shown to increase HDL and lower LDL levels. To help prevent or reduce high cholesterol, the American Heart Association recommends engaging in at least 150 minutes of moderate to intense cardiovascular exercise per week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Swimming, cycling, running and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8042248/walking-plan-to-lower-cholesterol-levels/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;brisk walking&lt;/a&gt; are all classic examples of aerobic exercise. Dancing, hiking, vigorous yard work and gardening also count. If you’re new to exercise, it’s important to talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise regimen.

Eating an overall healthy diet that’s rich in minimally processed plant-based foods, moving your body daily and not smoking are also key. Cholesterol-lowering medications may also be necessary for some folks. Regardless of where you start, identify at least one or two changes you can make today to start moving towards a more heart-healthy lifestyle.

Arevalo, a New York-based registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eating them alone makes it even worse," she cautioned. "When eating them together with &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/healthy-foods" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein and fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;protein and fiber&lt;/a&gt;, we are cushioning their effect by slowing their absorption."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to lowering blood sugar levels, meal sequencing may also assist with &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/weight-loss" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:weight loss;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that eating protein before refined carbs promotes the secretion of the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) from the gut, which delays gastric emptying and suppresses appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;In addition to lowering blood sugar levels, meal sequencing may also assist with weight loss.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you eat other foods first — mainly fiber-rich foods — and then you &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment/water" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:drink water;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;drink water&lt;/a&gt;, the fiber from the foods helps you feel satisfied, thus decreasing your appetite," Arevalo told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And let’s not forget that fiber also helps to reduce the absorption of sugar in the blood, helping to cushion your sugar levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complex carbohydrates — such as most vegetables, beans and legumes — are rich in fiber and slow to digest, which causes a gradual rise in blood sugar levels, according to the UCLA report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refined carbohydrates — such as sugar, white rice and white flour — have higher glycemic levels, which are easier to break down and contribute to faster blood sugar spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As nutrition experts pointed out, eating fiber before refined carbohydrates can help slow the carbs’ absorption, which helps blood sugar levels stay lower &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/digestive-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:during digestion;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;during digestion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Eating fiber before refined carbohydrates can help slow the carbs’ absorption, which helps blood sugar levels stay lower during digestion.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assist with healthier food choices and to monitor blood sugar levels after a meal, experts recommend using a food rating system called the glycemic index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This rating scale determines how quickly certain foods can cause blood sugars to rise and fall, according to the UCLA report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those interested in trying &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/diet-trends" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:meal sequencing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;meal sequencing&lt;/a&gt;, Susie laid out the following steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="caas-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with eating non-starchy vegetables first, as the fiber slows digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eat protein and healthy fats.

			&lt;p&gt;Keep calm and try &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid"&gt;omega-3&lt;/a&gt;. The fatty acids, available as dietary supplements via fish oil capsules and thought to help with mental and physical well-being, could also cut down on aggression, according to a 2024 study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings haven't come out of nowhere: omega-3 has previously been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fish-oil-helps-at-risk-teenagers-avoid-schizophrenia-even-8-years-later"&gt;preventing schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, while aggression and antisocial behavior are thought in part to stem from a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/190990"&gt;lack of nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. What we eat can influence our brain's chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania built on earlier, smaller studies of omega-3 supplementation effects on aggression. Their  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/meta-analysis" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73088" data-postid="167150" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; looked at 29 randomized controlled trials across 3,918 participants in total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all the trials, a modest but noticeable short-term effect was found, translating to up to a 28 percent &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/venting-doesnt-reduce-anger-but-something-else-does-study-finds"&gt;reduction in aggression&lt;/a&gt; across multiple different variables (including age, gender, medical diagnosis, and length and dosage of treatment).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alpha-male-primates-a-myth-researchers-find-in-new-study?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Alpha Male Primates a Myth, Researchers Find in New Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the time has come to implement omega-3 supplementation to reduce aggression, irrespective of whether the setting is the community, the clinic, or the criminal justice system," &lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/time-has-come-implement-omega-3-supplementation-reduce-aggression"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; neurocriminologist Adrian Raine when the meta-analysis was published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_149438" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-149438" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/FowDiagramDetailingProcessOfReview.jpg" alt="Flow diagram detailing steps of review process." class="wp-image-149438 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/FowDiagramDetailingProcessOfReview.jpg 673w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/FowDiagramDetailingProcessOfReview-642x495.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/FowDiagramDetailingProcessOfReview-538x415.jpg 538w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/FowDiagramDetailingProcessOfReview-600x463.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-149438" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Flow diagram of literature search leading to 28 suitable papers.

They covered a variety of demographics, from &lt;a href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jcpp.12314"&gt;children aged 16 and under&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10284150290007119"&gt;older people aged between 50 and 60&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the reductions in aggression included both reactive aggression (in response to provocation) and proactive aggression (behavior planned in advance). Before this study, it wasn't clear if omega-3 could help with these different types of aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While larger studies across longer periods of time are going to be needed to further establish this relationship, it adds to our understanding of how fish oil pills and the omega-3 in them might be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/some-kids-with-adhd-may-see-improvement-with-fish-oil-pills-but-results-are-mixed"&gt;beneficial for the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the very least, parents seeking treatment for an aggressive child should know that in addition to any other treatment that their child receives, an extra portion or two of fish each week could also help," Raine &lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/time-has-come-implement-omega-3-supplementation-reduce-aggression"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_149436" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-149436" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ExamplesOfFoodsThatHaveOmega3-e1736917333981.jpeg" alt="One Dietary Supplement Found to Reduce Aggression by Up to 28%" class="size-full wp-image-149436" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-149436" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Natural sources of omega-3 in foods.

There are still a lot of unanswered questions, but the team suggests there's enough evidence to look into this further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/7/2154"&gt;the studies that show&lt;/a&gt; that medications derived from fish oil can help reduce the risk of fatal heart attacks, strokes, and other heart health problems, and there seems to be plenty of upside to adding some omega-3 to your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Omega-3 is not a magic bullet that is going to completely solve the problem of violence in society," &lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/time-has-come-implement-omega-3-supplementation-reduce-aggression"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Raine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But can it help?

Heemskerk says his dad was less than enthusiastic about his son assuming the Playboy mantle — “F*** no” was his response to news of the appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Both men had dealings with Playboy’s founder, &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/hugh-hefner-widow-crystal-marriage-brainswashed-wm0kzmh6c" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;Hugh Hefner&lt;/a&gt;. “He was a small guy — the translator towered over him but when he started talking he was mesmerising,” recalls the wiry Heemskerk. “He oozed power and intelligence … and then the other side of him was just a dirty old man.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="2.5"&gt;&lt;div id="12a72786-de23-4b3f-a8c3-a0527eeb5035"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;In his Playboy days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;EYEVINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Heemskerk resigned in pique from his editorship of the Dutch organ in 2012, half a decade before the Playboy empire would have to reckon with fallout pertaining to the &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/world/article/playboy-founder-high-hefner-accused-of-drugging-and-secretly-filming-bunnies-5ksxzsp8p" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;most sordid aspects of Hefner’s life&lt;/a&gt; — among them allegations of drugging, coercion and using his power to silence women — in the wake of #MeToo. During Heemskerk’s tenure, the principal challenge for Playboy was one of competing with what we shall euphemistically refer to as “the possibilities of the internet”. Newsstand cover lines from the period before his departure — “The jokes page is back!” — speak to escalating desperation in that regard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The rustic home Heemskerk Jr shares with his wife, the De Volkskrant newspaper executive Corinne van Duin, is half an hour’s drive from Amsterdam in the village of Nederhorst den Berg and is a far cry from the Playboy Mansion. This being Dutch farmland, the water feature I must navigate is a bucolic dyke rather than a lagoon pool. In fact, the only clue to Heemskerk’s former life is a bunny-emblazoned security pass lanyard that now dangles from the charge card for the family’s small electric Fiat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;These days, Heemskerk — who has three grown-up sons of his own — is an ambassador not for Playboy but for a certain defiant approach to having Parkinson’s disease, for which he has written a book: &lt;i&gt;Parkinson’s for Beginners&lt;/i&gt;. Its millennial pink cover shows a caricature of Heemskerk flipping the bird, his middle finger vibrating with the involuntary “shakes” that are the best-known manifestation of the disease. Heemskerk describes his approach as “on the offensive”. It wasn’t always this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/crystal-hefner-the-playboy-mansion-was-riddled-with-black-mould-6hthpsltr" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crystal Hefner: ‘The Playboy Mansion was riddled with black mould’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Nine years into a post-Playboy portfolio career that included founding a short-lived crowdfunding platform for glamour photography, Heemskerk was diagnosed with Parkinson’s in 2021 after multiple people — a producer on a daytime TV show, his parents — noticed him staring into space or dragging his feet. He duly went to see his GP who, concerned by Heemskerk’s performance in a balance exercise, referred him to a neurologist in Hilversum, the town 15 minutes away that is the epicentre of the Netherlands’s media industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In “Hillywood” the Parkinson’s diagnosis came instantaneously, after which a shocked Heemskerk resolved to hunker down and exist in ignorance. It seemed to him uniquely unfair that he should be saddled with a degenerative disease after having cleaned his act up so comprehensively. Since leaving Playboy he had renounced his former routine of “parties that go on deep into the night, lots of red meat and alcohol” in a body-and-soul makeover chronicled via two self-help books published under the umbrella title &lt;i&gt;Als Jan het kan&lt;/i&gt; … (&lt;i&gt;If Jan Can Do It …&lt;/i&gt;). For the first book he reformed his diet, renounced booze and shed nearly four stone after Van Duin made disparaging remarks about his waistline. For the second he investigated meditation and other wellness practices in an attempt to cure the insomnia that had dogged him for years — something he now suspects may have been an early sign of Parkinson’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Affronted by the diagnosis, he delegated all reading on the subject of Parkinson’s to Van Duin, who was instructed only to relay the “good” news — of which there seemed precious little. Then, after almost two years with his head in the sand, Heemskerk decided it was time to face up to the matter at hand. &lt;i&gt;Parkinson’s for Beginners &lt;/i&gt;is his attempt to make up for lost time and — in keeping with his new role as spokesperson for the Parkinson’s charity Parkinson NL — spread awareness about what is now the fastest-growing neurological condition in the world, affecting between seven and ten million people globally, with estimates predicting a doubling of cases by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="2.14"&gt;&lt;div id="befed110-3033-4e11-91ac-14db7b519971"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Jan Heemskerk Sr in 1977&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;ALAMY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;On a cellular level the disease is caused by the abnormal accumulation of a protein that prompts the death of nerve cells in a metabolically active part of the brain called the substantia nigra. This leads to a deficit in dopamine, a chemical that plays an important part in controlling movement and maintaining posture. Everything from memory and sight to swallowing and speech can be affected, and the standard treatment remains Levodopa, a dopamine replacement agent in use since the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;While there is a small hereditary component — if a first-degree relative has Parkinson’s, you have a 2.4 per cent chance of developing it, as opposed to 0.8 per cent otherwise — the biggest culprits by far, Heemskerk says, are likely to be environmental. Parkinson’s is emphatically a disease of industrialised nations, with pesticides likely playing a role. As with the wine-growing regions of France, residents of the celebrated Bollenstreek — the bulb-growing swathe of the Netherlands with vividly striped tulip fields that draw millions of visitors — have an elevated incidence of Parkinson’s, with farmers and gardeners as a group 2 to 2.5 times more likely to get the disease, according to Professor Bas Bloem of Radboud University in Nijmegen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/parkinsons-disease-symptoms-creativity-h9vz9sfmc" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parkinson’s and me: on good days I convince myself that life is as it was&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Luckily, the Netherlands punches above its weight when it comes to Parkinson’s research. Leiden University Medical Centre is using the Netherlands Donor Faeces Bank to investigate whether faecal transplants can help slow the progression of Parkinson’s. And this year Amsterdam University Medical Centre (UMC) will launch Plants for Parkinson’s, a programme to investigate whether the positive impact of plant-based nutrition — which the hospital found could be just as effective as painkillers and anti-inflammatories in alleviating symptoms for patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis — extends to Parkinson’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Keen to get ahead of the game, Heemskerk switched to a vegan diet in the course of writing this book and enlisted the Amsterdam Nutritional Assessment Center and a UMC-affiliated dietician to monitor his progress over several months. The results, detailed in the book, are encouraging, with Heemskerk showing marked improvement across metrics including hand-grip strength (an indication of overall muscle function) and a timed chair stand, which determines balance and risk of falling. The hardened carnivore party animal is now, by his own admission, “an advanced vegan”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Resplendent in charcoal grey athleisurewear, Heemskerk says he now feels overwhelmingly grateful for the midlife health kick that stood him in such good stead for his diagnosis. His beloved golf may no longer be viable (“I kept losing the ball”) but he has stuck with his Fit20 brand of high-intensity strength training and — a reformed dog-hater — delights in taking the family labradoodle, Pippa, for 10km walks. He has found solace in membership of a sea-shanty choir. But he’s not peddling &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/culture/books/article/salt-path-scandal-how-it-happened-raynor-winn-wn0rb7w5n" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Salt Path&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-style miracles. In the book, he describes crying in frustration and admits that life with Parkinson’s can be tough: “I am borderline deaf, blind as a bat, always losing everything and never know what day of the week it is.” Today is the hottest day of the year and he’s clearly finding speech very difficult — with Van Duin stepping in to interpret when his stammer becomes too muddy for me to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He is at his most animated when I ask about the causes of Parkinson’s and what he considers our collective complacency with regard to industrialised agriculture. In September 2023, for example, the European Food Safety Authority granted a ten-year extension for the use of glyphosate, one of the most controversial herbicides when it comes to Parkinson’s. “Sometimes I feel like I should be out there telling people that they are in grave danger,” he says, gesturing towards the tidy, silent farmland all around us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;When he does venture out, the man who was once the Netherlands’ foremost authority on how to make it in the “glamour industry” is waggish about how times have changed. He tells me about a recent excursion during which he was startled from his reverie by a young woman tapping urgently at his arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Was this an aspiring High Street Honey seeking career advice? A disapproving feminist?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Nope, she just wanted to help me cross the road.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPazZ2X3FPb01lc1pwVEs5SVJzd3Vpemo4VWI2VGJ5a1llVlp1RFY0Y3RrRF9HUVZPR3JUQmgtS0hlWmJrdG1MaHZhdHV3bUlpRG8zeEp0OG1mMDBGTlBUY3VrTzMydDBPSXdNNHVETlFDcHAwdDAtWnhXOGpMQlBlTHhLZDgwWUF1ejh1YUdlV0pKRkNkdkx0Vnk0ZDhCd005bUI2MHUwZ0k2OGc</guid></item><item><title>在这9个史坦顿岛邮政编码中在蚊子中检测到西尼罗河病毒- SILive.com | West Nile virus detected in mosquitoes in these 9 Staten Island ZIP codes - SILive.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OW4DCD5ESBBRPJHLIFDOJHEAQ4"&gt;STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. — Mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus have been detected across New York City, with Staten Island accounting for the majority of recent cases, &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/west-nile-virus-activity.page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/west-nile-virus-activity.page"&gt;according to data from the New York City Health Department.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3B3UMXBSJNB2ROKHSR5DZ2T6ME"&gt;Of the &lt;a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/rpa7X/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/rpa7X/"&gt;141 positive mosquito results citywide&lt;/a&gt; in 2025, approximately 47% or 66 came from Staten Island, &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/west-nile-virus-reports.page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/west-nile-virus-reports.page"&gt;according to the 2025 positive results summary.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UIORCDQ5I5A3XALFNLOR3J2FMU"&gt;The Health Department collected the samples to monitor the spread of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5XLS7D7EWVD4XMMI2LSM6OF57Q"&gt;In the past two weeks, mosquitoes carrying West Nile virus were detected in nine of 12 Staten Island ZIP codes, according to recent trap data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LQEP7IKVCJE4VCOPVTFJ47AJ6A"&gt;The most widespread activity was reported in ZIP code 10314, where positive samples were found on five different dates.

By analyzing brain scans from young adults, researchers found that individuals with higher levels of psychopathic traits showed distinctive patterns of structural connections in the brain. These patterns, in turn, were associated with behaviors that involve acting out, suggesting that the brain’s wiring might help explain some of the behavioral tendencies linked to psychopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychopathy is often associated with impulsivity, aggression, and antisocial behavior. While past studies have focused heavily on how different brain regions function in people with psychopathic traits, less is known about how these regions are structurally connected. Structural connectivity refers to the physical links between brain areas—similar to the brain’s wiring system. The researchers aimed to go beyond earlier work that focused only on specific brain circuits and instead look across the entire brain to identify any structural patterns linked to psychopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were especially interested in understanding whether structural differences in the brain might explain the relationship between psychopathic traits and externalizing behaviors. Previous models have suggested two possible brain-based explanations for these behaviors. One theory emphasizes problems in how people process emotional threats, while another highlights difficulties in attention control. Both theories have some support, but no study had comprehensively examined how structural brain networks might connect psychopathy with real-world behavioral problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team analyzed data from 82 young adults who participated in the Leipzig Mind-Brain-Body study. All participants were screened to rule out medical or psychological conditions that might affect the results. Psychopathic traits were assessed using a questionnaire designed to capture both interpersonal-affective characteristics (like manipulation and lack of empathy) and behavioral traits (like impulsivity and rule-breaking). Externalizing behaviors were also measured with a separate questionnaire that included items on aggression, defiance, and similar tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant underwent high-resolution brain imaging using diffusion MRI, a technique that maps the white matter tracts—essentially the brain’s wiring—connecting different regions. The researchers used a method called connectome-based predictive modeling, which relies on machine learning to identify patterns in the brain’s structural connectivity that relate to individual differences in behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This method allowed them to identify two kinds of networks: positive networks, where stronger connections were linked to higher psychopathy scores, and negative networks, where weaker connections were related to those same scores. They also tested whether specific connections within these networks helped explain the relationship between psychopathic traits and externalizing behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that psychopathic traits were significantly associated with both stronger and weaker connections in different parts of the brain. The positive network—made up of connections that increased with psychopathy—was better at predicting psychopathic traits than the negative network alone. But when both networks were combined, the prediction became even more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the connections in the positive network were located within the brain’s frontal and parietal lobes, which are involved in decision-making, emotional processing, and attention. These connections included pathways like the uncinate fasciculus, which links the frontal cortex with areas involved in emotion, and the arcuate fasciculus, which supports language and auditory processing. Other connections involved the cingulum bundle, associated with emotional regulation and social behavior, and the posterior corticostriatal pathway, which plays a role in reward processing and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the negative network involved fewer connections, notably in regions like the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus on the left side of the brain. These tracts are important for attention control and integrating information across different senses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then looked at whether specific connections in these networks could explain the link between psychopathic traits and externalizing behaviors. They found that one connection in the right hemisphere—part of a tract involved in emotion recognition—was associated with both psychopathy and higher levels of externalizing behavior. A second connection in the left hemisphere—related to attention control—was linked to both psychopathy and lower levels of these behaviors. Mediation analyses suggested that these two connections acted as pathways through which psychopathic traits might influence externalizing behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that structural differences in how the brain is connected may play a role in how psychopathic traits are expressed behaviorally. Some connections—especially those involved in emotion and reward processing—may contribute to difficulties in recognizing and responding to social and emotional cues, which could make aggressive or impulsive behaviors more likely. Other connections, especially those related to attention control, may affect a person’s ability to process competing information, potentially influencing how they respond in complex or emotionally charged situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the study found that people with higher psychopathic traits did not always show weaker brain connections. In fact, some brain networks showed increased connectivity. This is different from earlier findings that have mostly focused on reduced structural integrity in white matter. The current study used a different measurement—counting the number of streamlines between regions—which may capture broader patterns of connection rather than subtle changes in tissue structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also emphasized that the results support a dual-pathway model of psychopathy. One pathway involves problems with emotional processing, and the other involves attention control. These two types of brain circuits may work independently or together to influence how psychopathic traits are expressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings offer new insight into the brain’s role in psychopathy, there are several limitations. The participants in the study were young adults from the general population, and most had relatively low levels of externalizing behaviors. This limits how much the results can be applied to people with more severe or clinical forms of psychopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also did not include behavioral or cognitive tasks that could directly link the brain’s structural features to performance in real-world situations. Including such tasks in future studies could help clarify how these brain differences translate into specific deficits in emotional or attentional processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that the study treated psychopathy as a single dimension. But research suggests that different components of psychopathy—such as callousness versus impulsivity—may be linked to different brain circuits. Future studies could look at how structural connectivity relates to specific traits or subtypes of psychopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the study’s sample size was relatively small, and the findings need to be replicated in larger and more diverse populations, including those with higher levels of psychopathic traits or histories of criminal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.70158" target="_blank"&gt;The Role of Structural Brain Networks in Psychopathy and Its Relation to Externalizing Behaviors&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Peiyang Guo, Cheng Cheng, and Xiangyi Zhang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 20:20:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOa1RmT1dUN0xmWnpMalFZTU9vV3ZyMHA0UW9tTG12Y3lZWjU1blJBQW52S1diWnd3QVBFcG9VWmNmZG82dU1PZ0RzX0V1NXlfVTBTSG1Fa2s4bDUtWWE1VUhVeTRTVEZsYjFBSUN6SEJoVE10SFBvQmVQNkRSLWJ0dVI4UnNPbDNNQXpTd29fOWU4NHJ4anpHWVlZMWRJOUtabmkwWFBkRkEwbzQ</guid></item><item><title>据营养师介绍，最佳减肥高蛋白午餐- EatingWell | The Best High-Protein Lunch for Weight Loss, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxNYzV4UUxhaU5ZaXFXaExaeVAwSlJaeXQ0cXdvWkVKVGNaZC1hU2p2QUJWcWpXdGVzcVRzSFVRWjVXaHpKcU5CTVR4eXBhTnZseGpBVjg4cHpPZHlhVy1xOXNtV2VaYkp0dFh6T1hpSmpDa1dHVXQyVk1ka3lSUmM1Tg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This high-protein chicken salad sandwich provides energy and keeps you feeling full longer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tasty ingredients like Greek yogurt and sun-dried tomatoes make this healthy lunch fun and satisfying to eat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can enjoy this meal in different ways—on bread, in a salad or stuffed in veggies—so it never gets boring.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There may come a time in your life or that of a loved one where weight loss becomes a goal. It might have nothing to do with vanity, either. The emotional and physical toll of daily life can affect our health and weight. Whether it’s overeating as a way to cope with the loss of a job, or bingeing on junk food to manage the stress of taking care of family, we often turn to food for comfort. Luckily, there are strategies that can help you manage both your weight and your overall health. One of the best weight-loss strategies is choosing to enjoy &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7833555/top-nutrients-for-weight-loss/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;meals rich in nutrients&lt;/a&gt; that provide energy and promote satiety. One of my favorite lunch recipes that leans into that strategy is this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/marry-me-chicken-salad-sandwich-11687670" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Marry Me Chicken Salad Sandwich&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s why I think it’s the best lunch for weight loss.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-the-marry-me-chicken-salad-sandwich-is-the-best-lunch-for-weight-loss"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why the Marry Me Chicken Salad Sandwich Is the Best Lunch for Weight Loss &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s High in Protein &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One reason I love this lunch is that it’s packed with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-protein-and-its-benefits-11732679" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;. It provides more than 40 grams of protein per sandwich, thanks to the chicken and Greek yogurt. But why is protein so important for weight loss? &lt;a href="https://www.christywilsonnutrition.com/menu" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Christy Wilson, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, says, “When it comes to weight loss, protein helps keep us feeling full and satisfied long after we’ve eaten.”  Wilson cites a recent study where participants did lose weight when protein was 16% to 45% of total calories consumed. High-protein diets appeared to increase satiety and energy expenditure while improving body composition by increasing the amount of fat-free mass.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Ultra-Satisfying &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The protein makes the meal satisfying, but so does how it’s packaged. The chicken salad, for starters, is made with flavorful ingredients like tangy Greek yogurt and slightly sweet sun-dried tomatoes. There’s also the arugula, which adds color and a bright, peppery bite. Finally, the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8045858/whole-grain-bread-vs-whole-wheat-bread/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;whole-wheat bread provides texture&lt;/a&gt; as well as a variety of nutrients, including fiber, which benefits health and boosts satiety. Each bite is as delicious and satisfying as the next!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Can Be Enjoyed in a Variety of Ways &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I love meals that can be reinterpreted or modified for enjoyment in other ways. This chicken salad sandwich is one of those meals. For example, during the warmer summer months, I prefer to serve the chicken salad over lettuce and include other seasonal vegetables as part of the meal. In the fall and winter, I’ll enjoy it as a sandwich but swap the bread for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sourdough-or-whole-wheat-bread-better-for-gut-health-11771656" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sourdough or something whole-grain and hearty&lt;/a&gt; from my local bakery. Or I’ll stuff the chicken salad into a bell pepper and broil for a few minutes to enjoy it warm. Being able to reinvent the dish means I can enjoy it several ways without getting bored!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-things-to-do-to-help-support-weight-loss"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Things to Do to Help Support Weight Loss &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s important to consider the food you eat when it comes to weight loss, but there are other things you can do, even during lunchtime, to help. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enjoy your lunch with co-workers:&lt;/strong&gt; Eating by yourself or sitting at your desk staring at a screen is fine occasionally, but if you have the opportunity, I suggest &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8025502/cooking-and-eating-together-impact-your-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dining with co-workers&lt;/a&gt;. Sitting down and talking with people during your meal gives you an excuse to slow down and enjoy your food while enjoying the company of others. This is good for digestion as well as boosting your mood—both of which can help with weight loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take a walk:&lt;/strong&gt; Either before or after your lunch, consider going on a walk. The benefits of movement go beyond weight loss, as research has proven &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026823/what-is-joyful-movement/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;exercise makes you feel good&lt;/a&gt; and gives you energy. If a walk isn’t an option, consider finding some stairs to conquer, or just take a few laps around the office or your home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sip water:&lt;/strong&gt; Hydration plays a powerful role in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/does-drinking-water-help-you-lose-weight-11725115" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;weight management&lt;/a&gt;. That’s because the opposite, dehydration, can trick your mind into thinking you’re hungry versus thirsty. Good hydration means you’ll feel better too. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try a mindful reset: &lt;/strong&gt;Use your lunch break as a time to hit the mental “reset” button. Use a wellness app to find a quick mediation to help you relax or do some deep-breathing exercises to clear your mind. Taking a moment to center yourself can also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290947/mindful-eating-the-key-to-eating-what-you-want-and-fully-enjoying-it/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;prevent mindless eating&lt;/a&gt; or overeating and help you &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-habit-to-lose-weight-11766982" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;listen to your body’s cues for hunger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are plenty of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7893676/how-to-lose-weight-when-you-dont-know-where-to-start-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;strategies you can use when looking to lose weight&lt;/a&gt;. A great one is enjoying a lunch that’s delicious and satisfying. Choosing something high in protein that includes a variety of ingredients and textures is a great option, like my favorite Marry Me Chicken Salad Sandwich. But remember, it’s not the only way. Be sure to include movement and socialization time in your plan. Stay hydrated and carve out some time for a midday reset. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And remember, says &lt;a href="https://www.resetlifestyle.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Wintana Kiros, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;: While protein is the foundation that helps you feel full, preserves your muscle and keeps you strong during weight loss, you also need fiber-rich carbs, healthy fats and anti-inflammatory foods like colorful plants to bring balance. So don’t exclude these other foods, she says. “Think of protein as your anchor, not your entire ship.”&lt;br&gt;

Unless AMR programmes are protected from aid cuts, resistance rates across the world will likely increase at a rate in line with the worst-affected countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This would result in millions more people dying worldwide, including across G7 nations. Investing in treatment for bacterial infections now will save lives and deliver billions in long-term economic returns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The research calculated the economic and health burden of antibiotic resistance for 122 countries and forecast that in that in this most pessimistic scenario, by 2050, GDP losses in China could reach just under $722bn a year, the US $295.7bn, the EU $187bn, Japan $65.7bn and the UK $58.6bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.healthdata.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation&lt;/a&gt; (IHME), deaths from AMR are expected to increase 60% by 2050, with 1.34 million people in the US and 184,000 in the UK alone predicted to die each year from antibiotic resistant bugs, while numbers of those becoming seriously ill from drug-resistant bacteria are also expected to jump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Superbugs increase the number of hospital admissions and lead to longer and more intensive hospital stays, costlier second-line treatments and more complex care, meaning resistant infections are roughly twice as expensive to treat as those for which antibiotics are effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study estimates global health costs of treating AMR could increase by just under $176bn a year, while in the UK, they would rise from $900m to $3.7bn and in the US from $15.5bn to just under $57bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Higher rates of resistant bugs would also shrink the UK, EU and US workforces by 0.8%, 0.6% and 0.4% respectively, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But if countries invest more in tackling superbugs – increasing access to new antibiotics and high-quality treatment of these infections – the US economy would grow $156.2bn a year and the UK $12bn (£9.3bn) by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Responding to the findings, Dr Mohsen Naghavi, a professor of health metrics at IHME, said: “Today the threat of AMR is increasing, and without immediate action from all stakeholders the medicines we have access to now could stop working, potentially causing a simple infection to become deadly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;That would involve policy changes from the US, European and UK governments, the development of new drugs and ensuring everyone understood that antibiotics were ineffective against viruses, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A UK government spokesperson said: “Our 10-year health plan recognises antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as a major threat and commits to urgently tackle its spread, including through new vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We have made important progress - reducing antibiotic use in meat and pioneering a world-first subscription model to incentivise the development of new treatments. We also continue to work closely with international partners to influence global efforts to limit the spread of AMR.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 17:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxPcnlkbm41dnZxbVA4ZjhfRnk0c3U0b0NTbE4zTUk2VmhYQTRjWFl3QUVpX1I4WHlCS2VYNkhWN2Nrd0VKMkZWS1lPVjdnVEFJRFhua25VbGNXVEg2N2xrZEo2Sl9RWWxGajNqbmZlQnkwUkEtLUFkbVRlLU5nSWl3YkhXTHhNSnctNTlUOHl2aEIyYzlKMEVoalgxWWsyWmVBUGJCemtkN0hEZlNyRVdkalkteV91WURncThPM2g4VQ</guid></item><item><title>并非所有的人造甜味剂都对您有害，这也可能对抗癌症- Earth.com | Not all artificial sweeteners are bad for you, and this one might also fight cancer - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxPcC0wSkFyNno4TGlyXzFOZHJqWUkzWVR5VFM2WHNTZ1JZdDVDbVNONkFuVGZfaUticFk3ZHZUMGxEVlpjVzktOElDdWNzd0NuSWZEdVhxRUp0VUtHMnpXcC01Z0Y1bWpIaGppVjZlVUdLR1NjcU5YZEpLSUNfU2dVRlFqM0YxSTRDZmc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stevia may soon offer more than just sweetness. In the lab, researchers found that when fermented with a bacterium from banana leaves, this natural plant extract targets pancreatic cancer cells – while leaving healthy kidney cells unharmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Globally, the incidence and mortality rates of pancreatic cancer continue to rise, with a five-year survival rate of less than 10%,” said study co-author Narandalai Danshiitsoodol from &lt;a href="https://www.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hiroshima University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pancreatic cancer is highly invasive and prone to metastasis, showing significant resistance to existing treatments, such as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. As such, there is an urgent need to identify new and effective anticancer &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cancer-cells-create-power-waves-to-fuel-invasion/"&gt;compounds&lt;/a&gt;, particularly those derived from medicinal plants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fermented-stevia-for-cancer-therapy"&gt;Fermented stevia for cancer therapy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus plantarum&lt;/em&gt; SN13T, a bacterium from banana leaves. They fermented stevia leaves and compared the result to a regular extract. The fermented version (FSLE) worked better in every way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To enhance the pharmacological efficacy of natural plant extracts, microbial biotransformation has emerged as an effective strategy,” said Masanori Sugiyama. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this study, we aimed to compare LAB-fermented and non-fermented extracts to identify key compounds that enhance bioactivity, ultimately contributing to the efficacy of herbal medicine in cancer &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/walking-each-day-at-any-speed-lowers-the-risk-of-cancer/"&gt;prevention&lt;/a&gt; and therapy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers didn’t just mix things and hope. They optimized fermentation time, temperature, and oxygen levels. Stevia turned out to be most potent when fermented for 72 hours, without oxygen, at 37°C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fermented-stevia-hits-cancer-cells-hard"&gt;Fermented stevia hits cancer cells hard&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fermented stevia killed pancreatic cancer (PANC-1) cells more efficiently than the non-fermented extract. At the same time, it barely touched healthy HEK-293 cells, even at high doses. That balance is rare and valuable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At some concentrations, FSLE didn’t kill cancer cells immediately. Instead, it slowed their growth. The cancer &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-scientist-discovers-that-common-non-cancer-drugs-when-combined-can-kill-cancer-cells/"&gt;cells&lt;/a&gt; looked weak, lost shape, and stopped sticking together. Under the microscope, they looked scattered and unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy kidney cells stayed mostly unaffected. This points to selectivity – a key feature for safe treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-strong-antioxidant-effects"&gt;Strong antioxidant effects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer isn’t just about rogue cells. Oxidative stress plays a big role. Fermented stevia turned out to be a powerful antioxidant too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In lab tests, it neutralized free radicals more effectively than non-fermented extract. It hit 94% scavenging power in the DPPH assay and 75% in ABTS. Even when healthy cells were exposed to hydrogen peroxide, FSLE helped them survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fermentation likely created new compounds. The researchers suspect chlorogenic acid transformed into chlorogenic acid methyl ester (CAME), a more active form. Fermented stevia contained lots of it. The raw extract had none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-powerful-compound-fights-cancer-cells"&gt;Powerful compound fights cancer cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAME packed more punch than chlorogenic acid. It stopped cancer cell growth and triggered their self-destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its IC50 – the dose that kills half the cancer &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/breakthrough-cancer-cells-have-a-molecular-switch-that-could-be-rewired-to-behave-normally/"&gt;cells&lt;/a&gt; – was just 119.1 µg/mL. For regular chlorogenic acid, it was 189.6 µg/mL. That’s a big difference. CAME shut down cancer cells by blocking their cell cycle and making them commit apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flow cytometry showed CAME, produced by fermented stevia, locked the cells in the G0/G1 phase. That’s the stage before a cell starts duplicating. It also caused the cells to release cytochrome c and activate caspases, which break down dying cells from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-altered-gene-activity"&gt;Altered gene activity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the gene level, things got interesting. CAME dialed up pro-apoptotic genes like Bax, Bad, Caspase-3, Caspase-9, and Cytochrome c. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compound also boosted E-cadherin, a gene linked to reduced cancer migration. Meanwhile, it shut down Bcl-2, a gene that normally stops cells from dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This gene activity supports what the microscope and assays showed. The cells didn’t just die randomly. CAME pushed them into a specific self-destruct mode, the mitochondrial pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stevia-more-than-just-a-sweetener"&gt;Stevia: More than just a sweetener&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fermentation changed the story. It gave stevia extract a new weapon – a compound that targets &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/light-activated-molecules-kill-cancer-cells-with-precision/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; while keeping healthy cells safe. That transformation seems to happen through specific enzymes from the SN13T strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This microbial transformation was likely due to specific enzymes in the bacteria strain used,” Danshiitsoodol said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our data demonstrate that CAME exhibits stronger toxicity to cells and pro-apoptotic effects – which encourage cell death – on PANC-1 cells compared to chlorogenic acid alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-upcoming-cancer-research-with-stevia"&gt;Upcoming cancer research with stevia &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team plans to move beyond the lab dish. Mouse studies come next. That will show whether fermented stevia works in living systems with real immune responses and complex metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The present study has substantially enhanced our understanding of the mechanism of action of the Lactobacillus plantarum SN13T strain in the fermentation of herbal extracts, while also offering a valuable research perspective on the potential application of probiotics as natural anti-tumor agents,” said Danshiitsoodol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research suggests that with the right microbes, even a simple leaf can evolve into a targeted therapy.

But lurking beneath all these headlines and gripes lies a stubborn, unshakable fact: in 2025, Americans simply don’t live as long as citizens in dozens of other high-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re an average American baby born this year, you’re expected to live about 78 years. That sounds fine, maybe even good to some ears, but step outside US borders even just over to Canada or across the United Kingdom and it’s abundantly clear: Americans are living shorter lives than almost all their economic peers and, frankly, than millions of people in less wealthy parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what’s going on? Let’s take a look into what the latest data tells us about American longevity—and why, for all the tech innovations and world-class medical centers dotting the landscape, life expectancy here just keeps stagnating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does &lt;keyword id="3932708" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="US-life-expectancy" source="Orion"&gt;US life expectancy&lt;/keyword&gt; measure up?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First things first: life expectancy is the average number of years a newborn can expect to live under current mortality rates. In the US, that number hit a recent low after COVID-19 but has since bounced back a bit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, it’s not keeping pace with history—or with the rest of the developed world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2023 US life expectancy: 78.4 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Global Average (2025): 73.5 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ranking: 48th globally (and slipping)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the kicker: the US is above the global average, but a few years below its “peer” nations. Most of Western Europe, plus Japan, Australia, South Korea, and even some smaller nations like Monaco, enjoy life expectancies between 82 and 87 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans are on average living about 3–5 years less than their economic peers, and as much as 8 years less than the world leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the numbers really say&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes the latest stats for the US:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both sexes: 78.4 years (2023 data)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Males: 75.8 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Females: 81.1 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, Canada, France, Japan, and even the UK all clock in well above the US average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO (World Health Organization) data lines up: no matter which authority you check, the trend is the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;America’s rank in the longevity league&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So where does that put the US? In 48th place (as per several reports) and, according to the latest forecasts by World Population Review, likely to drop even further down the list by 2050. Other wealthy nations, meanwhile, continue to inch higher, sometimes gaining years while the US just creeps forward months at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peer nations growing faster: For example, Japan, Korea, Portugal, the UK, and Italy already clock in at 80+ years and counting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;US trend is stagnating: Some projections put the US at 80.4 years—in 2050. That’s nearly a quarter-century just to gain a single year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is the US lagging behind?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you spent any time in a US health economics classroom, you might echo this refrain: Americans spend more—way more—on healthcare than anyone else, but live shorter lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s where things get sticky (and let’s be real, infuriating). According to the CDC and public health research, several chronic and acute challenges conspire to keep US life expectancy low:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cardiovascular disease and obesity: Rates here dwarf those in peer nations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diabetes: A chronic and costly epidemic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Diseases of despair": Suicide, alcoholism, and drug overdoses hit the US particularly hard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maternal and infant mortality: Above-average for a wealthy nation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Motor vehicle fatalities: Still shockingly high.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthcare disparity: Insurance rates, cost barriers, and uneven healthcare access.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Socioeconomic inequality: Health outcomes dramatically vary by income, ZIP code, and racial group.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans are living shorter, sicker lives even as the country outspends rivals on everything from advanced surgeries to high-end drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Comparing to the UK and peers: A stark gap&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s pause and zero in on a particularly telling comparison: the United States vs. the United Kingdom. Recent investigative reports by Johns Hopkins’ Bloomberg School of Public Health deliver this sobering headline: Americans live years less than the Brits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading causes of excess US deaths: Heart disease, drug overdoses, infant and maternal deaths&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What really stands out isn’t just the small year-by-year difference. It’s the long-term trend: since the 1980s, America’s trajectory has flatlined, while Europe trudges upward—even through its own crises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy differences: Universal coverage, safety nets, and regenerative social programs in the UK and Europe often make healthier choices easier and provide fallback care when disaster strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health investment: The UK spends less on care, but more on prevention and community wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Digging into health habits and policy differences&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for “silver bullet” explanations, the data won’t cut you any slack. It’s death by a thousand small problems, and they’re entangled:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diet: Appallingly high processed food consumption, sugar-sweetened beverages, and ultra-processed snacks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exercise: Sedentary lifestyles prevail, especially among kids and teens.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Addiction: A toxic brew of widespread opioid, meth, and alcohol abuse. Overdose rates have reached devastating levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mental health: Underfunded and stigmatized, pushing more people into crisis and self-harm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthcare Coverage: Insurance gaps, high out-of-pocket costs, and rural hospital closures remain endemic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Environmental factors: Pockets of heavy pollution and “food deserts.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the CDC points out, even American children today face a 1-in-5 shot at developing obesity before adulthood, foreshadowing future medical costs and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What would it take for America to catch up?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts and studies converge on a short list of must-dos:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tackle chronic disease: Expand access to preventive screening, healthy foods, and physical activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Address the opioid crisis: Investment in mental health and addiction treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make healthcare universal and affordable: Reduce insurance and cost barriers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maternal and infant health: More prenatal care, family leave, and education.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tackle poverty and inequality: Social safety nets, fair wages, and safer housing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without bolder national action—and strong local follow-through—these gains will remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;America’s health gap is no longer a technical problem; it’s a political, social, and moral one.

But lurking beneath all these headlines and gripes lies a stubborn, unshakable fact: in 2025, Americans simply don’t live as long as citizens in dozens of other high-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re an average American baby born this year, you’re expected to live about 78 years. That sounds fine, maybe even good to some ears, but step outside US borders even just over to Canada or across the United Kingdom and it’s abundantly clear: Americans are living shorter lives than almost all their economic peers and, frankly, than millions of people in less wealthy parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what’s going on? Let’s take a look into what the latest data tells us about American longevity—and why, for all the tech innovations and world-class medical centers dotting the landscape, life expectancy here just keeps stagnating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does &lt;keyword id="3932708" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="US-life-expectancy" source="Orion"&gt;US life expectancy&lt;/keyword&gt; measure up?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First things first: life expectancy is the average number of years a newborn can expect to live under current mortality rates. In the US, that number hit a recent low after COVID-19 but has since bounced back a bit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, it’s not keeping pace with history—or with the rest of the developed world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2023 US life expectancy: 78.4 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Global Average (2025): 73.5 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ranking: 48th globally (and slipping)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the kicker: the US is above the global average, but a few years below its “peer” nations. Most of Western Europe, plus Japan, Australia, South Korea, and even some smaller nations like Monaco, enjoy life expectancies between 82 and 87 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans are on average living about 3–5 years less than their economic peers, and as much as 8 years less than the world leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the numbers really say&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes the latest stats for the US:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both sexes: 78.4 years (2023 data)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Males: 75.8 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Females: 81.1 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, Canada, France, Japan, and even the UK all clock in well above the US average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO (World Health Organization) data lines up: no matter which authority you check, the trend is the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;America’s rank in the longevity league&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So where does that put the US? In 48th place (as per several reports) and, according to the latest forecasts by World Population Review, likely to drop even further down the list by 2050. Other wealthy nations, meanwhile, continue to inch higher, sometimes gaining years while the US just creeps forward months at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peer nations growing faster: For example, Japan, Korea, Portugal, the UK, and Italy already clock in at 80+ years and counting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;US trend is stagnating: Some projections put the US at 80.4 years—in 2050. That’s nearly a quarter-century just to gain a single year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is the US lagging behind?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you spent any time in a US health economics classroom, you might echo this refrain: Americans spend more—way more—on healthcare than anyone else, but live shorter lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s where things get sticky (and let’s be real, infuriating). According to the CDC and public health research, several chronic and acute challenges conspire to keep US life expectancy low:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cardiovascular disease and obesity: Rates here dwarf those in peer nations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diabetes: A chronic and costly epidemic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Diseases of despair": Suicide, alcoholism, and drug overdoses hit the US particularly hard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maternal and infant mortality: Above-average for a wealthy nation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Motor vehicle fatalities: Still shockingly high.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthcare disparity: Insurance rates, cost barriers, and uneven healthcare access.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Socioeconomic inequality: Health outcomes dramatically vary by income, ZIP code, and racial group.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans are living shorter, sicker lives even as the country outspends rivals on everything from advanced surgeries to high-end drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Comparing to the UK and peers: A stark gap&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s pause and zero in on a particularly telling comparison: the United States vs. the United Kingdom. Recent investigative reports by Johns Hopkins’ Bloomberg School of Public Health deliver this sobering headline: Americans live years less than the Brits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading causes of excess US deaths: Heart disease, drug overdoses, infant and maternal deaths&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What really stands out isn’t just the small year-by-year difference. It’s the long-term trend: since the 1980s, America’s trajectory has flatlined, while Europe trudges upward—even through its own crises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy differences: Universal coverage, safety nets, and regenerative social programs in the UK and Europe often make healthier choices easier and provide fallback care when disaster strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health investment: The UK spends less on care, but more on prevention and community wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Digging into health habits and policy differences&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for “silver bullet” explanations, the data won’t cut you any slack. It’s death by a thousand small problems, and they’re entangled:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diet: Appallingly high processed food consumption, sugar-sweetened beverages, and ultra-processed snacks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exercise: Sedentary lifestyles prevail, especially among kids and teens.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Addiction: A toxic brew of widespread opioid, meth, and alcohol abuse. Overdose rates have reached devastating levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mental health: Underfunded and stigmatized, pushing more people into crisis and self-harm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthcare Coverage: Insurance gaps, high out-of-pocket costs, and rural hospital closures remain endemic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Environmental factors: Pockets of heavy pollution and “food deserts.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the CDC points out, even American children today face a 1-in-5 shot at developing obesity before adulthood, foreshadowing future medical costs and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What would it take for America to catch up?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts and studies converge on a short list of must-dos:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tackle chronic disease: Expand access to preventive screening, healthy foods, and physical activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Address the opioid crisis: Investment in mental health and addiction treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make healthcare universal and affordable: Reduce insurance and cost barriers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maternal and infant health: More prenatal care, family leave, and education.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tackle poverty and inequality: Social safety nets, fair wages, and safer housing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without bolder national action—and strong local follow-through—these gains will remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;America’s health gap is no longer a technical problem; it’s a political, social, and moral one. Other countries have shown it’s fixable, but it takes serious willpower and the humility to learn from others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question for the next generation, then, is simple: Will we keep coasting along on what’s left of the old American advantage, or finally tackle the causes behind our shorter lives?

It also depends on how you measure sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/losing-just-one-nights-sleep-changes-your-immune-system-study-finds?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Losing Just One Night's Sleep Changes Your Immune System, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168370" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168370" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/WomenCoveringEyesFromLightInDarkBed-e1752798905748.jpg" alt="Woman covering eyes from light shining on dark bed" class="wp-image-168370 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168370" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Extra social demands on women do not help. (skynesher/E+/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the evidence say?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers usually measure sleep in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by asking people how much they sleep (known as self-reporting). But people are &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/41/6/zsy057/4986872"&gt;surprisingly inaccurate&lt;/a&gt; at estimating how much sleep they get&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using objective tools, such as research-grade, wearable sleep trackers or the gold-standard polysomnography, which records brain waves, breathing and movement while you sleep during a sleep study in a lab or clinic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the objective data, well-conducted studies usually show women sleep about 20 minutes more than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One global study of nearly 70,000 people who wore wearable sleep trackers found a consistent, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/44/2/zsaa169/5901589?login=false"&gt;small difference&lt;/a&gt; between men and women across age groups. For example, the sleep difference between men and women aged 40–44 was about 23–29 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another large study using polysomnography found women slept &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/216692"&gt;about 19 minutes longer&lt;/a&gt; than men. In this study, women also spent more time in deep sleep: about 23 percent of the night compared to about 14 percent for men. The study also found only men's quality of sleep declined with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key caveat to these findings is that our individual sleep needs vary considerably. Women may sleep slightly more on average, just as they are slightly shorter on average. But there is no one-size-fits-all sleep duration, just as there is no universal height.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suggesting every woman needs 20 extra minutes (let alone two hours) misses the point. It's the same as insisting all women should be shorter than all men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though women tend to sleep a little longer and deeper, they consistently report &lt;a href="https://www.scielosp.org/article/gs/2017.v31n1/18-22/en/?uid=fe7f4167s16"&gt;poorer sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;. They're also about &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/29/1/85/2708069"&gt;40 percent more likely&lt;/a&gt; to be diagnosed with insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mismatch between lab findings and the real world is a well-known puzzle in sleep research, and there are many reasons for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, many research studies don't consider mental health problems, medications, alcohol use and hormonal fluctuations. This filters out the very factors that shape sleep in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mismatch between the lab and the bedroom also reminds us &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/45/10/zsac187/6668259"&gt;sleep doesn't happen in a vacuum&lt;/a&gt;. Women's sleep is shaped by a complex mix of biological, psychological and social factors, and this complexity is hard to capture in individual studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Let's start with biology&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep problems &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0369811414001199"&gt;begin to diverge&lt;/a&gt; between the sexes around puberty. They spike again during pregnancy, after birth and during perimenopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fluctuating levels of ovarian hormones, particularly estrogen and progesterone, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0369811414001199"&gt;seem to explain&lt;/a&gt; some of these sex differences in sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, many girls and women report poorer sleep &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022399903000679"&gt;during the premenstrual phase&lt;/a&gt; just before their periods, when estrogen and progesterone begin to fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most well-documented hormonal influence on our sleep is the decline in estrogen during perimenopause. This is linked to increased sleep disturbances, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0369811414001199#bib0440"&gt;particularly waking at 3am&lt;/a&gt; and struggling to get back to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some health conditions also play a part in women's sleep health. &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-72102-6_6"&gt;Thyroid disorders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.hematology.org/education/patients/anemia/iron-deficiency"&gt;iron deficiency&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, are more common in women and are closely linked to &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12875-016-0545-5"&gt;fatigue and disrupted sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How about psychology?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women are at &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(16)30358-3/abstract"&gt;much higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="168360" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, anxiety and trauma-related disorders. These very often &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369209603226"&gt;accompany sleep problems and fatigue&lt;/a&gt;. Cognitive patterns, such as worry and rumination, are also more common in women and &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15402002.2015.1083022"&gt;known to affect sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women are also prescribed &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bjpsych-open/article/antidepressant-prescribing-patterns-in-australia/08E1231DAE09B29D4BDCB24248A9D968"&gt;antidepressants more often&lt;/a&gt; than men, and these medications tend to &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1744-6163.2009.00221.x"&gt;affect sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Society also plays a role&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caregiving and emotional labour still fall disproportionately on women. Government data released this year suggests Australian women perform an average &lt;a href="https://genderequality.gov.au/status-women-report-cards/2025-report-card"&gt;nine more hours of unpaid care and work each week&lt;/a&gt; than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many women manage to put enough time aside for sleep, their opportunities for daytime rest are often scarce. This puts a lot of pressure on sleep to deliver all the restoration women need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my work with patients, we often untangle the threads woven into their experience of fatigue. While poor sleep is the obvious culprit, fatigue can also signal something deeper, such as underlying health issues, emotional strain, or too-high expectations of themselves. Sleep is certainly part of the picture, but it's rarely the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, rates of iron deficiency (which we know is &lt;a href="https://www.hematology.org/education/patients/anemia/iron-deficiency"&gt;more common&lt;/a&gt; in women and linked to sleep problems) are also higher &lt;a href="https://www.hematology.org/education/patients/anemia/iron-deficiency"&gt;in the reproductive years&lt;/a&gt;. This is just as many women are raising children and grappling with the "juggle" and the "mental load".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women in perimenopause &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5259896"&gt;are often navigating&lt;/a&gt; full-time work, teenagers, ageing parents and 3am hot flashes. These women may have adequate or even high-quality sleep (according to objective measures), but that doesn't mean they wake feeling restored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most existing research also ignores gender-diverse populations. This limits our understanding of how sleep is shaped not just by biology, but by things such as identity and social context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So where does this leave us?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While women sleep longer and better in the lab, they face more barriers to feeling rested in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, do women need more sleep than men? On average, yes, a little. But more importantly, women need more support and opportunity to recharge and recover across the day, and at night.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/259985/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Beef gets a bad rap. Yes, red meat is high in saturated fat and if eaten in excess it can increase the risk for heart disease and contribute to issues like obesity, cancer, and diabetes. But beef is also a great source of protein and iron, and it can contribute to a healthy diet if you choose the right type and limit your intake to three portions per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The key is buying lean cuts, which contain less than 10 grams of fat per serving. &lt;a href="http://foodmysteries.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Registered Dietitian Angel Luk&lt;/a&gt; recommends looking for options with the least amount of saturated fat. "The amount of saturated fat is an important consideration for people living with high cholesterol," she says. "Generally speaking, aiming for less than 16 grams of saturated fat a day is a heart healthy approach. Lean cuts of red meat, such as round, sirloin, or loin, are lower in saturated fat and can be part of a healthy diet, providing important nutrients such as iron, zinc, B vitamins and protein." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Beef can only be labeled as lean if it complies with the regulations set by the USDA, so check the package for the special marking. It's different from the grading label producers use (for example, when you see a cut marked as "Prime" or "Select"), which has to do with marbling. The key words you're looking for are "lean" or "extra-lean". You can ask your butcher for a &lt;a href="https://www.tastingtable.com/695592/steak-guide-cuts-types/" target="_blank"&gt;guide to different cuts&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;
                    &lt;span class="gallery-image-credit"&gt;Andrey Starostin/Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;While marbling leads to delicious flavor, unfortunately, it does not contribute to a healthy heart. Prime doesn't equal lean, so even the most expensive T-bone and porterhouse steaks should be avoided. Go for Choice and Select cuts, which are typically cheaper. "Select beef tends to be the leanest," Luk explains, "making it a better choice for people opting for red meat as part of their saturated fat 'budget.'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Some lean cuts include chuck roast, shoulder roast, and arm roast, which all benefit from slow cooking. You can &lt;a href="https://www.tastingtable.com/1719052/how-to-smoke-chuck-roast/" target="_blank"&gt;smoke chuck roast&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.tastingtable.com/1772550/how-long-cook-pot-roast-oven-tender/" target="_blank"&gt;cook a pot roast in the oven &lt;/a&gt;with any option. As for steak, sirloin tip side is the leanest option, with just five grams of fat per serving, but top sirloin makes for an &lt;a href="https://www.tastingtable.com/1421551/tips-cook-sirloin-steak-juicy-tender/" target="_blank"&gt;unbelievably juicy steak&lt;/a&gt;. Anything with less than five grams of fat is considered extra-lean by the USDA, and if you can get something organic or grass-fed, even better. As for ground beef, look for the lowest fat percentage you can find, like 95% lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The big thing to really avoid is anything that is ultra-processed. "Ultra processed beef such as hot dogs and sausages, and cuts with high amounts of saturated fat like ribeye with a lot of visible marbling are the least healthy," Luk suggests. You can treat yourself once in a while, but if you want to watch things, make sure it's lean beef in your rotation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

In the Amish kids, it’s probably 1 to 2 percent,” said Carole Ober, chair of human genetics at the University of Chicago. “A few of them do have allergies, but at much, much lower rates compared to the general population.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter | align_items_center border_bottom border_gray border_top border_1 container font_primary width_full margin_vertical_32 padding_vertical_24 is_article"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter_cta | border_box width_full no_image"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter_grid newsletter_grid--1"&gt;&lt;span class="title | bold font_secondary margin_bottom"&gt;Get Starting Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter_grid newsletter_grid--2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter_grid newsletter_grid--3"&gt;&lt;span class="newsletter_widget_description"&gt;A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Now, Ober and other researchers are trying to discover what makes Amish and other traditional farming communities unique, in the hopes of developing a protective treatment that could be given to young children. For instance, a probiotic or essential oil that contains substances found in farm dust, such as microbes and the molecules they produce, could stimulate children’s immune systems in a way that prevents allergic disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Certain kinds of farming practices, particularly the very traditional ones, have this extraordinary protective effect in the sense that, in these communities, asthma and allergies are virtually unknown,” said Donata Vercelli, a professor of cellular and molecular medicine at the University of Arizona. “The studies that have been done in these farming populations are critical because they tell us that protection is an attainable goal.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The Amish are members of a Christian group who practice traditional farming - many live on single-family dairy farms - and use horses for fieldwork and transportation. As of 2024, around 395,000 Amish live in the United States, concentrated mostly in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Over the past century, the incidence of allergic diseases - including hay fever (allergic rhinitis), asthma, food allergies and eczema - has increased dramatically. Hay fever, or an allergic reaction to tree, grass and weed pollens, emerged as the first recognized allergic disease in the early 1800s, climbing to epidemic levels in Europe and North America by 1900.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The 1960s saw a sharp increase in the prevalence of pediatric asthma, a condition in which the airways tighten when breathing in an allergen. From the 1990s onward, there has been an upswing in the developed world in food allergies, including cow’s milk, peanut and egg allergies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Urbanization, air pollution, dietary changes and an indoor lifestyle are often cited as possible factors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

Strachan wondered whether unhygienic contact with older siblings served as a protection against allergies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Subsequent findings have given support to the hygiene hypothesis, such as that children who grow up with more household pets are less likely to develop asthma, hay fever or eczema. Perhaps even more beneficial than having older siblings or pets, however, is growing up on a farm. (More than 150 years ago, hay fever was known as an “aristocratic disease,” almost wholly confined to the upper classes of society. Farmers appeared relatively immune.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;This “farm effect” has been confirmed by studies on agricultural populations around the world, including in the United States, Europe, Asia and South America. But even among farming communities, the most pronounced effect appears to be in the Amish. In a study of 60 schoolchildren by Ober, Vercelli and their colleagues, the prevalence of asthma was four times lower in the Amish as compared with the Hutterites, another U.S. farming community with a similar genetic ancestry and lifestyle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The prevalence of allergic sensitization - the development of antibodies to allergens and the first step to developing an allergy - was six times higher in the Hutterites. The researchers first ruled out a genetic cause; in fact, an analysis showed that the Amish and Hutterite children were remarkably similar in their ancestral roots. Instead, the main difference between these two populations seemed to be the amount of exposure as young children to farm animals or barns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The Hutterite kids and pregnant moms don’t go into the animal barns. Kids aren’t really exposed to the animal barns until they’re like 12 or so, when they start learning how to do the work on the farm,” Ober said. “The Amish kids are in and out of the cow barns all day long from an early age.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;When analyzing samples of Amish and Hutterite house dust, they found a microbial load almost seven times higher in Amish homes. Later experiments showed that the airways of mice that inhaled Amish dust had dramatically reduced asthmalike symptoms when exposed to allergens. Mice that inhaled Hutterite dust did not receive the same benefit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

In 2023, their analysis of farm dust found proteins that act like delivery trucks, loaded with molecules produced by microbes and plants. When these transport proteins deliver their cargo to the mucus that lines the respiratory tract, it creates a protective environment that regulates airway responses and prevents inflammation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We don’t really talk about the hygiene hypothesis as much anymore because we now understand that it’s not really about how hygienic you’re living,” said Kirsi Järvinen-Seppo, director of the Center for Food Allergy at the University of Rochester Medical Center. “It’s more like a microbial hypothesis, since beneficial bacteria that colonize the gut and other mucosal surfaces play a significant role.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;During the first year or two of life, a baby’s immune system is rapidly developing and highly malleable by environmental stimuli, such as bacteria. Some experts believe that exposing young children to certain types of beneficial bacteria can engage and shape the growing immune system in a way that reduces the risk of allergic diseases later in life. Farm dust contains a hodgepodge of bacteria shed from livestock and animal feed that isn’t harmful enough to cause illness, but does effectively train the immune system to become less responsive to allergens later in life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In 2021, Järvinen-Seppo and her colleagues compared the gut microbiomes of 65 Old Order Mennonite infants from a rural community in New York with 39 urban/suburban infants from nearby Rochester. Like the Amish, the Old Order Mennonites follow a traditional agrarian lifestyle. Almost three-fourths of Mennonite infants in the study were colonized with B. infantis, a bacterium associated with lower rates of allergic diseases, in contrast to 21 percent of Rochester infants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The colonization rate is very low in the United States and other Western countries, compared to very high rates in Mennonite communities, similar to some developing countries,” Järvinen-Seppo said. “This mirrors the rates of autoimmune and allergic diseases.” These clues about the origin of the farm effect represent a step toward the prevention of allergic diseases, Järvinen-Seppo says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Whatever form the treatment takes, the impact on prevention of allergic diseases, which affect millions of people worldwide and reduce quality of life, could be enormous, experts say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I don’t know that we can give every family a cow. … But we are learning from these time-honored and very stable environments what type of substances and exposures are needed,” Vercelli said. “Once we know that, I don’t think there will be any impediment to creating protective strategies along these lines.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Boston Globe</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 14:56:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxNdzFUNFBUVldHN3VMT1NPQ2dlcTdrV3Y5MVQ1UllsYnY0N3U5azUycUZGam9iTVdKOTlteHI0MVY2WDF3bGdKWlZxZ181T2hxMTdCbnZSYUI0MXhmcGdMNUpHUVRPZnFmRjJkZnB1UUFtUms2UzNxamVteHg1UDUzNExBSVI1amotdHFlTTlleXpfMWNPMlFBQ1RtdUtUZGFMSV9YRkhxSQ</guid></item><item><title>这种看似“完美的饮食”可能是您情绪低落的原因- Earth.com | This seemingly 'perfect diet' could be the cause of your emotional slumps - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxPY2piOGp2UldJcXdIOGNtMFNicTVoVGlwLW5SOTJFRWtOT0VEWTBIQTBaWEhOUWZ0RUFrTkc3YVpTZHl2Wml0NDlOSTRmZ2szQzFCNGl4OXhCRy1IdGNORGJSRDNIVlJTX3RzQnNuX08zMFBFS2tDQXhnNTZCOWxwbEhMaC1kX2l5Y18wam5fMkNXX1gtTXJpMG55XzZCdTVla3BqcUt0VWZJNmdCZXplanVWMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people assume that trimming calories, skipping snacks, and sticking to salads will slim the waistline and lift the mood. Yet depression already affects about eight percent of U.S. adults each year, and new data suggest that dieting could make that burden heavier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large U.S. survey now links calorie‑restricted diets with higher scores on the &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/fastlab/research/imapp/msrs/_jcr_content/main/accordion/accordion_content3/download_256324296/file.res/PHQ9%20id%20date%2008.03.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PHQ‑9&lt;/a&gt; depression questionnaire, especially in men and in anyone carrying extra weight. The work was led by psychiatrist Dr. Gabriella Menniti at the &lt;a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/"&gt;University of Toronto&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-link-between-calories-and-mood"&gt;Link between calories and mood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis pooled answers from 28,525 adults who described what and why they ate during six rounds of the National Health and Nutrition Examination &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Survey&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two thousand of them, about eight percent, flagged enough depressive symptoms to meet a clinical cutoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who reported limiting overall calories registered depression scores almost one‑third of a point higher than similar adults who were not dieting. That margin sounds small but was consistent across income, age, and ethnic subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men who counted calories fared worse than &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/gym-phobia-the-hidden-workout-hurdles-faced-by-women/"&gt;women&lt;/a&gt;, posting higher somatic complaints such as fatigue and sleep trouble. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overweight participants who slashed calories from carbs or fat also showed larger mood dips than their weight‑stable peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-men-carry-a-different-risk"&gt;Men carry a different risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nutrition scientists suspect that male biology raises the bar for minimum nutrient needs. Adult men generally require more protein, iron, and several B‑vitamins simply to maintain lean tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When those inputs fall short, energy metabolism slows, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10788288/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mood‑regulating chemicals&lt;/a&gt; like serotonin may sag, increasing the odds of irritability and flat affect. The research team saw this pattern even after adjusting for income, education, and physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Diets low in carbohydrates or fats may theoretically worsen brain function and exacerbate cognitive‑affective symptoms, especially in men with greater nutritional needs,” noted Dr. Menniti. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-weight-matters-more-than-willpower"&gt;Weight matters more than willpower&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrying extra body mass can mask nutrient shortfalls because fat tissue stores &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/can-caloric-restriction-help-you-live-longer-its-complicated/"&gt;calories&lt;/a&gt;, not vitamins. Overweight dieters often cut portions without adjusting food quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That mismatch may create a loop where weight barely shifts but micronutrient levels tumble, undercutting motivation and generating disappointment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing calories may thus result in mood slumps that can sabotage adherence before metabolic gains appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the survey, the link between calorie cutting and low mood was strongest among adults with body mass index values between 25 and 30. The authors suggest that expectations, failed or delayed, may magnify emotional cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mood-swings-and-calorie-cuts"&gt;Mood swings and calorie cuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain burns about twenty percent of daily energy yet relies almost exclusively on glucose for that supply. Severe decreases in blood sugar impair attention within minutes and can magnify anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutting carbohydrates to meet weight‑loss goals can therefore leave neurons underfed long before the scale budges. That shortfall is often misread as laziness or lack of discipline rather than a biochemical SOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fats matter as well. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9962071/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Omega‑3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; help build cell membranes and regulate inflammation, and low seafood intake has been linked to mood disorders in multiple trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplement studies are mixed, yet people who start with the lowest omega‑3 levels seem to benefit the most. This pattern suggests that deficiency, not dosage, drives the mood signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-micronutrients-hide-in-plain-sight"&gt;Micronutrients hide in plain sight&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin B12 supports the methylation reactions that produce dopamine and serotonin. Observational work finds that adults with low B12 levels score higher on depression scales even after accounting for income and alcohol use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iron paints a similar picture, with recent &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10175994/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NHANES&lt;/a&gt; analyses showing more depressive symptoms in men who test low for ferritin. The deficit can sap energy and flatten motivation within days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restrictive calorie plans that cut red meat, eggs, or fortified cereals can nudge both nutrients below recommended thresholds within weeks. Mood changes often surface before lab tests flag anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-balancing-calories-and-mood"&gt;Balancing calories and mood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dieticians usually recommend filling half the plate with colorful produce, a quarter with lean protein, and the rest with whole grains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That template &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-enough-fiber-prevents-cancer-in-a-surprising-way/"&gt;supplies fiber&lt;/a&gt; for gut bacteria, amino acids for neurotransmitters, and slow‑burn starch for stable &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/squats-vs-walking-the-definitive-winner-for-reducing-blood-sugar/"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding two servings of fatty fish per week or a daily handful of walnuts covers omega‑3s without extra pills. Vitamin‑B12‑rich foods like yogurt or fortified plant milks close common gaps for anyone skipping meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For weight management, experts advise shaving no more than five hundred &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/toddlers-get-half-their-calories-from-ultra-processed-foods/"&gt;calories&lt;/a&gt; off daily needs. Slower loss keeps micronutrient density intact and reduces cravings that torpedo adherence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cut-calories-gradually"&gt;Cut calories gradually&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracking mood alongside meals can be as simple as jotting one word like “flat” or “energized” next to dinner entries in a phone app. Over a week patterns emerge that tell more than any food label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If low energy always follows days under 1,800 calories, that data acts like a check‑engine light. The fix may be a small dose of complex carbs rather than abandoning the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/want-to-slow-down-aging-add-these-foods-to-your-diet/"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt; altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health professionals often remind clients that food is information, not just fuel. Sending the right signal takes mindful tweaks, not monastic austerity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small, sustainable changes compound faster than any crash diet. Your brain, as well as your belt, will notice the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://nutrition.bmj.com/content/early/2025/05/28/bmjnph-2025-001167.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMJ Nutrition, Prevention &amp;amp; Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 13:48:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxPY2piOGp2UldJcXdIOGNtMFNicTVoVGlwLW5SOTJFRWtOT0VEWTBIQTBaWEhOUWZ0RUFrTkc3YVpTZHl2Wml0NDlOSTRmZ2szQzFCNGl4OXhCRy1IdGNORGJSRDNIVlJTX3RzQnNuX08zMFBFS2tDQXhnNTZCOWxwbEhMaC1kX2l5Y18wam5fMkNXX1gtTXJpMG55XzZCdTVla3BqcUt0VWZJNmdCZXplanVWMA</guid></item><item><title>英国卫生服务AI工具为患者生成了一组虚假诊断- Fortune | UK health service AI tool generated a set of false diagnoses for a patient - Fortune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFBVV95cUxPSkR6NjVFR0JrSzRPdFVRXzBONFdYWHpjNDRXS1RtRUpoYWlkSnlyX0x4QjVETEVtT2xYOXl6VEZLRHp5QmY1eFNydmo3d0x4eWdlVU1ZVlFYWWRseF95THBtQTlSZFdKTmh6TXhMWEZUekxieDVUWXhTTW10SjlfOU5mNTVMMW81WEcwdlZyQnE0WGhDSnBYVlRBd0hsNy0wazZPRUNsZHFiZlU2ZjJyWXExeUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI use in healthcare has the potential to save time, money, and lives. But when technology that is known to &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2025/06/29/ai-lies-schemes-threats-stress-testing-claude-openai-chatgpt/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2025/06/29/ai-lies-schemes-threats-stress-testing-claude-openai-chatgpt/" class="sc-19cc8fd2-0 iHosVH"&gt;occasionally lie&lt;/a&gt; is introduced into patient care, it also raises serious risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="paywall"&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One London-based patient recently experienced just how serious those risks can be after receiving a letter inviting him to a diabetic eye screening—a standard &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/tests-and-treatments/diabetic-eye-screening/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.nhs.uk/tests-and-treatments/diabetic-eye-screening/" class="sc-19cc8fd2-0 iHosVH"&gt;annual check-up &lt;/a&gt;for people with diabetes in the UK. The problem: He had never been diagnosed with diabetes or shown any signs of the condition.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After opening the appointment letter late one evening, the patient, a healthy man in his mid-20’s, told &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; he had briefly worried that he had been unknowingly diagnosed with the condition, before concluding the letter must just be an admin error. The next day, at a pre-scheduled routine blood test, a nurse questioned the diagnosis and, when the patient confirmed he wasn’t diabetic, the pair reviewed his medical history.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He showed me the notes on the system, and they were AI-generated summaries. It was at that point I realized something weird was going on,” the patient, who asked for anonymity to discuss private health information, told &lt;em&gt;Fortune.&lt;/em&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After requesting and reviewing his medical records in full, the patient noticed the entry that had introduced the diabetes diagnosis was listed as a summary that had been “generated by Annie AI.” The record appeared around the same time he had attended the hospital for a severe case of tonsillitis. However, the record in question made no mention of tonsillitis. Instead, it said he had presented with chest pain and shortness of breath, attributed to a “likely angina due to coronary artery disease.” In reality, he had none of those symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="1"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The records, which were reviewed by &lt;em&gt;Fortune,&lt;/em&gt; also noted the patient had been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes late last year and was currently on a series of medications. It also included dosage and administration details for the drugs. However, none of these details were accurate, according to the patient and several other medical records reviewed by &lt;em&gt;Fortune.&lt;/em&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;‘Health Hospital’ in ‘Health City’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even stranger, the record attributed the address of the medical document it appeared to be processing to a fictitious “Health Hospital” located on “456 Care Road” in “Health City.” The address also included an invented postcode.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A representative for the NHS, Dr. Matthew Noble&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; told &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; the GP practice responsible for the oversight employs a “limited use of supervised AI” and the error was a “one-off case of human error.” He said that a medical summariser had initially spotted the mistake in the patient’s record but had been distracted and “inadvertently saved the original version rather than the updated version [they] had been working on.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the fictitious AI-generated record appears to have had downstream consequences, with the patient’s invitation to attend a diabetic eye screening appointment presumedly based on the erroneous summary. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most AI tools used in healthcare are monitored by strict human oversight, another NHS worker told &lt;em&gt;Fortune &lt;/em&gt;that the leap from the original symptoms—tonsillitis—to what was returned—likely angina due to coronary artery disease—raised alarm bells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="3"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These human error mistakes are fairly inevitable if you have an AI system producing completely inaccurate summaries,” the NHS employee said. “Many elderly or less literate patients may not even know there was an issue.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company behind the technology, Anima Health, did not respond to &lt;em&gt;Fortune’s &lt;/em&gt;questions about the issue. However, Dr. Noble said, “Anima is an NHS-approved document management system that assists practice staff in processing incoming documents and actioning any necessary tasks.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No documents are ever processed by AI, Anima only suggests codes and a summary to a human reviewer in order to improve safety and efficiency. Each and every document requires review by a human before being actioned and filed,” he added.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AI’s uneasy rollout in the health sector&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The incident is somewhat emblematic of the growing pains around AI’s rollout in healthcare. As hospitals and GP practices race to adopt automation tools that promise to ease workloads and reduce costs, they’re also grappling with the challenge of integrating still-maturing technology into high-stakes environments. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pressure to innovate and potentially save lives with the technology is high, but so is the need for rigorous oversight, especially as tools once seen as “assistive” begin influencing real patient care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="5"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company behind the tech, Anima Health, promises healthcare professionals can “save hours per day through automation.” The company offers services including automatically generating “the patient communications, clinical notes, admin requests, and paperwork that doctors deal with daily.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anima’s AI tool, Annie, is registered with the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) as a Class I medical device. This means it is regarded as low-risk and designed to assist clinicians, such as &lt;a href="https://innovation.nhs.uk/innovation-guides/regulation/general-medical-device-and-active-implantable-medical-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://innovation.nhs.uk/innovation-guides/regulation/general-medical-device-and-active-implantable-medical-devices/" class="sc-19cc8fd2-0 iHosVH"&gt;examination lights or bandages&lt;/a&gt;, rather than automate medical decisions. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI tools in this category require outputs to be reviewed by a clinician before action is taken or items are entered into the patient record. However, in this case of the misdiagnosed patient, the practice appeared to fail to appropriately address the factual errors before they were added to the patient’s records.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incident comes amid increased scrutiny within the UK’s health service of the use and categorization of AI technology. Last month, bosses for the health service warned GPs and hospitals that some current uses of AI software could breach data protection rules and put patients at risk.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an email first reported&lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/doctors-are-using-unapproved-ai-software-to-record-patient-meetings-investigation-reveals-13387765" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://news.sky.com/story/doctors-are-using-unapproved-ai-software-to-record-patient-meetings-investigation-reveals-13387765" class="sc-19cc8fd2-0 iHosVH"&gt; by Sky News&lt;/a&gt; and confirmed by &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;, NHS England warned that unapproved AI software that breached minimum standards could risk putting patients at harm. The letter specifically addressed the use of Ambient Voice Technology, or “AVT” by some doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="7"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main issue with AI transcribing or summarizing information is the manipulation of the original text, Brendan Delaney, professor of Medical Informatics and Decision Making at Imperial College London and a PT General Practitioner, told &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rather than just simply passively recording, it gives it a medical device purpose,” Delaney said. The recent guidance issued by the NHS, however, has meant that some companies and practices are playing regulatory catch-up. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most of the devices now that were in common use now have a Class One [categorization],” Delaney said. “I know at least one, but probably many others are now scrambling to try and start their Class 2a, because they ought to have that.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether a device should be defined as a Class 2a medical device essentially depends on its intended purpose and the level of clinical risk. Under U.K. medical device rules, if the tool’s output is relied upon to inform care decisions, it could require reclassification as a Class 2a medical device, a category subject to stricter regulatory controls.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anima Health, along with other UK-based health tech companies, is &lt;a href="https://www.animahealth.com/blog/anima-full-compliance-with-nhs-england-avt-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.animahealth.com/blog/anima-full-compliance-with-nhs-england-avt-requirements" class="sc-19cc8fd2-0 iHosVH"&gt;currently pursuing Class 2a registration.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="9"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The U.K.’s AI for health push&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The U.K. government is embracing the possibilities of AI in healthcare, hoping it can boost the country’s strained national health system.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/10-year-health-plan-for-england-fit-for-the-future" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/10-year-health-plan-for-england-fit-for-the-future" class="sc-19cc8fd2-0 iHosVH"&gt; “10-Year Health Plan,”&lt;/a&gt; the British government said it aims to make the NHS the most AI-enabled care system in the world, using the tech to reduce admin burden, support preventive care, and empower patients through technology.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But rolling out this technology in a way that meets current rules within the organization is complex. Even the U.K.’s health minister appeared to suggest earlier this year that some doctors may be pushing the limits when it comes to integrating AI technology in patient care.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve heard anecdotally down the pub, genuinely down the pub, that some clinicians are getting ahead of the game and are already using ambient AI to kind of record notes and things, even where their practice or their trust haven’t yet caught up with them,” Wes Streeting said, in comments reported by Sky News.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now, lots of issues there—not encouraging it—but it does tell me that contrary to this, ‘Oh, people don’t want to change, staff are very happy and they are really resistant to change’, it’s the opposite. People are crying out for this stuff,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="11"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI tech certainly has huge possibilities to dramatically improve speed, accuracy, and access to care, especially in areas like diagnostics, medical recordkeeping, and reaching patients in under-resourced or remote settings. However, walking the line between the tech’s potential and risks is difficult in sectors like healthcare that deal with sensitive data and could cause significant harm.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on his experience, the patient told &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;: “In general, I think we should be using AI tools to support the NHS. It has massive potential to save money and time. However, LLMs are still really experimental, so they should be used with stringent oversight. I would hate this to be used as an excuse to not pursue innovation but instead should be used to highlight where caution and oversight are needed.”

For instance, a probiotic or essential oil that contains substances found in farm dust, such as microbes and the molecules they produce, could stimulate children’s immune systems in a way that prevents allergic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2SFF6MNEFVFK7E5B6PZIQMIF7I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Certain kinds of farming practices, particularly the very traditional ones, have this extraordinary protective effect in the sense that, in these communities, asthma and allergies are virtually unknown,” said &lt;a href="https://cmm.arizona.edu/profile/donata-vercelli-md" target="_blank"&gt;Donata Vercelli&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of cellular and molecular medicine at the University of Arizona. “The studies that have been done in these farming populations are critical because they tell us that protection is an attainable goal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HRQOOVOMW5ARBB6RQOKNJT7OGI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Amish are members of a Christian group who practice traditional farming — many live on single-family dairy farms — and use horses for fieldwork and transportation. As of 2024, around &lt;a href="https://groups.etown.edu/amishstudies/population-2024/" target="_blank"&gt;395,000 Amish&lt;/a&gt; live in the United States, concentrated mostly in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2AJY73RCKVGXTNBVWD6TMEVACA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Over the past century, the incidence of allergic diseases — including hay fever (allergic rhinitis), asthma, food allergies and eczema — has increased dramatically. Hay fever, or an allergic reaction to tree, grass and weed pollens, emerged as the first recognized allergic disease in the early 1800s, climbing to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3293845/" target="_blank"&gt;epidemic levels&lt;/a&gt; in Europe and North America by 1900.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CWBGKCI4YRHEVL5BJPRQLMWCCQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The 1960s saw a sharp increase in the prevalence of pediatric &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4617537/#S3" target="_blank"&gt;asthma&lt;/a&gt;, a condition in which the airways tighten when breathing in an allergen. From the 1990s onward, there has been an upswing in the developed world in food allergies, including cow’s milk, peanut and egg allergies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RSLYT44TJFGGPBUJOWT6G2LPX4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Urbanization, air pollution, dietary changes and an indoor lifestyle are often cited as possible factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="44OAN52KXNBFTMJ7FFRYU52ABI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2222.2006.02463.x" target="_blank"&gt;“hygiene hypothesis”&lt;/a&gt; — first proposed in a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1838109/pdf/bmj00259-0027.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;1989 study by &lt;/a&gt;American immunologist David Strachan — suggests that early childhood exposure to microbes protects against allergic diseases by contributing to the development of a healthy immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SJ62WORKQ5BDTDVCRKM3H2GVBU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study found that hay fever and eczema were less common among children born into larger families.

Perhaps even more beneficial than having older siblings or pets, however, is growing up on a farm. (More than 150 years ago, hay fever was known as an &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/b20418620" target="_blank"&gt;“aristocratic disease,”&lt;/a&gt; almost wholly confined to the upper classes of society.

But even among farming communities, the most pronounced effect appears to be in the Amish. In a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1508749?casa_token=TfgpIBnROMwAAAAA:ZmgH1ubJ6RjZcu0VwWp1IqL08c3V4PYb6O4rFLFn7o2oF4GC2efqf9dnezOe7102EPp6Ls1UDm7lSdU" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of 60 schoolchildren by Ober, Vercelli and their colleagues, the prevalence of asthma was four times lower in the Amish as compared with the Hutterites, another U.S. farming community with a similar genetic ancestry and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CLO5AK3BZFBQ3NRIRUZ3TWH6OE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The prevalence of allergic sensitization — the development of antibodies to allergens and the first step to developing an allergy — was six times higher in the Hutterites. The researchers first ruled out a genetic cause; in fact, an analysis showed that the Amish and Hutterite children were remarkably similar in their ancestral roots. Instead, the main difference between these two populations seemed to be the amount of exposure as young children to farm animals or barns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AYMREDE3LBF3JEFOSTKAWYPLSY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The Hutterite kids and pregnant moms don’t go into the animal barns. Kids aren’t really exposed to the animal barns until they’re like 12 or so, when they start learning how to do the work on the farm,” Ober said. “The Amish kids are in and out of the cow barns all day long from an early age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LSCZQF7BTVF6DMCG25AFYT73BQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When analyzing samples of Amish and Hutterite house dust, they found a microbial load almost seven times higher in Amish homes. Later &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5495101/" target="_blank"&gt;experiments&lt;/a&gt; showed that the airways of mice that inhaled Amish dust had dramatically reduced asthmalike symptoms when exposed to allergens. Mice that inhaled Hutterite dust did not receive the same benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ULV25BYEDZCTZLHJ5AANYVK4VU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Now, Ober and Vercelli are beginning to identify the protective agents in Amish dust that prevent allergic asthma. In 2023, their &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674923007066" target="_blank"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of farm dust found proteins that act like delivery trucks, loaded with molecules produced by microbes and plants. When these transport proteins deliver their cargo to the mucus that lines the respiratory tract, it creates a protective environment that regulates airway responses and prevents inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IZ757QVFS5ERPIHT5AM7ANSHCM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We don’t really talk about the hygiene hypothesis as much anymore because we now understand that it’s not really about how hygienic you’re living,” said &lt;a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/people/112360153-kirsi-m-jarvinen-seppo" target="_blank"&gt;Kirsi Järvinen-Seppo&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Center for Food Allergy at the University of Rochester Medical Center. “It’s more like a microbial hypothesis, since beneficial bacteria that colonize the gut and other mucosal surfaces play a significant role.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="65DZXHH6PJBSBHZIG6HNTODXBE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;During the first year or two of life, a baby’s immune system is rapidly developing and highly malleable by environmental stimuli, such as bacteria. Some experts believe that exposing young children to certain types of beneficial bacteria can engage and shape the growing immune system in a way that reduces the risk of allergic diseases later in life. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11877632/#imr70012-sec-0015" target="_blank"&gt;Farm dust&lt;/a&gt; contains a hodgepodge of bacteria shed from livestock and animal feed that isn’t harmful enough to cause illness, but does effectively train the immune system to become less responsive to allergens later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4DGEPS5T2BHWFM776J64JRMHBI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In 2021, Järvinen-Seppo and her colleagues compared the &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/all.14877?casa_token=ZKhKPcIO6EkAAAAA%3AFSy-TdwFIEjoHyTakQIWeE4hY6n9-xV0T6FwV6RJsSJvykykDmP1msQq-SviEXKQVCC91bzkWRhIqtM_" target="_blank"&gt;gut microbiomes&lt;/a&gt; of 65 Old Order Mennonite infants from a rural community in New York with 39 urban/suburban infants from nearby Rochester. Like the Amish, the Old Order Mennonites follow a traditional agrarian lifestyle. Almost three-fourths of Mennonite infants in the study were colonized with &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;infantis&lt;/i&gt;, a bacterium associated with lower rates of allergic diseases, in contrast to 21 percent of Rochester infants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SEBT7UXCKRC7ZKJG43NQQ7F4ZY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The colonization rate is very low in the United States and other Western countries, compared to very high rates in Mennonite communities, similar to some developing countries,” Järvinen-Seppo said. “This mirrors the rates of autoimmune and allergic diseases.” These clues about the origin of the farm effect represent a step toward the prevention of allergic diseases, Järvinen-Seppo says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PCYTASANOND3PCLQ6UZ4ZGQX3I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Whatever form the treatment takes, the impact on prevention of allergic diseases, which affect millions of people worldwide and reduce quality of life, could be enormous, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3BE2HSKAQJDSJKV3ESBJQYEQXI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I don’t know that we can give every family a cow. … But we are learning from these time-honored and very stable environments what type of substances and exposures are needed,” Vercelli said. “Once we know that, I don’t think there will be any impediment to creating protective strategies along these lines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 13:31:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNTVlacUprWlVoZ05VMWVSV09lcEhoSU1wNmVKNjAxX1lSYVYzNlNWT2c5YWpNU0h3dXNZeHBGbUplSFlkNDdVTGZoUW9JdEo3T0RfSXM2RUplVlVLN25XUzVyNkNZUkV4WFlibFFtdU5RTGFqSDI1MjNtaVZxdmVlTE9ZVlFScUE</guid></item><item><title>我在39岁时参加了第四次马拉松训练......然后被诊断出患有致命的癌症，在年轻人中爆发-每日邮报 | I was training for my fourth marathon at 39... then diagnosed with a deadly cancer exploding among young people - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lindsay Barad felt like she was in the best shape of her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 39-year-old New Yorker had just run her fourth 26.2-mile marathon, and was avoiding &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-993a9400-6289-11f0-9784-357eae7e5d39" class=""&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; and even eating clean.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors had dismissed them too, saying they were 'just something women go through' and putting her on birth control and over-the-counter painkillers to reduce her symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in late 2021, after she changed gynecologist, Barad was recommended for an ultrasound on the pretence of getting an IUD, or small T-shaped device that is inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scan revealed a grapefruit-sized cyst on her right ovary, despite the fact that ovaries are only about three to five centimeters long. This was also very large for Barad, who is just 5ft 1in tall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was rushed into surgery, but during the procedure doctors noted a strange mucus in her abdominal cavity and that her appendix was swollen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They removed her appendix and sent it for testing, along with her cyst, right ovary and right fallopian tube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A few weeks later, in December 2021, she was called back into her doctor's office to be given the diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Barad said: 'It's hard to figure out when was that quote-unquote normal [menstrual cramps] versus when did I have appendix cancer, and that was what was making the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What was a red flag symptom was close to my diagnosis I had to urinate a lot, and I would notice every time I would drink something I would have to use the bathroom. I always felt the need to pee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Barad was an avid runner before the diagnosis, and was training for her fourth marathon when she was told she had appendiceal cancer. It came as a total shock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And it turned out that was because I had a huge ovarian cyst and it was taking up space where my bladder is and that was me needing to urinate.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Appendiceal cancer has no clear symptoms, especially in its early stages, meaning doctors often struggle to diagnose the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is rare, with about 3,000 cases every year, and normally diagnosed in people around 50 and 55 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But as cases have risen among younger adults, researchers have suggested that shifts in the microbiome caused by the western diet could be raising the risk of developing the cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is also one of the leading theories linked to a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13271881/colon-cancer-mystery-causing-rise-young-people.html"&gt;surge in colon cancer &lt;/a&gt;in young people.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are several types of the cancer, but Barad was diagnosed with&lt;span&gt; low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (LAMN), a rare and slow-growing form where cells in the appendix overproduce mucin — a jelly-like substance — that can flood the abdominal cavity and push other cells into it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This disruption in the body's internal cavity can cause a large cyst to develop on an ovary, like in Barad's case, or on another organ of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It isn't clear how often this form of the disease affects patients, but some studies on only a small number of patients have suggested it is around 40 percent of all cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To treat her cancer, Barad was brought in for a major 12-hour surgery in March 2022 to try to clear the disease from her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the procedure, surgeons initially made an incision from her chest to her pelvis and opened up her body, before trying to remove as much of mucin as possible that was coating each organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Barad is pictured above following surgery to remove the cancer from the inside of her body. She was told she had hundreds of tiny tumors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They removed part of her liver, omentum - the thin tissue surrounding the stomach - and part of her diaphragm during the surgery because these were covered in mucin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors also said they might have to remove her uterus, leaving Barad unable to start a family, but managed to save the organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, doctors pumped her abdominal cavity full of chemotherapy drugs heated to 106F (41C), sewed her up and rotated her for about 90 minutes. She was rotated to spread the chemotherapy drugs in her abdomen to treat any remaining cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drugs were then extracted, and Barad said she went through months of a 'miserable' recovery where she was so unwell she was barely able to leave the apartment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the surgery was a success, and the cancer has not been detected in Barad since. She now returns every year to the hospital to check for recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Appendix cancer is slow-growing, however, with Barad saying that she will never be considered 'cured,' just 'in remission' because of the risk more cancerous cells could appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'It's so slow moving, it could be slowly growing over the next couple of years, so it's uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But every year now I get scans and blood work done and I feel like I am just in really good hands with all of this.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Barad, who is from New York City, is now living an intentional life, and is thankful for those around her and enjoying going on long hikes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She was treated for the cancer in a grueling 12-hour surgery, but said she has not needed any further surgery or chemotherapy since&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Survival rates for appendix cancer vary widely depending on the type and how advanced the cancer is,&lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cancercenter.com/cancer-types/appendix-cancer/stages"&gt; with between&lt;/a&gt; 67 and 97 percent of patients living for longer than five years after their diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For LAMN, about 64 percent of patients survive for longer than five years according &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6524118/"&gt;to studies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amid her recovery, Barad said she is now trying to live an intentional life and is thankful for the people around her and aiming to raise awareness about the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She lives in her apartment with her dog Charlie, a rescued Maltese poodle mix, and keeps active with long hikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also had her eggs frozen at age 35 in case she wanted to start a family but now says she doesn't think she wants to put her body through the trial of pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Barad is thankful that her cancer was slow growing but fears the outcome if it had not been detected earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was helped through her journey by &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmppals.net/"&gt;PMP Pals&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.abdominalcancers.org/"&gt;Abdominal Cancers Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, which aim to help patients with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The research tracked over a thousand women across the United States and found that exposure to concentrated neighborhood poverty was linked to sharper drops in episodic memory over time. The decline was most pronounced among Black women. The findings were published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70139" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While earlier research has shown that people in lower-income neighborhoods face higher risks for various health conditions, including memory decline and dementia, most studies have examined each person’s immediate residential area in isolation. They often did not consider how poor neighborhoods might be clustered together or how neighborhood conditions change over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research has shown that people living in low-income neighborhoods are more likely to develop various physical and mental illnesses and tend to have shorter lifespans than people living in higher-income areas. However, people’s neighborhood exposures are not restricted to the immediate areas around their homes, as they tend to actively seek resources, such as food, from nearby neighborhoods to meet their daily needs,” said study author &lt;a href="https://einsteinmed.edu/faculty/15867/jinshil-hyun" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Jinshil Hyun&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor in the Saul R. Korey Department of Neurology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hypothesized that individuals living in low-income neighborhoods might successfully access better resources elsewhere, unless their communities are surrounded entirely by other low-income neighborhoods. In such cases, their access would be severely restricted, potentially harming their health-related behaviors and health outcomes. We chose to investigate whether living in areas of more concentrated poverty affects cognitive health among midlife women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their new study, the researchers considered both the person’s neighborhood and the surrounding areas to measure concentrated poverty. They also accounted for changes in address over time, allowing them to assess long-term exposure to neighborhood disadvantage. Rather than relying on general cognitive tests, the researchers focused on specific cognitive skills that often decline with age: processing speed, working memory, and episodic memory. The goal was to understand whether living in high-poverty “hot spots” during midlife would predict declines in these areas—and whether the effects differed across racial and ethnic groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The &lt;a href="https://www.swanstudy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN)&lt;/a&gt; provided the opportunity to examine this question using data collected over (up to 14 years of data) in women at over midlife women from 5 sites in the United States,” Hyun explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study followed 1,391 women from Ann Arbor, Boston, Chicago, Alameda and Contra Costa County, Los Angeles, Jersey City, and Pittsburgh. Participants ranged in age from 49 to 60 at the study’s cognitive starting point. The researchers followed them for up to 13.5 years and conducted repeated assessments of their memory and thinking abilities. They also gathered information on a range of factors known to influence brain health, including education, menopause status, financial hardship, physical activity, smoking, alcohol use, and cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure neighborhood poverty, the researchers used U.S. Census data to calculate poverty rates in each participant’s home census tract and the surrounding tracts. They categorized neighborhoods into three levels: low, moderate, and high concentrated poverty. High-concentration areas were defined as those with unusually high poverty rates that were geographically clustered. These designations took into account how often participants moved and how their neighborhood conditions changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main finding was that women living in high concentrated poverty areas experienced a faster decline in episodic memory, which includes both immediate and delayed recall of information. Episodic memory is the ability to remember specific events or pieces of information from one’s own experience. Unlike processing speed, which naturally tends to decline in midlife, episodic memory often remains more stable. A sharper-than-expected decline in this type of memory during midlife can be an early warning sign of cognitive problems later in life, including dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women living in high-poverty neighborhoods saw a 7% decline in immediate and delayed episodic memory over a 10-year span. The decline in delayed recall was even steeper—about 10%—for Black women living in those same neighborhoods. In contrast, women living in lower poverty areas either did not experience this level of decline or saw only mild reductions. This pattern remained consistent even when accounting for differences in education, smoking, alcohol use, menopause status, and physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processing speed and working memory were also affected by neighborhood poverty but in different ways. Women in poorer neighborhoods had lower average scores on these tests at the start of the study. However, the rate at which these abilities declined over time did not differ significantly across neighborhood types. This suggests that neighborhood poverty may shape baseline brain health but does not necessarily speed up age-related decline in all cognitive areas equally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Experiencing cognitive decline is a natural part of aging, and different aspects of cognition decline at different rates,” Hyun told PsyPost. “For example, processing speed typically starts to slow down in early adulthood, while memory usually remains stable until later in life. However, our study revealed that women living in areas of concentrated poverty experienced accelerated memory decline even during midlife (approximately 7% per decade). Those living in higher income areas did not show significant memory decline. This suggests that living in highly concentrated low-income neighborhoods may be related to increased rates of cognitive aging, potentially increasing the risk of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test whether other factors could explain the link between neighborhood poverty and memory decline, the researchers considered cardiovascular health risks and physical activity levels. Both are known to influence cognitive function. However, these factors did not fully explain the memory differences observed in this study. This indicates that other pathways—possibly involving chronic stress, environmental toxins, or reduced access to stimulating environments—may be contributing to the decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was not surprised that living in high-poverty neighborhoods was associated with faster cognitive decline, but the magnitude of this effect was unexpectedly large,” Hyun said. “While residents of affluent neighborhoods showed no significant memory decline, residents of areas with concentrated poverty experienced a 7% decline per decade. Greater memory decline in midlife could serve as an early indicator of future Alzheimer’s risk. Alzheimer’s disease currently has no cure, and effective treatment options are limited. Therefore, addressing neighborhood and individual risk factors of Alzheimer’s disease as early as in midlife would be crucial.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at whether the effects of neighborhood poverty varied by race and ethnicity. They found that Black women living in high-poverty areas experienced the most rapid decline in delayed episodic memory. This may reflect the compounding effects of systemic disadvantage, such as racial discrimination and economic segregation, which can create chronic stress and limit access to health-promoting resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all research, the study has some limitations. For instance, the sample was drawn from urban areas, and the results may not apply to women living in rural settings. The study also did not account for neighborhood conditions earlier in life, which may have lasting effects on brain health. In addition, the study focused on where participants lived, not where they worked or spent their daily routines. These places may also influence cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, while the study found links between living in areas of concentrated poverty and memory decline, it could not confirm exactly how this relationship works. Future research is needed to identify which neighborhood features—such as access to parks, quality of schools, exposure to air pollution, or social cohesion—might influence cognitive aging. Real-time location tracking and environmental data could help researchers understand how different places shape health over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our next step is to better understand how people move through and use their surrounding areas in daily life,” Hyun said. “In a different study, the Einstein Aging Study, we are collecting GPS data from individuals to see whether their ability to travel to different neighborhoods is limited by where they live. By identifying these patterns, we can suggest targeted solutions that address both community-level factors (like improving neighborhood conditions) and personal-level strategies to support healthier lifestyles. Ultimately, our goal is to reduce the risk of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was funded by the National Institute on Aging, the Alzheimer’s Association, the Sylvia and Leonard Marx Foundation, and the Czap Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70139" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Exposure to neighborhood concentrated poverty is associated with faster decline in episodic memory among midlife women&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Jinshil Hyun, Mary Schiff, Charles B.

It wasn't until 2021 when she was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS, a hormonal disorder common among women of reproductive age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After she saw limited improvements from birth control, diet and exercise, Hamilton joined a trial in 2024 examining a GLP-1 drug in PCOS patients. By October, she received her first weekly dose of semaglutide, the active ingredient in &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-1"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/NVO/"&gt;Novo Nordisk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'s obesity injection Wegovy and diabetes shot Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said some results were almost immediate: after months without a cycle, her period resumed within two weeks of starting the drug. After 10 months on the treatment, Hamilton lost 50 pounds, saw hair regrowth and reported significant improvements in depression and anxiety&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm so glad that I stuck with it because it was just clear as day that it was the missing link for me," said Hamilton, who works at a nonprofit in Arvada, Colorado, adding that she maintained diet and exercise while on the drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is just one of several women who have reported improvements in symptoms of PCOS after using GLP-1s, a growing class of obesity and diabetes treatments that have drawn massive patient demand and investor buzz over the last few years. Treating PCOS is among several new but unapproved potential uses of the blockbuster drugs beyond promoting weight loss and regulating blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108174095" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"&gt;Grace Hamilton, a patient with PCOS talking GLP-1s in Galway, Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Courtesy: Addison Peacock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;PCOS, which is frequently underdiagnosed, affects an estimated 5 million to 6 million women of reproductive age in the U.S., according to &lt;a href="https://www.endocrine.org/patient-engagement/endocrine-library/pcos" target="_blank"&gt;some estimates&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition is typically characterized by higher levels of testosterone and other hormones usually associated with men called androgens, which can leads to symptoms such as irregular and painful periods, excess hair growth and acne. PCOS is the most common cause of infertility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition is strongly linked to metabolic issues, as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8984569/" target="_blank"&gt;an estimated 35% to 80% of patients &lt;/a&gt;experience insulin resistance. That means the pancreas pumps out more insulin to keep blood sugar in check, and high insulin levels can promote weight gain and disrupt hormone balance. A significant share of women with PCOS have obesity or Type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet there's no standard PCOS treatment. Current options like birth control, lifestyle changes and the diabetes drug Metformin may only help with certain symptoms, which could differ depending on the patient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some health experts see promise in GLP-1s, particularly given their effect on improving weight loss and insulin sensitivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The unmet need is massive," said Dr. Melanie Cree, a pediatric endocrinologist at Children's Hospital Colorado. "Primary therapies used for PCOS symptoms haven't changed in nearly 50 years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cree has been studying the effect of GLP-1s in adolescents with PCOS for more than 10 years. She previously studied the oral form of semaglutide and has an ongoing clinical trial on the injectable version, which is what Hamilton participated in for 10 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But her studies are still small in comparison to drugmakers' previous clinical trials on GLP-1s with thousands of patients. Not all of the women who have so far completed Cree's ongoing study lost significant weight, demonstrating that not everyone may respond to GLP-1s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk and rival &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-4"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/LLY/"&gt;Eli Lilly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have been studying their GLP-1s as potential treatments for other chronic conditions like fatty liver disease, but not PCOS. Cree said that's because the Food and Drug Administration has not established specific "endpoints" or goals drugs must meet in clinical trials to demonstrate how effective they are for PCOS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said the company welcomes "independent research investigating the safety, efficacy and clinical utility of our products, including semaglutide." Eli Lilly did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducting longer and larger trials to better understand the effect of GLP-1s on PCOS symptoms is crucial, said Sasha Ottey, executive director of the advocacy group PCOS Challenge. It is still unclear if GLP-1s can help address or resolve all PCOS symptoms, or whether the effect differs depending on a patient's age or the specific drug, Ottey said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that certain patients may not lose weight on GLP-1s, and others may not need to shed pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, insurance coverage for GLP-1s is a barrier for some PCOS patients, who are often eligible for approved uses of the drugs. Most plans cover GLP-1s for diabetes, but not for obesity or unapproved uses. The drugs can cost roughly $1,000 per month before insurance. Still, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk offer significant discounts on their drugs to some patients who pay for it out-of-pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Why GLP-1s may address PCOS symptoms &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to fully understand why GLP-1s may help some PCOS patients, but Cree said their effect on symptoms appears to be largely indirect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said a key finding in several previous studies motivated her to start studying GLP-1s: In adults with PCOS, losing as little as 5% of body weight can improve insulin sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That makes the body respond better to insulin, so it doesn't need to produce as much of it to manage blood sugar. That lowers insulin levels, which Cree and some researchers believe causes the ovaries to produce less testosterone and, as a result, can help reduce symptoms such as irregular periods, acne and excess hair growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the questions was, what other methods do we have to improve insulin sensitivity?" Cree said. She noted that other recommended treatments for PCOS symptoms, such as food changes, increasing exercise and the diabetes drug Metformin, are based on that goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1s such as semaglutide improve insulin sensitivity and reduce appetite through several mechanisms. That includes slowing how quickly food leaves the stomach, prompting the pancreas to release insulin when blood sugar is high and suppressing the release of a hormone that raises blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weight loss caused by GLP-1s further helps improve insulin sensitivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-107393750" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Daniel Grill | Tetra Images | Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early results from Cree's ongoing study support the idea that GLP-1s may lower testosterone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05819853" target="_blank"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;, which began in 2023, follows girls and women ages 12 to 35 with obesity and PCOS who are on or off Metformin. The study is designed to administer semaglutide to patients for 10 months, and examine their weight loss, metabolic changes and improvements in reproductive function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cree hopes the trial will answer whether GLP-1s can improve ovulation in women with PCOS. Many women with PCOS don't ovulate regularly, which can lead to irregular periods and difficulty getting pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cree has initial data on 11 women who completed the 10 months on semaglutide and were not on Metformin. She said eight of them lost more than 10% of their body weight and saw a reduction in their testosterone levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five out of the eight patients had their testosterone levels reach "normal ranges," Cree said. Meanwhile, six out of the eight patients reported more regular periods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cree said her trial will eventually have data from 40 women, but she is still enrolling patients in the group that takes Metformin. She said it will likely take two years before she publishes the first results from the study, which will focus on the differences in outcomes between kids and adults who only received semaglutide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said comparing the groups is crucial because hormones that control growth are released during puberty, which could change how kids respond to GLP-1s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all women with PCOS will benefit from taking a GLP-1. Cree said in her trial, three patients who completed 10 months on semaglutide did not lose at least 10% of their body weight. One of those women did not lose weight at all, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cree said that's consistent with previous studies on GLP-1s in adults with obesity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the promise of GLP-1s in improving symptoms, more research is also needed on PCOS itself, said Dr. Karen Tang, an OB-GYN and founder of Thrive Gynecology. She said some people can experience hallmark symptoms of the condition, such as facial hair and acne, even though they have normal levels of testosterone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's still a lot that's very much unknown about PCOS and exactly how the disease kind of works," Tang told CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;GLP-1s give some patients a big boost&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anecdotal evidence suggests GLP-1s may address more than just weight issues for people with PCOS. In &lt;a href="https://www.naturalcycles.com/research-library/do-glp-1-weight-loss-drugs-affect-the-menstrual-cycle" target="_blank"&gt;a recent survey&lt;/a&gt; of 1,700 people by the birth control app Natural Cycles, 64% of women with PCOS who took a GLP-1 reported more predictable periods, and 20% said their bleeding days were shorter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some patients with PCOS may also lose more weight on GLP-1s than those without the condition, said Dr. Kerry Krauss, an OB/GYN and medical director at Natural Cycles, who has PCOS herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research needs to confirm those benefits, but she said it gives hope to many PCOS patients who are frustrated with common treatments for the condition. Those options typically target just one aspect of PCOS, such as reducing androgen levels with certain types of birth control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tang added that diet and exercise alone often fall short of addressing symptoms: "A lot of people can exercise very aggressively and regularly or watch what they eat and still struggle with hormone imbalances, weight, and blood sugar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108174132" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"&gt;Haley Sipes a patient with PCOS taking GLP-1s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Courtesy: Haley Sipes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was the case for Haley Sipes, a 31-year-old mother of three based in Western Kentucky who experienced PCOS symptoms for years without a diagnosis. In 2022, before being diagnosed, she lost 75 pounds over 10 months through diet and exercise alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her progress stalled in late 2022 despite an intense diet and exercise regimen, and her weight began to fluctuate in 2023. By mid-2024, she had regained about 30 pounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sipes sought help from her primary care provider and underwent blood work, which revealed she had a hormonal imbalance. Initial efforts to regulate her hormones with progesterone and testosterone had a limited effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further bloodwork diagnosed Sipes with PCOS and insulin resistance, which she views as the root cause of her weight loss struggles. She recalled bloating, fatigue, low energy, and water retention during earlier efforts to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite her history of painful, irregular periods and ovarian cysts since age 10, her providers never mentioned PCOS as a possible diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 2024, her doctor prescribed Zepbound. Her insurance covered it due to her BMI and prediabetes status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sipes said she noticed changes within the first month: her food cravings quieted, her inflammation decreased, she experienced less joint pain, and her period became less painful and occurred more regularly. Sipes added that she has not had ovarian cysts since starting Zepbound. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After around eight months on the medication, she lost more than 60 pounds. Sipes said those results significantly improved her emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All the symptoms and being overweight might not seem like big things, but when you have 20 little things that are constantly nagging you, then you're going to be in a bad mood sometimes," Sipes said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm just a better version of myself when I'm not controlled by food thoughts and hormonal issues that cause mood swings," she continued. "My life does feel so much more enjoyable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sipes plans to continue taking Zepbound to maintain her results, possibly at lower doses. She noted that more research is needed on whether PCOS symptoms can fully resolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Insurance coverage is a challenge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insurance coverage is currently the biggest hurdle preventing PCOS patients from accessing GLP-1s, said Dr. Alyssa Dominguez, an endocrinologist with Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California. She said many PCOS patients are eligible to use GLP-1s for their approved uses based on BMI or related conditions, but may not have coverage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than one-third of employers now cover GLP-1s for both weight loss and diabetes, while 55% only cover them for diabetes, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.ifebp.org/resources---news/survey-reports/glp-1-drugs-us--2025-pulse-survey" target="_blank"&gt;recent survey&lt;/a&gt; from the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, President Donald Trump rejected a Biden administration plan that would have required Medicare and Medicaid to cover obesity drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108174099" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"&gt;Nabeelah Karim is a patient with PCOS who took GLP-1s to manage her symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Courtesy: Nabeelah Karim&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some patients, like 34-year-old California mom Nabeelah Karim, have turned to other options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karim was diagnosed with PCOS at 19 and took birth control on and off until giving birth in 2021. She said she struggled with hair loss, irregular periods, debilitating cramps, facial hair growth, severe water retention and mood swings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karim said her period symptoms worsened after she gave birth, and in late 2023, she began what would be a painful five-month-long period. Doctors suggested that she lose weight, take painkillers or return to birth control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Karim lost some weight through diet and exercise, she was eventually prescribed Eli Lilly's diabetes drug Mounjaro through the digital health startup Noom in April 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her long period stopped and symptoms eased within days, and she began to lose more weight over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It had solved all the problems that I had experienced for years up until that point," Karim said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But her insurance plan never formally approved or denied coverage of Mounjaro, forcing her to pay its more than $1,000 per month out-of-pocket price. She eventually found a third-party compounding pharmacy that accepted her prescription, allowing her to buy a cheaper but unapproved version of the drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karim used that compounded version for six months and continued to experience weight loss and improvements to her PCOS symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During FDA&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/drug-shortages" target="_blank"&gt;-declared shortages&lt;/a&gt;, pharmacists can legally make compounded versions of brand-name medications. They can also be produced on a case-by-case basis when it's medically necessary for a patient, such as when they can't swallow a pill or are allergic to a specific ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and some health experts have pushed back – and in some cases, taken legal action – against the practice, largely because the FDA does not approve compounded drugs. The FDA has declared U.S. shortages of both companies' drugs over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When people ask about how safe compounded drugs are, the answer I typically give is I don't know," said Dominguez from USC's School of Medicine.

Turns out, with artificial sweeteners, you can. But what if that very solution becomes a rather bigger problem in the long run?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial sweeteners promised sweetness without the guilt. However, new research is now raising serious questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study from the University of Colorado Boulder has raised concerns about erythritol, a common sugar substitute often marketed to people with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Used in popular brands like Wholesome, Truvia, and Splenda, erythritol was once thought to be one of the best sweeteners due to its sweetness without significant effects on insulin or blood sugar levels. However, new findings suggest it may pose more risks than benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to know more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the study say?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, researchers from the University of Colorado Boulder found that erythritol can harm brain cells and increase the risk of stroke and heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following earlier findings that showed a connection between higher levels of erythritol in the bloodstream and increased risks of stroke and heart attack, Professor Christopher DeSouza and graduate student Auburn Berry aimed to dive deeper into this concerning trend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their lab experiments, they treated brain blood vessel cells with the amount of erythritol found in a typical sugar-free drink. They discovered that these cells displayed lower levels of nitric oxide, a molecule that helps relax and widen blood vessels. At the same time, they had higher levels of endothelin-1, a protein that constricts blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the key findings?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lab-based research revealed that the sweetened cells produced lots of "free radicals," which can cause inflammation and aging in cells, and showed a significantly muted response to a compound called thrombin, which assists in clot formation. In simple terms, the cells were not functioning as they should have. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berry explained in a press release., “Big picture, if your vessels are more constricted and your ability to break down blood clots is lowered, your risk of stroke goes up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These worrying effects were seen even with the erythritol from just one sugar-free drink. As DeSouza cautioned, for those consuming multiple drinks daily, the consequences could be even more severe, advising, "Given the epidemiological study that inspired our work, and now our cellular findings, we believe it would be prudent for people to monitor their consumption of non-nutrient-sweeteners such as this one."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeSouza also suggested checking food labels for erythritol, also known as "sugar alcohol." This is especially important since people with diabetes already face double the risk of stroke compared to those without diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is erythritol?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol is an organic compound, the naturally occurring achiral meso four-carbon sugar alcohol. It is the reduced form of either D- or L-erythrose and one of the two reduced forms of erythrulose. It is used as a food additive and sugar substitute. It is synthesized from corn using enzymes and fermentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Created during the corn fermentation process, erythritol, an organic compound used for so-called "stevia" products sold by the brands Wholesome, Truvia, and Splenda, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration back in 2001. Since then, erythritol has been considered one of the best sweeteners on the market because of its near-sugar-level sweetness that barely affects insulin or blood sugar in diabetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the alternatives?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As erythritol is proving to be a ‘sweet poison’, it’s better to opt for natural sweeteners as alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Raw honey:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Raw, unprocessed honey is packed with antioxidants, enzymes, and trace vitamins (B6, C), along with minerals such as zinc, iron, and potassium—much more nutritious than regular sugar. Mix into yogurt, herbal tea, homemade granola, or drizzle over pancakes. Use about ¾ cup of honey for every cup of sugar, but reduce the surrounding liquids and include a pinch of baking soda to balance the acidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pure maple syrup:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rich in antioxidants and essential minerals like manganese, zinc, and calcium, providing recipes with an appealing earthy sweetness. Replace ¾ cup of sugar with syrup, reducing about 3–4 tablespoons of liquid. Pour over oatmeal, toast, smoothies, or incorporate into marinades and dressings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Date syrup or date sugar:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Made from whole dates, this sweetener is high in potassium, magnesium, and antioxidants, plus fiber that slows the absorption of sugar. Add date syrup to smoothies or use as a natural syrup, or utilize date sugar in baking. Note that it may not dissolve completely, but it provides texture and caramel flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Coconut Sugar:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has caramel undertones and is less refined than white sugar. It contains small amounts of iron, zinc, potassium, calcium, and inulin fiber. Substitute cup-for-cup in recipes; ideal for cookies, cakes, and coffee, bringing that warm sweetness. Moderation is still key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Blackstrap molasses / Jaggery:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blackstrap molasses offers iron, calcium, magnesium, and B vitamins; jaggery provides iron, potassium, magnesium, and a rich caramel flavor. Bold and intense, molasses offers a robust flavor profile; jaggery delivers earthy caramel. Combine with gingerbread, BBQ marinades, chai, or break into porridges, using it sparingly as a flavor enhancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Monk fruit (Luo Han Guo):&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Monk fruit from Southeast Asia produces mogrosides, natural antioxidants yielding 150–300 times the sweetness without calories, and is generally recognized as safe (GRAS). Sprinkle in teas, salad dressings, and baked goods. Since it lacks bulk, pair with bulking agents if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Yacon syrup and allulose:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yacon syrup is a prebiotic substance from the Andes that is high in inulin and FOS; it has half the calories and a caramel flavor while supporting gut health. Allulose is a unique sugar that mimics the taste and texture of sugar, has negligible calories, does not cause an insulin spike, and may help with weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: The information provided in this story is based on emerging scientific studies suggesting a potential link between artificial sweeteners and health hazards.
