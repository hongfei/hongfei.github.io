                                        &lt;p&gt;Our immune system has a dark side: It’s supposed to fight off invaders to keep us healthy. But sometimes &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/autoimmune-disease-lupus-diagnosis-symptoms-b1f2ba32883c63fff1af689a45281305"&gt;it turns traitor and attacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; our own cells and tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are called autoimmune diseases can affect just about every part of the body – and tens of millions of people. While &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/autoimmune-lupus-women-rheumatoid-arthritis-aff0e28dece3ef4168f301bd84331ea5"&gt;most common in women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, these diseases can strike anyone, adults or children, and they’re on the rise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research is raising the prospect of treatments that might do more than tamp down symptoms. Dozens of clinical trials are testing ways to reprogram an immune system-gone-rogue, with some promising early successes &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/photo-essay/autoimmune-disease-lupus-diagnosis-symptoms-c4d3ba32ccd0e0be779e712f4d8bf4d9"&gt;against lupus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, myositis and certain other illnesses. Other researchers are hunting ways to at least delay brewing autoimmune diseases, spurred by a drug that can buy some time before people show symptoms of Type 1 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is probably the most exciting time that we’ve ever had to be in autoimmunity,” said Dr. Amit Saxena, a rheumatologist at NYU Langone Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some things to know.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;What are autoimmune diseases?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re chronic diseases that can range from mild to life-threatening, more than 100 with different names depending on how and where they do damage. Rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis attack joints. Sjögren’s disease is known for dry eyes and mouth. Myositis and myasthenia gravis weaken muscles in different ways, the latter by attacking how nerves signal them. Lupus has widely varied symptoms including a butterfly-shaped facial rash, joint and muscle pain, fevers and damage to the kidneys, lungs and heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re also capricious: Even patients faring well for long periods can suddenly have a “flare” for no apparent reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;h2&gt;Why autoimmune diseases are so difficult to diagnose&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many start with vague symptoms that come and go or mimic other illnesses. Many also have overlapping symptoms – rheumatoid arthritis and Sjögren’s also can harm major organs, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis can take multiple tests, including some blood tests to detect antibodies that mistakenly latch onto healthy tissue. It usually centers on symptoms and involves ruling out other causes. Depending on the disease it can take years and seeing multiple doctors before one puts the clues together. There are efforts to improve: The National MS Society is educating doctors about newly updated guidelines to streamline diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;How the immune system gets out of whack&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human immune system is a complex army with sentinels to detect threats like germs or cancer cells, a variety of soldiers to attack them, and peacemakers to calm things down once the danger is over. Key is that it can distinguish what’s foreign from what’s “you,” what scientists call tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes confused immune cells or antibodies slip through, or the peacemakers can’t calm things down after a battle. If the system can’t spot and fix the problem, autoimmune diseases gradually develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Autoimmune diseases are often set off by a trigger&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most autoimmune diseases, especially in adults, aren’t caused by a specific gene defect. Instead, a variety of genes that affect immune functions can make people susceptible. Scientists say it then takes some “environmental” trigger, such as an infection, smoking or pollutants, to set the disease into motion. For example, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/multiple-sclerosis-epstein-barr-study-b325dceb5612e4ec7f22c8f25901e5eb"&gt;the Epstein-Barr virus is linked to MS.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are zeroing in on the earliest molecular triggers. For example, white blood cells called neutrophils are first responders to signs of infection or injury — but abnormally overactive ones are suspected of playing a key role in lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Women are at highest risk for autoimmune diseases &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women account for about 4 of 5 autoimmune patients, many of them young. Hormones are thought to play a role. But also, females have two X chromosomes while males have one X and one Y. Some research suggests an abnormality in how female cells switch off that extra X can increase women’s vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But men do suffer from autoimmune diseases. One especially severe one named VEXAS syndrome wasn’t discovered until 2020. It mainly affects men over 50 and in addition to typical autoimmune symptoms it can cause blood clots, shortness of breath and night sweats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain populations also have higher risks. For example, lupus is more common in Black and Hispanic women. Northern Europeans have a higher risk of MS than other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Treatment for autoimmune diseases is complicated&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to investment research company Morningstar, the global market for autoimmune disease treatments is $100 billion a year. That’s not counting doctor visits and such things as lost time at work. Treatment is lifelong and, while usually covered by insurance, can be pricey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not so long ago there was little to offer for many autoimmune diseases beyond high-dose steroids and broad immune-suppressing drugs, with side effects that include a risk of infections and cancer. Today some newer options target specific molecules, somewhat less immune dampening. But for many autoimmune diseases, treatment is trial and error, with little to guide patient decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A Florida doctor named Lily J. Voepel is in hot water after some of her patients contracted the dangerous bloodborne infection hepatitis C while under her care. A recent investigation by the Florida Department of Health uncovered numerous unsafe practices at Voepel’s office that may have contributed to these cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At least three patients caught hepatitis C through treatments they received at Voepel’s office in Melbourne, Florida, according to an &lt;a href="https://mqa-internet.doh.state.fl.us/MQASearchServices/healthcareproviders/LicenseVerification?LicInd=81873&amp;amp;ProCde=1501"&gt;administrative complaint&lt;/a&gt; filed against the doctor by the health department. The department’s subsequent investigation found “several deficiencies in the facility’s hygiene and sterilization procedures” at the office. The office’s license has been temporarily suspended, and Voepel is on the hook for a hefty fine.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;“Unsafe infection control practices”&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The health department first &lt;a href="https://brevard.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2025/04/doh-brevard-notifies-public-of-potential-hepatitis-exposure-2025-04-11.html"&gt;notified&lt;/a&gt; the public about the potential hepatitis C exposure at Voepel’s office earlier this April, warning patients about “unsafe infection control practices” that might have occurred during their time there. People who visited the office between June 2023 and March 2025 were advised to get testing for the bloodborne viral disease as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Hepatitis C is an often chronic, potentially life-shortening infection. It can be transmitted through sex or improperly sterilized and/or shared needles. Though most people won’t experience any symptoms early on, the virus can wreak havoc on the liver over time. Without treatment, chronic infections can cause cirrhosis and significantly raise the risk of liver cancer. Thankfully, the once lifelong infection is now almost always curable with antiviral therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the department’s &lt;a href="https://mqa-internet.doh.state.fl.us/MQASearchServices/Document"&gt;complaint&lt;/a&gt; against Voepel, they laid out multiple health code and other violations discovered during an inspection of Voepel’s office conducted this past March.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Among other things, inspectors found expired drugs and defibrillator pads, out-of-date manuals, and no risk management program in place. The office also failed to have adequate sterilization equipment, such as a handwashing station that could sterilize surgeons’ hands before a procedure. And the office was not properly registered as a pain-management clinic with the health department, yet it advertised itself as such.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A hefty punishment&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a result of the department’s investigation, Voepel agreed to having her office’s surgery registration license suspended for six months, starting October 15, along with having to pay a $2,000 fine. She will also have to pay $18,000 to reimburse the department’s costs in pursuing and investigating the case.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The physician will additionally have to undergo several continuing education courses on infection control, risk management, and ethics. And she will have to provide a written plan to the health department on how her office has changed to comply with the rules moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

But how short is &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; short?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-01547" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Annals of Internal Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; suggests that—at least for heart health—you may want to set aside at least 10 minutes at a time when it comes to your daily walks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, this time frame isn’t long, but it does challenge the idea that grabbing a few steps here and there is all it takes to ward off your risk of cardiovascular issues. Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/christopher-j-berg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Christopher Berg, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Christopher Berg, MD&lt;/a&gt;, is a cardiologist at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA. &lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/emmanuel-stamatakis.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Emmanuel Stamatakis, PhD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Emmanuel Stamatakis, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, is the study co-author and professor of physical activity, lifestyle, and population health at The University of Sydney. &lt;a href="https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/en/persons/bdelpozocruz/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Borja del Pozo Cruz, PhD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Borja del Pozo Cruz, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, is the lead study author and a professor in the Department of Sports Science and Clinical Biomechanics at the University of Southern Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers analyzed data from 33,560 people between the ages of 40 and 79 who walked fewer than 8,000 steps a day and had no history of cardiovascular disease or cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants wore fitness trackers for a week to track their step counts and how those steps were distributed during the day. After that, the researchers followed the participants’ health for about eight years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that people who walked continuously for 10 to 15 minutes a day had about a 4% risk of a cardiovascular event such as a heart attack or stroke, compared to 13% in those who strolled for only about five minutes at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perks were the biggest for people who were the least active overall (namely, those who took 5,000 or fewer steps a day). In this group, the risk of developing cardiovascular disease dropped from 15% for short walkers to 7% in those who walked up to 15 minutes at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why might longer walks be better?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are likely a few things going on here. “Most walking in this study was of light intensity,” says &lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/emmanuel-stamatakis.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Emmanuel Stamatakis, PhD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Emmanuel Stamatakis, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, study co-author and professor of physical activity, lifestyle, and population health at The University of Sydney. “When you walk for 10 to 15 minutes or longer without stopping, your heart and lungs get a chance to work continuously.” This “steady-state” activity helps your body use oxygen more efficiently, improving your circulation in the process, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can be especially helpful in people who are usually inactive, says &lt;a href="https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/en/persons/bdelpozocruz/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Borja del Pozo Cruz, PhD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Borja del Pozo Cruz, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, lead study author and a professor in the Department of Sports Science and Clinical Biomechanics at the University of Southern Denmark. “To gain cardiovascular benefits, the body needs either sufficient volume (more total activity) or intensity (higher effort per minute) and continuous walking achieves a combination of both, even at moderate speeds,” del Pozo Cruz says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, walking in shorter bursts with a lower level of intensity doesn’t let your cardiovascular system “switch on” long enough to tease out these benefits, Stamatakis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this all makes sense in theory, keep in mind that the participants’ walking habits were only tracked for a week and that the study simply found a link between lower amounts of walking—it didn’t prove that walking less raised the risk of heart issues, says &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/christopher-j-berg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Christopher Berg, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Christopher Berg, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, how long do your walks actually need to be? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings don’t mean that exercise snacks aren’t worth it. “For people who are currently inactive, the first and most important step is simply to start moving—any increase in daily steps helps,” del Pozo Cruz says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But once you've done that, del Pozo Cruz suggests including longer, uninterrupted walks of at least 10 minutes at a brisk pace. Over time, you can ramp up the speed and duration of your walks, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Berg points out that this may take some planning on your end, whether it’s setting aside time at the end of your day to go for a walk or making a lunch date with a coworker to get moving around together. “Longer periods of walking are not going to happen by accident,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, pushing the amount of time and your pace is the best way to go, according to Stamatakis. “To get the most out of it, you either need to extend the length of the session or increase the intensity, one of the two,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 15:55:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxNeGwzMUFjSUR5N3RhSEl2TTBWVElJU2RkdjZZSmJYa0h5X25KcFVFV3RmR3JpRWdOeGpJdldZZ0gybWMwZzY5OGZ3NHhaUC1pVl9YdlRCVHpvaU1MWW5haUY5YjhNdDMzbXlkNUJOeXpHbDZzT2RWY1BjUzJJdUt5OWlSNA</guid></item><item><title>国情咨文：近三分之二的美国年轻人考虑移居国外- StudyFinds</title><link>https://studyfinds.org/young-americans-want-out-of-usa/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;&lt;div class="post-featured-image"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-in-4-admit-they-re-more-stressed-about-nation-s-future-than-before"&gt;3 In 4 Admit They’re More Stressed About Nation’s Future Than Before&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-group has-quaternary-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In A Nutshell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;63% of young adults&lt;/strong&gt; (ages 18-34) and &lt;strong&gt;53% of parents&lt;/strong&gt; have considered leaving the U.S. due to the state of the nation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Half of all adults&lt;/strong&gt; report signs of loneliness, while &lt;strong&gt;69%&lt;/strong&gt; say they needed more emotional support this year than they received&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI anxiety nearly doubled&lt;/strong&gt; among students (78%, up from 45%) and surged across all age groups in just one year&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;75% of Americans&lt;/strong&gt; are more stressed about the country’s future than before, with political division tied to isolation, physical symptoms, and daily struggles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most young Americans have considered leaving the country. Data from the American Psychological Association shows that 63% of adults ages 18 to 34 have considered relocating abroad this year because of the state of the nation. Among parents, more than half (53%) have had the same thought.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These aren’t knee-jerk reactions to a single news cycle or election outcome. The numbers come from the APA’s Stress in America 2025 survey, fielded Aug. 4–24, 2025, among more than 3,000 adults across the country, nearly a year after the 2024 election. While personal stress levels hover around 5 on a 1–10 scale on average, collective anxiety about the nation’s direction has reached a troubling high. Seventy-five percent of adults now say they’re more stressed about the country’s future than they used to be.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Political tensions show no signs of letting up. Seventy-six percent of adults call the future of the nation a significant source of stress, a number that has held steady since before the 2024 election, when it stood at 77%. The persistence of this anxiety, regardless of which party controls &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/why-painting-your-home-white-could-help-survive-heatwave/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the White House&lt;/a&gt; or Congress, suggests Americans are grappling with something deeper than partisan politics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-freedom-corruption-and-fear-how-americans-describe-their-country"&gt;Freedom, Corruption, and Fear: How Americans Describe Their Country&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked to choose words that best represent America today, survey respondents revealed a country wrestling with its own identity. “Freedom” topped the list at 41%, but “&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/why-george-washingtons-worries-about-americas-fate-coming-true/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;corruption&lt;/a&gt;” came in close behind at 38%. “Opportunity” hit 37%, while “division” landed at 36%. Hope and fear nearly tied at 35% and 32%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond abstract concerns, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/political-leaders-dark-personalities-drive-division-polarization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;societal division&lt;/a&gt; is hitting home in personal ways. Sixty-two percent of Americans call it a significant stressor in their lives, and that stress is associated with deeper feelings of isolation. Among adults who cited division as a major source of stress, 61% reported feeling isolated from others. Compare that to just 43% among those not stressed by division. Similar gaps showed up for feeling left out (57% versus 39%) and lacking companionship (54% versus 44%).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-growing-crisis-of-connection"&gt;A Growing Crisis of Connection&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Feelings of isolation aren’t limited to those stressed by political division. Across the board, roughly half of all American adults report signs of loneliness. Fifty-four percent said they’ve felt isolated from others, 50% have felt left out, and 50% said they lack companionship, at least some of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more troubling, 69% of adults said they needed more &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/best-dogs-for-emotional-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;emotional support &lt;/a&gt;over the past year than they actually received. That number is up from 65% in 2024, pointing to a widening gap between what people need and what they’re getting. Among those stressed by societal division, the unmet need for support climbs even higher, to 75%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adults experiencing high levels of loneliness were more likely to report living with chronic health conditions. Eighty percent of this group said they have a chronic illness, compared to 66% of those with moderate loneliness and 68% with low loneliness. Depression, anxiety disorders, and chronic pain were particularly common among those with high loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-political-stress-shows-up-in-the-body"&gt;When Political Stress Shows Up in the Body&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anxiety about national division doesn’t stay abstract for long. Among people who report significant stress over &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/a-nation-divided-u-s-politics-taking-physical-emotional-toll-on-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;societal division&lt;/a&gt;, 83% experienced at least one physical symptom of stress in the past month. For those not stressed by division, that number drops to 66%. The most common complaints included feeling nervous or anxious, fatigue, and headaches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stress over division also showed up in daily behavior. Adults in this group were more likely to have lost patience or &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/arguments-with-in-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;yelled at family members&lt;/a&gt; (60% versus 49%), canceled social plans (55% versus 37%), and found it hard to plan ahead (53% versus 37%).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Americans seem caught between competing views of progress. While 66% say they have more opportunities than previous generations, 64% believe their generation has made sacrifices others didn’t have to make.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-technology-anxiety-spikes-especially-around-ai"&gt;Technology Anxiety Spikes, Especially Around AI&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As Americans grapple with political and social stress, technology is adding a new layer of concern. Anxiety about artificial intelligence has surged dramatically in just one year. Fifty-seven percent of adults now cite &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the rise of AI &lt;/a&gt;as a significant source of stress, up from 49% in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Students have been hit particularly hard by AI-related worry. Seventy-eight percent reported stress about AI, nearly double the 45% from last year. Young adults ages 18 to 34 saw their anxiety jump from 52% to 65%. Parents are concerned too, with stress levels rising across age groups: 70% of parents with children ages 5 to 7 (up from 49%), 65% with kids ages 8 to 12 (up from 53%), and 62% with teenagers ages 13 to 17 (up from 53%).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The spread of inaccurate or misleading information is another growing concern. Sixty-nine percent of adults called misinformation a significant stressor, up from 62% the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other major sources of stress remain steady. Seventy-five percent cited the economy, 66% pointed to money concerns, and 65% mentioned U.S. politics, housing costs, and mass shootings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-americans-still-find-meaning"&gt;Where Americans Still Find Meaning&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite widespread worry about national politics, most people maintain a sense of control over their personal lives. Seventy-seven percent say they have a great deal or at least some control over their own futures. Seventy-four percent believe their personal dreams and goals are still within reach. An even larger majority, 84%, say they can create a good life for themselves, even if it looks different from what previous generations experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But obstacles are real. Eighty-five percent of adults cited barriers standing in the way of their dreams and goals, and 26% aren’t sure they’ll achieve what they hope for or don’t think it’s possible at all. For those who feel their dreams slipping away, the emotional toll is steep. Eighty-nine percent said their &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/midterms-political-events-sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; was a significant source of stress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked what makes life feel meaningful, relationships dominated. Ninety-two percent of adults pointed to connections with others as a source of purpose. Family topped the specific categories at 77%, followed by friendships at 62%, romantic relationships at 47%, and pets at 39%. Health and well-being came in at 59%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Work tells a different story. While 69% of employed adults call their jobs a significant source of stress, marking the highest level since the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/lifetime-lockdown-40-of-americans-will-avoid-public-spaces-long-after-coronavirus-pandemic-ends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;early days of the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; in May 2020, only 46% say work gives their life meaning. That gap between stress and fulfillment raises questions about how Americans balance productivity with purpose in an era where hustle culture remains dominant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/paycheck-income-debt-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;financial stability&lt;/a&gt; topped the list of personal goals at 64%, followed by maintaining or improving health at 60%. Spending time with family and friends came in at 53%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite anxiety about the nation’s trajectory, 65% of adults say they feel personally responsible for helping shape the country’s future. Parents feel this responsibility even more acutely, with 72% saying they have a duty to contribute to national direction, compared to 61% of non-parents. Seventy-three percent of all adults believe they can help steer the country toward something better.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The survey captures Americans navigating multiple crises at once: political division, social isolation, technological disruption, and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/your-2025-financial-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;economic uncertainty.&lt;/a&gt; Half of adults report feeling lonely or left out. More than two-thirds say they need more emotional support than they’re getting. Young people are stressed about AI at nearly double last year’s rate. And three-quarters are more worried about the country’s future than before, with many young adults and parents seriously weighing whether to leave.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet resilience persists. Most people still believe they can build meaningful lives, maintain control over their futures, and contribute to positive change. Whether that optimism can hold in the face of compounding pressures remains one of the most important questions facing American society.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-group has-quaternary-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-survey-design-and-sample"&gt;Survey Design and Sample&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 2025 Stress in America survey was conducted online by The Harris Poll on behalf of the American Psychological Association between August 4 and 24, 2025. The survey included 3,199 adults ages 18 and older living in the United States. The sample was designed to be nationally representative and included oversamples of specific racial and ethnic groups to allow for subgroup analysis: 800 Black adults, 809 Latino/a/e or Latinx adults, and 800 Asian adults. For Latino respondents, interviews were conducted in English or Spanish based on preference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-weighting-and-adjustments"&gt;Weighting and Adjustments&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data were weighted to reflect population proportions based on the March 2024 Current Population Survey by the U.S. Census Bureau, as well as data from PEW research studies on internet use, political affiliation, and language use. Weighting variables included age by gender, race and ethnicity, education, region, household income, frequency of internet use, and political party affiliation. Latino/a/e or Latinx adults were additionally weighted for acculturation, taking into account household language and ability to read and speak English and Spanish. Country of origin (U.S. or non-U.S.) was also included for Latino/a/e or Latinx and Asian subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sampling-precision"&gt;Sampling Precision&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Respondents were selected from among individuals who have agreed to participate in Harris surveys. The sampling precision is measured using a Bayesian credible interval. For the full national sample, data is accurate to within plus or minus 2.5 percentage points at a 95% confidence level. For racial and ethnic subsamples, the credible intervals are wider: plus or minus 4.9 percentage points for the Black sample, plus or minus 5.2 percentage points for the Latino/a/e or Latinx sample, and plus or minus 5.1 percentage points for the Asian sample.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As with all surveys, this study is subject to multiple sources of error that cannot be fully quantified, including coverage error, nonresponse error, question wording and response option effects, and post-survey weighting adjustments. The survey also used the UCLA Three-Item Loneliness Scale to measure loneliness levels, assigning numerical values to responses about feeling isolated, left out, or lacking companionship, then grouping respondents into high, moderate, or low loneliness categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her daily pain, fatigue and brain fog wax and wane. Worse are “flares,” when symptoms abruptly and markedly worsen. For Wilson, they bring sudden high fevers, legs too swollen to walk, more intense pain. They impact her job at a medical lab and time with her husband, teen son and college-age daughter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wilson learned too much sunshine is one of her triggers. So a family visit to the beach means lots of sunscreen, a big hat and long sleeves.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Whenever a flare strikes, Wilson pricks her finger for a blood sample. It’s part of a study led by the Lupus Research Alliance to better understand the disease’s variations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-fullwidth&gt;

She saved her life by begging for one more test in an emergency room about to send her home, again, without answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That last-ditch test found the Massachusetts woman’s kidneys were failing. The culprit? Her &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/autoimmune-lupus-women-rheumatoid-arthritis-aff0e28dece3ef4168f301bd84331ea5"&gt;immune system had been attacking her own body&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; all that time and nobody caught it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just wish there was a better way that patients could get that diagnosis without having to go through all of the pain and all of, like, the dismissiveness and the gaslighting,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson has lupus, nicknamed the disease of 1,000 faces for its variety of symptoms — and her journey offers a snapshot of the dark side of the immune system. Lupus is one of a rogues’ gallery of &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/nobel-prize-medicine-a68cf8a3b930570630168a949d277cde"&gt;autoimmune diseases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that affect as many as 50 million Americans and millions more worldwide – hard to treat, on the rise and one of medicine’s biggest mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Now, building on discoveries from cancer research and the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists are decoding the biology behind these debilitating illnesses. They’re uncovering pathways that lead to different autoimmune diseases and connections between seemingly unrelated ones – in hopes of attacking the causes, not just the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list goes on: A new count from the National Institutes of Health tallied 140 autoimmune conditions, many rare but altogether a leading cause of chronic disease that’s often invisible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You look normal. People see you and they don’t think you have this horrible disease,” said Wilson, 43, who balances her illness with volunteering to help educate the public and even doctors about life with lupus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-fullwidth&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there’s still an enormous amount to learn, recent steps have some specialists daring to wonder if just maybe, ways to cure or prevent at least some of these diseases are getting closer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In dozens of clinical trials, scientists are harnessing some of patients’ own immune cells to wipe out wayward ones that fuel lupus and a growing list of other diseases. It’s called CAR-T therapy and early results with these “living drugs” are promising. The first lupus patient was treated in Germany in March 2021 and remains in drug-free remission, the researchers said last month.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;And a drug named teplizumab can delay the start of Type 1 diabetes symptoms in people destined to get sick, buying some time before they’ll need insulin. Citing that “tantalizing evidence,” the NIH’s new five-year plan for autoimmune research — if it gets funded — urges pursuing similar windows to intervene in other simmering diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is probably the most exciting time that we’ve ever had to be in autoimmunity,” said Dr. Amit Saxena, a rheumatologist at NYU Langone Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Inside job&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-fullwidth&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your immune system has multiple overlapping ways to detect and attack bacteria, viruses or other bad actors. That includes teaching key soldiers -- T cells and antibody-producing B cells — how to distinguish what’s foreign from what’s “you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a delicate balancing act, especially considering germs sometimes adapt features similar to human molecules so they can confuse and sneak past immune defenses. And while the immune system has built-in safeguards to curtail any misbehaving cells, autoimmune diseases set in when the system gets off-kilter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous genes involved in different immune functions can make people susceptible to common autoimmune diseases. That means if one family member is sick, others may be at increased risk. Such genes can include variants that &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/multiple-sclerosis-ancient-dna-c8fbfe4ba7d4e2447eec52c6000878dc"&gt;once protected our ancestors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from long-ago threats including the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/oddities-science-health-plague-bubonic-04349f994460d01c56fe5a57960b6ce8"&gt;Black Death&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; but that today can translate into a hyperactive immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;But “genes are not everything,” said Dr. Mariana Kaplan of NIH’s National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies show if one identical twin develops an autoimmune disease, the other isn’t guaranteed to get sick. Non-genetic factors that trigger an immune response play a big role, such as infections, certain medicines, smoking, pollutants. In lupus, even a bad sunburn is suspect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At some point there is a second or third hit and the immune system says, ‘That’s it, I can’t handle any more of these insults,’” said Kaplan, who directs systemic autoimmunity research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And women are more likely to get autoimmune diseases than men, maybe because of estrogen or their extra X chromosome. That’s especially evident in lupus; women account for 90% of cases, often young ones like Wilson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-fullwidth&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/template&gt;
    
&lt;/bsp-figure&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fainting spells and body-wide rashes began in her 20s and intensified with two pregnancies. Youngsters in tow, she saw a variety of doctors for fevers, swelling, joint and back pain until that fateful ER visit when she requested a urine test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Months of grueling treatment saved her kidneys. But over a decade later, the Littleton, Massachusetts, woman still lives with daily pain from lupus. Deep fatigue and brain fog — difficulty with concentrating, short-term recall, multitasking — wax and wane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapies have improved in recent years, from high-dose steroids and drugs that broadly suppress the immune system to include additional options that focus on specific molecules. Wilson gets a monthly lupus-targeted IV treatment and takes about six daily medicines to calm her overactive immune system and related symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Worse are what are called flares, when symptoms abruptly and markedly worsen. For Wilson, they bring sudden high fevers, legs too swollen to walk, more intense pain, lasting days to a week. They impact her job at a medical lab and time with her husband, teen son and college-age daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not a bad life, it’s just a bad day,” she tells herself to get through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaplan, the NIH scientist, has a biological explanation for the daily slog: The same inflammatory proteins that cause aches and fatigue during a cold or flu continually course through the bodies of patients with systemic autoimmune diseases like lupus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hunting the root causes&lt;/h2&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“These are my babies,” said Dr. Justin Kwong, a research fellow in Kaplan’s lab at NIH, as he carefully examines cells in an incubator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kwong is performing something so tricky it’s not done in many laboratories: He’s growing batches of neutrophils, the body’s most common white blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are first responders that race to the site of an injury or infection, and Kaplan suspects they’re among the earliest immune cells to run amok and trigger certain autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How? Some types of neutrophils spew out their insides to form sticky spider-web like structures that trap and kill germs. The neutrophils die in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;But patients with lupus and some other diseases harbor abnormal neutrophils that form too many webs, Kaplan said. Her team is investigating if other immune defenses mistakenly sense the resulting debris as foreign, sparking a chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think that’s a fundamental initial process,” Kaplan said. “We’re trying to find why it happens, why it happens more often in women, and can we come up with strategies to stop this without harming the way we defend ourselves from infections.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another common feature: Patients with a number of autoimmune diseases, especially women, often suffer heart attacks and strokes at unusually young ages. Kaplan’s research suggests those aptly named NETS, or neutrophil extracellular traps, may be key — by damaging blood vessels and spurring hardened arteries typically seen in older people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But neutrophils don’t live long outside the body and testing mature ones from lupus patients’ blood won’t show how they went awry — something Kwong’s baby neutrophils may aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Teasing apart patient differences&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-fullwidth&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever triggers it, lupus has bafflingly varied symptoms and treatments that can keep some patients symptom-free but not others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That suggests “lupus is not a single disease,” Kaplan said. “What we call lupus probably represents many different conditions that have some common factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to subtype lupus isn’t clear. But another disease, rheumatoid arthritis, may offer clues. Perhaps best recognized by painfully disfigured fingers, RA can attack any joint and even some organs, sometimes scarring lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like with lupus, RA treatment is trial-and-error and scientists are exploring different underlying factors to explain why. In one study, an international team used tiny samples of patients’ joint tissue to identify six inflammatory subtypes of RA based on patterns of cells, how they clustered and their activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It “changed how we think about the disease,” said Northwestern University rheumatology chief Harris Perlman, one of the coauthors. Now researchers are comparing cells in joint tissue before and after patients start a new drug to see if they could help guide treatment choices, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Living with lupus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-fullwidth&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson learned to wear sunscreen and a big hat outdoors and how to ration her energy in hopes of avoiding flares. When her kids were old enough for school, she returned, too, getting degrees that led to laboratory research and data science jobs — and a better understanding of her own disease and its treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day her then-rheumatologist asked if she’d answer some medical students’ questions. Wilson remembers many knew “what lupus looks like in a textbook” but not the patient perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I realized, my god, I need to start talking about this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What that looks like now: One evening last February, Wilson bubbled with nerves and excitement at finally meeting some members of her online lupus support group. At UMass Chan Medical School, Wilson greeted the two women and two men with hugs. They shared symptoms and treatments — and rueful stories of well-meaning relatives urging them to just get more sleep to combat the lupus fatigue that rest can’t conquer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A month later, Wilson traveled to Washington for a meeting organized by the Lupus Research Alliance, where she urged scientists and drug company researchers to heed patient reports of changes in their everyday lives, such as whether a new therapy helps brain fog.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Drug studies that measure physical symptoms and blood markers are “only capturing half the story,” she said. “If a treatment allows me to think clearly, to engage in my life, to be the person I know I am beneath all of this, then that is just as important as reducing inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While her doctor isn’t recommending experimental treatments yet, Wilson recently joined the Lupus Landmark Study that will track biological samples from 3,500 patients to better understand disease variations. Whenever a flare strikes Wilson pricks her finger for a blood sample to share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important for me to also be a voice for patients because I think of myself and how lonely I was at the very beginning,” Wilson said. For a long time, “I never wanted to talk about it. Especially my kids, I wanted them to know that I was going to be OK. And so you put on your makeup and your lipstick and your three shades of eye corrector and you go on.”&lt;/p&gt;

The research indicates that the strength of this relationship is partly explained by an individual’s sensitivity to potential social threats. The findings were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2025.113454" target="_blank"&gt;Personality and Individual Differences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has explored connections between shyness and brain regions involved in emotion and social processing, such as the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala. However, findings have been inconsistent, leaving the specific neural architecture of shyness unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One prominent model suggests shyness emerges from a conflict between the motivation to approach social situations and the motivation to avoid them. To investigate this, researchers often use the concepts of the Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) and the Behavioral Activation System (BAS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BIS is associated with avoidance motivation, making individuals more sensitive to potential punishment or negative outcomes, while the BAS is tied to approach motivation and sensitivity to rewards. The present study aimed to connect these motivational systems to the spontaneous, or resting-state, brain activity associated with shyness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Shyness is a common personality trait, but its neural basis has remained elusive. Most existing research has focused on the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, while the role of the cerebellum—traditionally viewed as a ‘motor’ region—has been largely overlooked,” said study author Hong Li, a psychology professor at South China Normal University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yet recent evidence shows that the cerebellum also contributes to emotion and social processing. We wanted to understand whether the cerebellum plays a meaningful role in shyness and how motivational systems—especially the Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS), which governs our sensitivity to threat—might link brain activity to shy behavior. This question bridges an important gap between biological mechanisms and everyday emotional experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 42 healthy university students. Participants completed questionnaires to measure their levels of trait shyness. They also filled out surveys to assess the sensitivity of their Behavioral Inhibition System and Behavioral Activation System. For example, a high BIS score might reflect agreement with a statement like, “If I think something unpleasant is going to happen, I usually get pretty ‘worked up.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant also underwent a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan. This technique measures brain activity while a person is at rest and not performing any specific task, allowing scientists to observe the brain’s baseline or spontaneous neural patterns. The researchers then analyzed the fMRI data using a method called Regional Homogeneity, or ReHo. This technique measures the degree of synchronized activity among neighboring points in the brain, essentially gauging the local functional harmony within a specific area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis first looked for direct correlations between shyness scores and ReHo values across the entire brain. The results pointed to a significant association in one particular area: the right posterior lobe of the cerebellum. Specifically, individuals who reported higher levels of shyness tended to have lower ReHo values in this region. This suggests that greater shyness is associated with less synchronized local neural activity in this part of the cerebellum when the brain is at rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No other brain regions showed a significant relationship with shyness in this analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We initially expected the prefrontal cortex to play a stronger role, given previous findings,” Li told PsyPost. “Instead, the cerebellum showed a clear and specific association with shyness. This was surprising and exciting—it suggests that the cerebellum contributes not only to coordination and timing, but also to the fine-tuning of emotional and social responses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also examined the relationships between the personality measures. They found that shyness scores were strongly and positively correlated with scores on the Behavioral Inhibition System. This aligns with the idea that shy individuals tend to be more sensitive to potential threats and social punishments. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between shyness and the Behavioral Activation System, which relates to reward-seeking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these connections established, the team performed a mediation analysis to see if the BIS or BAS could explain the link between cerebellar activity and shyness. This statistical method examines whether one factor helps explain the relationship between two others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed that the Behavioral Inhibition System did indeed play a mediating role. The data suggest that lower synchronized activity in the right posterior cerebellum is associated with a more sensitive behavioral inhibition system, which in turn is linked to higher levels of shyness. The BIS appears to function as a partial bridge connecting the neural pattern to the personality trait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Behavioral Activation System, on the other hand, did not show any significant mediating effect. This result provides evidence that shyness may be more strongly driven by avoidance and inhibition motivations than by a lack of approach or reward-seeking motivations. The findings refine the motivational conflict model of shyness, pointing to the primary influence of the brain’s threat-detection system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results show that people who are more shy tend to have lower spontaneous neural activity in a specific part of the cerebellum (the right posterior lobe),” Li explained. “This relationship is partly explained by higher activity in the Behavioral Inhibition System, which makes people more cautious or anxious in social situations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In simpler terms, shyness may not just come from “overthinking” or lack of confidence—it might also reflect how certain brain systems regulate our sensitivity to potential social threat. This understanding can help us view shyness not as a flaw, but as a meaningful difference in how the brain balances safety and connection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study does have some limitations to consider. The sample size was relatively modest and consisted only of university students, which may limit how broadly the findings can be applied to the general population. The study’s cross-sectional design identifies associations between brain activity and personality, but it cannot establish a direct causal relationship. It remains unclear whether the brain patterns contribute to shyness or if experiences related to shyness shape the brain over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important not to interpret these findings as showing that shyness is ’caused’ by a single brain region,” Li noted. “The cerebellum does not make someone shy by itself. Rather, shyness arises from complex interactions among brain systems, personality, and experience. Our data are correlational, so we can’t infer direct causality—but they point to a promising direction for future longitudinal and experimental research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the effect sizes in our mediation model are moderate—indicating a partial but meaningful role for the BIS in linking cerebellar activity to shyness—readers should view them as foundational rather than definitive, given our exploratory approach and sample size. Practically, this suggests that targeting the BIS through therapies could have tangible benefits for reducing shyness, though the effects might vary across individuals; it’s not a ‘cure-all’ but a stepping stone toward personalized interventions that could improve social functioning in everyday contexts like work or relationships.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also noted that resting-state fMRI captures only one aspect of brain function. Incorporating task-based fMRI, where participants engage in social tasks during the scan, could provide a more complete picture of the neural processes at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are currently planning to explore how training or modulation of the cerebellum and BIS-related circuits might reduce excessive social inhibition,” Li explained. “For example, neurofeedback and real-time fMRI could be used to help individuals gain more control over their behavioral inhibition responses. We also aim to examine different subtypes of shyness—such as ‘positive shyness’ and ‘fearful shyness’—to see whether they involve distinct neural patterns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hope this study encourages people to think about shyness with greater compassion. Being shy does not mean being socially deficient—it often reflects a heightened sensitivity to social cues and a desire to interact carefully and meaningfully. Understanding the brain basis of shyness helps us appreciate it as a form of emotional intelligence, rather than simply a barrier to overcome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2025.113454" target="_blank"&gt;Associations between trait shyness and cerebellar spontaneous neural activity are mediated by behavioral inhibition&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Liang Li, Yujie Zhang, Benjamin Becker, and Hong Li.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 13:11:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxOaXh5SVh6bWh1bWJOdmdHQmlHWERMUkFBdFI3TWVRZlJ0TU11RUNmTlpvaDJWLU9LN3llZ1k1UVFuU2FDb05CVGhMNk5UNHFZNldNTWhXa2hIcmFzMmozaGo2YWJiYk5XWl9tSjhpRld1aWczZ1o1OFRnT29jSnlfSjY4NjFtZXoxTFU4b3R6SXJyZw</guid></item><item><title>当雷暴袭来时，哮喘会变成急诊室的噩梦- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/thunderstorms-could-turn-your-asthma-into-a-nightmare-2000682082</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl prose-science dark:prose-science"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Has your asthma ever acted up during or shortly after stormy weather? Turns out, there’s a perfectly good reason for that. Research out today links thunderstorms to worsening asthma attacks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors at the University of Kansas Medical Center examined emergency department data from hospitals in the area. On days when a storm took place, they found, the typical number of asthma-related ER visits was substantially higher than on non-storm days. The findings suggest that people with asthma should take extra precautions when thunder is in the immediate forecast, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The main takeaway is awareness,” lead author Diala Merheb, an internal medicine resident at KUMC, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Thunderstorm asthma&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There have been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7501467/#:~:text=Clear%20published%20reports%20of%20thunderstorm%20asthma%20date%20back%20to%20the%20early%201980s%2C2%2C3%20with%20more%20than%20twenty%20distinct%20occurrences%20now%20recognized"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; of “thunderstorm asthma” epidemics dating back to the 1980s, which seem to more affect people with seasonal allergies, or hay fever. But the most dramatic incident yet occurred nearly a decade ago in Melbourne, Australia. In late November 2016, a thunderstorm &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(18)30120-7/fulltext"&gt;appeared&lt;/a&gt; to cause a surge of asthma attacks that sent over 3,000 people to the emergency room, hospitalized nearly 500 residents, and killed at least 10.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Numerous studies have documented the phenomenon internationally since, including some in the U.S. According to Merheb, though, theirs is the first research to look for this link between thunderstorms and asthma in Wichita, Kansas, specifically. Importantly, Wichita is already known for having high rates of seasonal pollen allergy, and it’s currently the &lt;a href="https://aafa.org/asthma-allergy-research/allergy-capitals/"&gt;top-ranked&lt;/a&gt; city on the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA)’s list of “allergy capitals.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed five years’ worth of ER data from three hospitals in Wichita, from January 2020 to December 2024. This data was then cross-referenced with meteorologic records of the area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Across those five years, about 4,500 ER visits related to asthma were documented, while 38 storm days occurred in the region, encompassing just 2% of the total days during the study period. But a whopping 14.1% of all asthma-related ER visits took place on those storm days, the researchers found. On average, there were nearly 18 ER visits related to asthma per day during thunderstorms, compared to roughly three ER visits a day when it wasn’t storming.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team is &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1103520"&gt;presenting&lt;/a&gt; its research this week at the annual meeting of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. That means their work is preliminary for the time being, since the study hasn’t been published in a peer-reviewed journal yet. The authors also note that their results can only show a correlation between thunderstorms and asthma.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;At the same time, the findings are only the latest to find a connection between these two things. “While this doesn’t prove cause and effect, it suggests that thunderstorm conditions, such as changes in wind or pollen dispersion, may play a role in triggering flare-ups,” Merheb said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What does this mean for people with asthma?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given what Merheb and others have found, it seems prudent for people with asthma and the doctors who treat them to be more cognizant of the potential risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For people living with asthma, knowing that certain weather conditions can increase risk allows for more proactive management like keeping up with controller medications, and carrying rescue inhalers,” she said. “For clinicians, it reinforces the importance of discussing environmental triggers with their patients as part of routine asthma care.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Ironically enough, mild rain showers can actually &lt;a href="https://community.aafa.org/blog/how-does-rain-affect-pollen-levels"&gt;lower&lt;/a&gt; people’s risk of seasonal allergies by simply washing away the pollen in the environment. Conversely, the causes of thunderstorm asthma appear to be more complex. Past research has &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7501467/#:~:text=The%20meteorological%20activity,smaller%2C%20respirable%20size."&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; the strong winds of a thunderstorm can kick pollen or mold high up in the air, while the added electrical activity or moisture during a storm can break apart this pollen into smaller fragments more likely to cause a serious allergic reaction when inhaled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the arrival of a thunderstorm alone isn’t enough to routinely cause the sort of huge asthma surges seen during the 2016 Melbourne event. So there’s certainly more research needed to figure out the exact drivers of thunderstorm asthma— research that the authors are already looking to conduct.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“We’re hoping to build on these findings by looking more closely at local weather and environmental variables, things like wind patterns, humidity, and pollen data, to better understand what combination of factors might drive these events,” Merheb said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, if you have asthma and you see a thunderstorm on the way, that should give you even more motivation to stay firmly indoors if you can.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

They don't want to be in a human," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We have to continually monitor the virus, because it's an influenza virus and influenza viruses change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Even when they're happy in a species such as birds they still undergo changes. They make mistakes and errors when they replicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"So that could always spew out a variant that might be more infectious for humans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The UK's chief veterinary officer Christine Middlemiss urged all bird keepers to comply with the new housing measures and to continue to exercise "robust biosecurity measures, remain alert for any signs of disease and report suspected disease immediately to the Animal and Plant Health Agency".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I appreciate the impact these measures have on industry and am extremely grateful for the continued cooperation of the poultry sector," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We know from previous years that housing birds will bring the rates of infection down from the high we are currently experiencing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The British Poultry Council's chief executive, Richard Griffiths, said the housing order was "the right move at the right time" while Gary Ford, from the British Free Range Egg Producers Association, said it gave "the clarity and consistency that producers have been calling for".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 12:07:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE55bThidVF0WnN4ZkxnekFhN2Z5WXlsNk53NFl4clppV2dETUw1cjBvcW9keDFhZzVpTmt0d2dfMXdMdGJOLWFENHZlOVpfZ2NMLTUzZzZKcFVYd9IBX0FVX3lxTE01ajN1WXQzS2lCVl93U3NXcUsyLWtoLTN6QmVITjRvOTNIUDZha2N6aF9tVVJ5SzNvWTVoOW5BVE9lQjdDaWp1OVVSWG8wOWVmYVllZmF6MHlNbnZsRENV</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现2种现有药物可逆转小鼠阿尔茨海默氏症脑损伤- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer-drugs-show-alzheimers-promise-in-mice</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

When used in tandem, the drugs were shown to reverse some of the brain changes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-disease-harms-the-brain-in-2-distinct-phases-study-reveals"&gt;brought on by the disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The harmful clumps of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_protein"&gt;tau protein&lt;/a&gt; that build up in brains affected by Alzheimer's were reduced significantly, and the mice showed improvements in learning and memory tasks – two brain capabilities often impaired by Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining the two drugs, the researchers were able to target different types of brain cells affected by the disease. Letrozole seemed to counter Alzheimer's in neurons, while irinotecan worked in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glia"&gt;glia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Alzheimer's is likely the result of numerous alterations in many genes and proteins that, together, disrupt brain health," &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/07/430386/do-these-two-cancer-drugs-have-what-it-takes-beat-alzheimers"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Yadong Huang, from UC San Francisco and Gladstone Institutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This makes it very challenging for drug development – which traditionally produces one drug for a single gene or protein that drives disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a promising start, but there's more work to be done: Obviously the drugs have only been directly tested in mice so far, and these medications also come with &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/letrozole/side-effects-of-letrozole/"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt;.

The borough was &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/epi/databrief65.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;once known&lt;/a&gt; for the highest rate of overdose deaths in the city, before being outpaced by the Bronx. Its overdose rate is now the second lowest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="f7tq4"&gt;With just under 500,000 residents, Staten Island is dealing with an overall smaller population of drug users than other boroughs. On Staten Island, 81 people died of overdoses last year, down from 157 in 2023. Overdoses killed more than 2,000 residents last year citywide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="co40p"&gt;Hotspotting was developed as a partnership between MIT and a coalition of Staten Island health care providers. It uses an AI-driven algorithm to help identify individuals at the highest risk of overdosing based on their medical history, justice involvement and a wide range of other factors. The district attorney’s office and local health organizations can also refer people to the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="bhai"&gt;Peers with their own history with substance use then actively reach out to those identified to ask about their needs — whether that’s housing, treatment, Narcan or anything else — and help coordinate care. The program uses regular check-ins and an app with monetary incentives to help keep clients on track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="d01jg"&gt;More than 600 drug users have been engaged in the program so far. Between April 2022 and April 2024, four of those clients died of overdoses, compared with 25 individuals in a control group, according to reports published by the Staten Island Performing Provider System, the health care coalition that runs the program. There was also a dramatic drop in emergency room visits among those who participated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="9ogsp"&gt;Drug policy researchers haven’t definitively identified what is behind the nationwide drop in overdose deaths, or why some areas are seeing bigger improvements than others, though they say investments in programs to reduce the harms of drug use and connect people to care are likely helping to move the needle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="52k1k"&gt;Joseph Conte, executive director of the Staten Island Performing Provider System, called the proactive outreach baked into the hotspotting program a “paradigm shift” on Staten Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8g41"&gt;Others working on the program said it has also been part of a broader effort to coordinate among different health care providers and agencies that might come into contact with people at risk of overdosing and address gaps in care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7mdrm"&gt;Germoso said he is sometimes connected to people who are already in an outpatient drug treatment program but are still using illicit drugs and may need a connection to mental health care or other services to really turn things around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="boa0v"&gt;Staten Island has its own challenges when it comes to addressing the overdose crisis, including the fact that many people are more isolated from services than in other parts of the city, said Donna Demarest, the director of harm reduction at Community Health Action of Staten Island, which participates in the hotspotting program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="bkl9"&gt;But she said the island’s insular nature also makes it easier for different organizations to unite around a single initiative like hotspotting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="b7mvk"&gt;The program is now expanding. NYC Health and Hospitals announced earlier this year it would try it out as part of a new pilot program at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx — the borough that currently has the highest rate of overdose deaths in the city — with the help of $600,000 in funding from the Robin Hood Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 11:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOZlZlMVM2NEJMb3NGbFFVYmYzZGZGMXlobzhBdzNVcDdhUUxROEhBUHdGd1NDSG5qYW5JTGYyUU5TV3FhMDAxMDV2bDhYMkFsR3dNZEdSOEJzQUFWeF9yUUZ5a2g1ZnJGVy1SaUJNNFExZ3BZOWQzZlQ3LVV5Q3RiM0xIYmtHamlQNl9aWlZlaUdPbzJtMXpYY1IxNUV3VU1acHRqbA</guid></item><item><title>英国面临漫长而艰难的流感季节， NHS酋长警告- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8r01ykl0xgo</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 idLnWK"&gt;UK facing long, tough flu season, NHS chiefs warn&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-7bfdb3c2-0 fYJjWP"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-7bfdb3c2-11 ljQVMv"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors-contributor-0" class="sc-7bfdb3c2-5 xGeVU"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="sc-7bfdb3c2-7 djOqvY"&gt;Nick Triggle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors-contributor-0-role-location" class="sc-7bfdb3c2-8 gvcwmG"&gt;Health correspondent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 eRlINq"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251105-121702-1a3e907763-web-2.33.1-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e238/live/277194e0-bafe-11f0-9758-995af3ef9daa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e238/live/277194e0-bafe-11f0-9758-995af3ef9daa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e238/live/277194e0-bafe-11f0-9758-995af3ef9daa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e238/live/277194e0-bafe-11f0-9758-995af3ef9daa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e238/live/277194e0-bafe-11f0-9758-995af3ef9daa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e238/live/277194e0-bafe-11f0-9758-995af3ef9daa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e238/live/277194e0-bafe-11f0-9758-995af3ef9daa.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e238/live/277194e0-bafe-11f0-9758-995af3ef9daa.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images Woman with umbrella sneezing" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The UK is facing a long, drawn-out flu season, the boss of the NHS in England is warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Sir Jim Mackey said there is "no doubt" this winter will be one of the toughest the health service has faced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It comes as flu rates have started climbing early this year, which is causing concern because the winter vaccination campaign has only just got under way and there are lots of vulnerable people yet to get protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;NHS England is issuing a "flu jab SOS", urging those eligible for the free vaccine to come forward quickly for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;More than 13 million people have been vaccinated so far this year, but that is still more than 5 million below the number who were jabbed last winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Sir Jim said: "There's no doubt this winter will be one of the toughest our staff have ever faced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Since stepping into this role, the thought of a long, drawn-out flu season has kept me awake at night.

                Some 3.5 million chickens, turkeys and ducks have had to be destroyed because of bird flu outbreaks in the last 30 days.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;As birds fly south for the winter, they're carrying with them some unwelcome cargo: the H5N1 virus, or bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the past 30 days, the virus has struck &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks" target="_blank"&gt;66 poultry flocks&lt;/a&gt;, leading to the deaths of more than 3.5 million turkeys, chickens and ducks, a steep increase compared to the summer months. The virus can spread easily when infected wild birds mix with commercial or backyard flocks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At the moment, states in the middle of the country are hardest hit. But scientists expect more outbreaks in other parts of the country, given bird migratory patterns.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If not taken seriously, the fallout could lead to more than high egg prices. Influenza researchers fear a replay of last year when, for the first time, the U.S. saw close to 70 human cases, including one death.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Absolutely we're going to see human infections, just like we did a year ago," says &lt;a href="https://med.emory.edu/departments/microbiology-immunology/research/labs/lakdawala/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Seema Lakdawala&lt;/a&gt;, a virologist at Emory University who studies bird flu. "Nothing has changed substantially to suggest otherwise."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And though no human cases have been reported since early this year, scientists involved in tracking the virus say they don't have good visibility into what's happening in animals or humans. That's because the federal government has scaled back on surveillance and communication.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We're not in a great position for monitoring things," says &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dMQpsskAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;Wendy Puryear&lt;/a&gt;, a virologist at Tufts University. &lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;I've been deep in the weeds since it arrived here in the U.S., and I'm finding myself in a very uncomfortable place."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Scaled back federal response&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Puryear says a &lt;a href="https://www.ceirr-network.org" target="_blank"&gt;network of influenza&lt;/a&gt; researchers used to be in constant contact with their counterparts at federal health agencies about H5N1, mapping out research priorities and discussing changes in the virus.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But now, she says, &lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;much of that infrastructure has been either completely closed down or significantly hampered," under the Trump administration, due to cutbacks in staffing, early retirements and other policies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In fact, Puryear recalls a recent meeting that consisted entirely of her colleagues announcing they'd had to halt their studies related to H5N1 in humans because of the administration's funding cuts.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It was a pretty depressing meeting," she says. "Just one person after another was closing their doors."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another pressing issue: Data coming from the federally-run lab that does genetic sequencing of virus collected from infected animals has slowed to a trickle, something that was true even before the government shutdown, says &lt;a href="https://www.vetmed.wisc.edu/people/poulsenk/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Keith Poulsen&lt;/a&gt;, who runs the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says loss of staff at the U.S. Department of Agriculture — and the fact that communication with scientists needs to be "pre-approved" — has created obstacles, at a time when the threat of spillover from wildlife is increasing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The shutdown has only exacerbated the situation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, the network of veterinary labs that's responsible for testing ceased its regular meetings because of the shutdown, Poulsen says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The shutdown just kind of pours gas on a smoldering fire and makes us vulnerable," he says. "It's a national security issue."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;USDA did not reply to a request for comment. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's influenza team was not affected by cutbacks and that response to urgent public health threats can continue during a shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A difficult virus to contain on farms&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Based on reported data, cases in dairy herds &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock" target="_blank"&gt;appear to be relatively rare&lt;/a&gt; in recent months. A &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/livestock/nmts" target="_blank"&gt;USDA program&lt;/a&gt; set up during the Biden administration to detect bird flu in dairy milk remains in place, as do rules that require cattle to be tested before they move across state lines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But it's unclear how much routine testing is actually being done in cattle — and some like Lakdawala speculate the reported decline in cases could be due to a lack of testing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The business model for dairy farms relies on moving cattle between farms, and new research from Lakdawala's team &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.31.666798v2" target="_blank"&gt;offers a sobering picture&lt;/a&gt; of why it's so hard to stamp out the virus on a farm.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;They found it's pervasive — in the air of the milking parlor, all over the equipment, even in waste streams that sometimes get used to clean the housing facilities for the cattle.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cows are "expelling it in their milk at such high levels," including animals that may have few or no symptoms, she says. "There is so much virus in the environment, these cows are bombarded with it. Of course, they're going to become infected."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As far as scientists can tell, the strain of H5N1 that's widely circulating has not seen the kind of mutations &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/07/24/nx-s1-5049893/u-s-bird-flu-outbreak-scientists-see-growing-risks" target="_blank"&gt;that would enable&lt;/a&gt; it to easily infect humans.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Lakdawala says the conditions on farms with infected cattle are clearly a risk for workers who are essentially breathing in H5N1 particles that are aerosolized and remain infectious.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Minnesota, which has seen about two dozen outbreaks on farms since mid-September, Karen Martin, an epidemiologist at that state's department of health, says they are monitoring about 35 people who were exposed in case they develop symptoms. The department is in contact with key people in the CDC's influenza division in case they need support.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What concerns me is continuing to have the resources to respond to it. We're holding it together right now," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A call for better testing of farm workers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Testing farm workers – the group at the highest risk of catching and spreading the virus – has been a problem since the beginning of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While some human cases have required hospitalization, most have been mild, often appearing as eye infections or other symptoms that are easily overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2840680" target="_blank"&gt;paper published&lt;/a&gt; last week, CDC scientists made a call for "robust data collection" of people with possible asymptomatic infections to better guide the public health response. One &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7344a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;small study&lt;/a&gt; from last year found evidence of a past bird flu infection in 7% of dairy workers in Michigan and Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;This kind of long-term research requires buy-in from farmers and their workers who are often undocumented. And that's unlikely to happen now because of fears about the Trump administration's immigration enforcement, says &lt;a href="https://www.ncfh.org/our-team/bethany-alcauter/" target="_blank"&gt;Bethany Boggess Alcaulter&lt;/a&gt; with the National Center for Farmworker Health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think it's definitely more intense than it was, and already there was a lot of reluctance to get tested," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When they were interviewing farm workers in California about bird flu this fall, she says many were too afraid to leave their homes. Their survey of several hundred workers in three states showed about 20% had symptoms at the same time animals on their farms were sick.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most of those people said they were never tested.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Nirav Shah, who helped lead the bird flu response under President Biden, says it made sense for the CDC to downgrade its emergency response to bird flu earlier this year, but that should not have changed the work done to monitor the virus and respond on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They are banking on the fact that there might not be anything, but that is a dangerous game to play when it comes to something like pandemic influenza," he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Inclusion criteria included being an English speaker; being at least 21 years of age; being in good general health; being able to provide blood samples before, during, and after the retreat; and agreeing to undergo fMRI neuroimaging before and after the retreat. Exclusion criteria included inability to consent, inability to follow or comply with study procedures, current use of psychoactive medications, contraindications for phlebotomy, and contraindications for MRI (pregnancy, history of seizures, electronic or ferromagnetic medical implants or devices, claustrophobia). Of 65 eligible participants, 36 were randomly selected to participate and provided written informed consent. Of 27 who consented, five were dropped due to scheduling conflicts; one participant was dropped for not complying with MRI facility masking requirements; and one participant failed MRI screening due to a heart stent. The study size was determined by the scanning time available at the fMRI facility (1 MRI scanner for 2 days pre- and post-intervention). Our study included male (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 6) and female (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 14) participants (gender identity), and similar findings are reported for both genders. Of the 6 male participants, 2 had been practicing the meditations carried out in the workshop daily for more than 1 year, 3 had been practicing the meditations daily for less than 1 year (one of whom practiced a different form of meditation), and 1 participant had not previously practiced the meditations before attending the retreat, though he had a different meditation practice. Of the 14 female participants, 8 had been practicing the retreat meditations for over 1 year (most being a daily practice), and 1 of the 8 also practiced a different form of meditation. Six of the 8 females had been practicing the meditations for less than 1 year, with only 3 reporting an almost daily practice, and 4 of the 8 reported having a different meditation practice. One of the 8 females had not previously practiced the meditations before attending the retreat, though she had a different meditation practice. The retreat began at 5 pm on Day 1 and ended at 1:30 pm on Day 7 and was conducted in April 2022 at the Manchester Grand Hyatt (San Diego, CA, USA). The diet was provided by the hotel. There were no adverse events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki principles and all relevant ethical regulations. Experimental protocols were approved by the Western Institutional Review Board (WIRB; now WCG-IRB; Protocol MED02#20211477) and registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 06615531). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to study inclusion, and clinical records are housed at VitaMed Research (Palm Desert, CA) as mandated by federal laws. All ethical regulations relevant to human research participants were followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec21"&gt;Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec22"&gt;Acquisition&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;fMRI was performed off-site at the UCSD Center for Functional MRI pre-intervention (Day 0: 8 am–8 pm and Day 1: 8 am–4 pm) and post-intervention (Days 8 and 9: 8 am–6 pm). Participants were positioned in the MRI scanner (Siemens Prisma 3T with standard 32-channel head coil) with a respiratory transducer placed around the chest, a pulse oximeter placed on the left index finger, and MRI-safe headphones. A structural scan, two functional blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) scans (resting state and meditation), and a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scan (not described here) were acquired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec23"&gt;Structural scan&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were instructed to “not move and keep eyes closed.” High resolution structural images were acquired with a T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequence with TR = 2400 ms, TE = 2.22 ms, TI = 1000 ms, flip angle = 8°, FOV = 224 mm, voxel size = 0.7 mm isotropic, 320 slices, slice thickness 0.80 mm, saggital orientation, bandwidth = 210 Hz/Px, and acquisition time = 7 min. 40 s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec24"&gt;Functional scans&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 5-min BOLD resting state scan, participants were instructed to “not move, keep eyes open, stay awake, and think about whatever you want, but do not meditate.” During the subsequent 15-min BOLD meditation scan, an auditory recording of a guided meditation from the retreat was played and participants were instructed to “not move, listen to the guided meditation soundtrack, and meditate as suggested by the audio while keeping your eyes open.” An eyes open paradigm was chosen to reduce the risk of drowsiness or sleep during the meditation run, which was deemed a potentially greater risk than the presence of visual confounds to accurately comparing active meditation with passive rest&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 66" title="Garrison, K. et al.

MEQ score differences were compared between sessions with Wilcoxon signed rank tests (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 18, two subjects missing data).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After confirming normality and heteroskedasticity, paired &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-tests compared RSNs, their component regions, a priori ROIs, and whole-cortex/brain networks pre- and post-intervention (separately for rest and meditation scans), plus rest and meditation (separately for pre- and post-scans) to investigate effects of time and of meditation, respectively. On rest vs. meditation comparisons, the last 5 min of the 15-min meditation scan were used to compare equal-length scans. &lt;i&gt;P-&lt;/i&gt;values were corrected for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni–Holm family-wise error correction and Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate when no results reached &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;FWE&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec31"&gt;Anatomical data&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preprocessed skull-stripped segmented T1w data was resampled to the MNI fsaverage template using mris_preproc (FreeSurfer 7.3.2) and cortical surface was inflated to an average spherical surface. Hemispheres were automatically parcellated into regions of interest, and vertex-wise volumetric and cortical thickness calculations were performed. Images were spatially smoothed with a 5 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. Pre-vs-post differences were assessed by repeated measures ANOVA, and group differences between novice and advanced participants at each timepoint were assessed by fitting a general linear model using mri_glmfit-sim.

Participants were offered the same food options for all breakfast, lunch, and snacks throughout the week, although food choices were not monitored. All participants were required to fast for at least 30 min prior to blood collection. Blood was collected in EDTA-coated tubes (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and kept at 4 °C (wet ice) for less than 30 min.

Plates were incubated for protein capture, unbound material was washed away, and biotinylated capture antibodies were added to hybridize with SOMAmer-bound proteins. Streptavidin-conjugated Cy3 dye was added to label the antibodies, plates were washed to remove unbound dye, and protein-bound SOMAmer reagents were eluted and hybridized to custom DNA microarrays containing complementary sequences to each SOMAmer. Cy3 fluorescence intensity in relative fluorescence units (RFU) measured protein abundance. Hybridization control normalization removed sample variance between microarrays and scanners; median signal normalization removed within-plate inter-sample differences; and calibration normalization removed variance across assay runs. Performance and quality were monitored with blank wells, technical replicates, and spiked protein controls, and precision was assessed by calculating coefficients of variation for all measurements. Background subtraction RFU calculations were performed with SomaLogic Discovery Server software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec37"&gt;Data processing&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;RFU values were normalized, log10-transformed, and auto-scaled (mean-centered and divided by each variable’s standard deviation), and outliers above two SDs were flagged. Foldchange and paired &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-tests tested pre/post-intervention differences, and hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering revealed correlated variation expression patterns.

There they found several dead elephant seals, including pups, which have not yet been tested for the flu. To date, Australia is the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov.au/topics/bird-flu" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;only continent that remains free&lt;/a&gt; from the highly contagious bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Researchers are now racing to assess how much worse the impact of these creatures could still get. Boulinier's team was the first to witness the impact of the bird flu in the Indian Ocean. Last season, wearing hazmat suits, they collected blood from live animals and brain tissue samples from the carcasses of several species. They hope to better understand how the virus is spreading and if the animals are developing any immunity against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;So far, blood sample analysis has been mostly negative for antibodies among elephant seals in this region, suggesting that a large portion of the population has not yet been exposed to the virus or developed immunity. "That raises concerns," says Boulinier, who is leaving for the islands to continue monitoring in a few weeks. "If there is another outbreak this year, it may also be devastating." Many of the seal species found in Antarctica and Sub-Antarctic regions are endemic and can only be found in these places, making mass die offs an even greater threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;&lt;span id="a-'cascade'-of-harm" class="sc-d16436d-0 gCPVhV"&gt;&lt;b id="a-'cascade'-of-harm" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;A 'cascade' of harm&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;What could this spread mean for the rest of life in the oceans? Elephant seals are top predators in the food chain, and a decline in their population can lead to cascading effects impacting the whole ecosystem, according to researchers, causing an increase in some fish species and a decrease in others, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Elephant seals are also especially important as an "ocean fertiliser", says Uhart.

&lt;p&gt;A Netherlands-based startup, Aqua Womb, is exploring the potential of making a womb-like life support system for extremely premature infants. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The objective is to advance the care of premature newborns through the development of a clinical-grade artificial womb, also known as a liquid-filled incubator. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Babies born between 22 and 24 weeks face huge risks. They currently have a low chance of survival and a high likelihood of developing health issues like chronic lung disease and neurological damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content t-space-y-4 t-text-gray-900 dark:t-text-[#F5F6F7] t-font-georgia t-font-normal t-text-[18px] md:t-text-[20px] t-leading-8 t-break-words"&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the US, thousands of infants are born each year within the &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(22)00147-8/fulltext#:~:text=A%20total%20of%2044%2C628%2C827%20infant,had%20higher%20survival%20than%20White" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"&gt;22-24 week window&lt;/a&gt;. Premature birth is the nation’s second-leading cause of infant death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One major reason why preterm infants are unable to sustain life is that their lungs are too immature to breathe air.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current mechanical ventilators can risk injuring fragile, underdeveloped lungs. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The artificial system is designed to provide a safe, continuous shelter environment, protecting the infant from early exposure to air.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It could allow the baby to float, grow, and mature without ever coming into contact with air.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-womb-outside-the-mother-s-body"&gt;A new womb outside the mother’s body&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this new device could allow premature babies to continue to grow immersed in an artificial womb environment until their lungs are mature enough to function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Guardian &lt;/em&gt;reported that the system utilizes a glass tank filled with synthetic amniotic fluid at near-body temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content t-space-y-4 t-text-gray-900 dark:t-text-[#F5F6F7] t-font-georgia t-font-normal t-text-[18px] md:t-text-[20px] t-leading-8 t-break-words"&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is designed with a firm outer silicone layer that pushes back against the baby’s kicks, thereby helping their muscles to stretch and gain strength.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/science/a-mouse-embryo-was-grown-in-an-artificial-womb-in-a-world-first" target="_blank" rel="dofollow"&gt;artificial womb&lt;/a&gt; would allow the baby to be delivered via C-section directly into a fluid-filled pouch and connected to a human-made placenta.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clinicians would then quickly connect the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/umbilical-cord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"&gt;umbilical cord&lt;/a&gt; to the external life support system or artificial placenta.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The artificial placenta, roughly the size of a human fist, serves as the central hub of life support, mimicking the exchange functions of a biological placenta.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is engineered with two types of specialized tubing: extremely fine catheters are used to gently extract carbon dioxide and metabolic waste from the infant’s bloodstream, while more robust cannulas simultaneously infuse the blood with the necessary oxygen and nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content t-space-y-4 t-text-gray-900 dark:t-text-[#F5F6F7] t-font-georgia t-font-normal t-text-[18px] md:t-text-[20px] t-leading-8 t-break-words"&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This complex, high-stakes reconnection ensures continuous circulation and sustainment, providing the premature infant the precious time needed for internal organs to mature without the damaging stress of air breathing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clinical-trials-approval"&gt;Clinical trials approval &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For parents who have suffered the devastation of extreme prematurity, the technology represents a long-awaited miracle to give &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/videos/the-miracle-and-science-of-life-from-conception-to-birth" target="_blank" rel="dofollow"&gt;infants&lt;/a&gt; more time in the womb.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If successful, the technology could save more vulnerable babies and spare them from chronic complications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One mother, who lost a 22-week-old child, said she would have “signed anything” to access the device.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the technology is not arriving anytime soon, and it comes with deep questions. U.S. health regulators are actively involved. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/05/baby-alive-outside-womb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is actively reviewing the data and considering whether to approve the first clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content t-space-y-4 t-text-gray-900 dark:t-text-[#F5F6F7] t-font-georgia t-font-normal t-text-[18px] md:t-text-[20px] t-leading-8 t-break-words"&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/science/artificial-womb-human-trials-fda-review" target="_blank" rel="dofollow"&gt;September 2023&lt;/a&gt;, the FDA convened an advisory committee to consider the trials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond the technical hurdles, experts warn that the artificial womb creates a new ethical frontier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This kind of device would create a new stage of human development, something we’ve never had to describe or regulate before,” Elizabeth Chloe Romanis, a medical law scholar at Durham University, told the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The technology is not ready yet, but the world waits for this potential miracle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aquawomb.eu/#:~:text=Stay%20Tuned,%C3%97" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"&gt;AquaWomb&lt;/a&gt; has not yet disclosed when the human trials are expected to begin.&lt;/p&gt;

The study, published Nov. 4 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;, found that blocking this specific site reduced inflammation and protected neurons. The results point toward a promising new strategy for treating neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm really excited about the translational potential of this work," said Dr. Anna Orr, the Nan and Stephen Swid Associate Professor of Frontotemporal Dementia Research in the Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute and member of the Appel Alzheimer's Disease Research Institute at Weill Cornell, who co-led the study. "We can now target specific mechanisms and go after the exact sites that are relevant for disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Mitochondria and Free Radicals Affect the Brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research focused on mitochondria, the cell's energy-producing structures that convert food into usable energy. In the process, mitochondria release reactive oxygen species (ROS) -- molecules commonly known as free radicals. At normal levels, ROS help regulate essential cell functions, but excessive or poorly timed production can damage cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Decades of research implicate mitochondrial ROS in neurodegenerative diseases," said Dr. Adam Orr, an assistant professor of research in neuroscience in the Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute at Weill Cornell, who co-led the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this connection, scientists have long tested antioxidants as a potential way to neutralize ROS and slow neurodegeneration. However, these clinical trials have largely failed. "That lack of success might be related to the inability of antioxidants to block ROS at their source and do so selectively without altering cell metabolism," Dr. Adam Orr explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A New Way to Stop Harmful Free Radicals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a postdoctoral researcher, Dr. Orr developed a drug discovery platform designed to find molecules that specifically suppress ROS at individual mitochondrial sites while leaving normal functions intact. Through this approach, the team identified a group of compounds called S3QELs ("sequels"), which showed potential to block harmful ROS activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on Complex III, a mitochondrial site known for producing ROS that can leak into the rest of the cell, potentially causing damage. To their surprise, the excess ROS did not originate from neurons, but from astrocytes -- non-neuronal cells that provide structural and metabolic support to neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When we added S3QELs, we found significant neuronal protection but only in the presence of astrocytes," said Daniel Barnett, a graduate student in the Orr lab and the study's lead author. "This suggested that ROS coming from Complex III caused at least some of the neuronal pathology."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further experiments showed that when astrocytes were exposed to disease-related factors such as inflammatory molecules or proteins linked to dementia (including amyloid-beta), their mitochondrial ROS production increased dramatically. Treatment with S3QELs suppressed much of this rise, while blocking other ROS sources did not have the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnett discovered that ROS oxidized certain immune and metabolic proteins involved in neurological disease, altering the activity of thousands of genes tied to inflammation and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The precision of these mechanisms had not been previously appreciated, especially not in brain cells," said Dr. Anna Orr. "This suggests a very nuanced process in which specific triggers induce ROS from specific mitochondrial sites to affect specific targets."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promising Results in Animal Models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the team administered the S3QEL compound to mice engineered to model frontotemporal dementia, they observed reduced astrocyte activation, lower levels of inflammatory gene expression, and a decrease in a tau modification linked to dementia. Remarkably, these effects appeared even when treatment began after symptoms had already started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extended treatment improved lifespan, was well tolerated, and produced no significant side effects. Dr. Anna Orr attributes this to the compound's highly targeted action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team plans to continue developing the S3QEL compounds in collaboration with medicinal chemist Dr. Subhash Sinha, professor of research in neuroscience in the Brain and Mind Research Institute and member of the Appel Alzheimer's Disease Research Institute at Weill Cornell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also intend to investigate how disease-associated genes influence ROS production and whether certain genetic variants that raise or lower dementia risk might do so by altering mitochondrial ROS activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changing How Scientists Think About Free Radicals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The study has really changed our thinking about free radicals and opened up many new avenues of investigation," said Dr. Adam Orr. The potential of these findings to open new research approaches to inflammation and neurodegeneration is highlighted in the journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Nottingham's School of Pharmacy and Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering created a bioinspired compound designed to restore enamel that has been eroded or demineralized. The same material can also reinforce existing enamel and help prevent future decay. Their findings were published on November 4 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mimicking Nature to Heal and Strengthen Teeth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This innovative gel can be quickly applied to teeth in much the same way as standard fluoride treatments. Unlike traditional products, it contains no fluoride. Instead, it is made from proteins that imitate those naturally responsible for guiding enamel formation early in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once applied, the gel forms a thin yet durable layer that seeps into the surface of the teeth, filling in tiny cracks and holes. It then acts as a scaffold that captures calcium and phosphate ions from saliva. These minerals are carefully organized into new enamel through a process known as epitaxial mineralization. This allows the regenerated enamel to integrate seamlessly with the existing tooth structure, restoring both strength and appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The material can also be used on exposed dentine, creating an enamel-like coating that helps reduce tooth sensitivity and improves how restorations, such as fillings or veneers, bond to the tooth surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enamel damage plays a major role in tooth decay, which affects nearly half of the global population. When enamel is lost, the teeth become more vulnerable to infections, cavities, and even tooth loss. These issues have also been linked to broader health conditions, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because enamel cannot naturally regenerate once it is lost, dental care has long focused on prevention or temporary protection. Existing treatments like fluoride varnishes and remineralization products can help relieve symptoms but do not actually rebuild enamel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restoring the Structure of Natural Enamel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Abshar Hasan, a Postdoctoral Fellow and lead author of the study, explained: "Dental enamel has a unique structure, which gives enamel its remarkable properties that protect our teeth throughout life against physical, chemical, and thermal insults. When our material is applied to demineralized or eroded enamel, or exposed dentine, the material promotes the growth of crystals in an integrated and organized manner, recovering the architecture of our natural healthy enamel. We have tested the mechanical properties of these regenerated tissues under conditions simulating 'real-life situations' such as tooth brushing, chewing, and exposure to acidic foods, and found that the regenerated enamel behaves just like healthy enamel."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Alvaro Mata, Chair in Biomedical Engineering &amp;amp; Biomaterials and lead investigator on the project, emphasized the technology's practical potential: "We are very excited because the technology has been designed with the clinician and patient in mind. It is safe, can be easily and rapidly applied, and it is scalable. Also, the technology is versatile, which opens the opportunity to be translated into multiple types of products to help patients of all ages suffering from a variety of dental problems associated with loss of enamel and exposed dentine. We have started this process with our start-up company Mintech-Bio and hope to have a first product out by next year; this innovation could soon be helping patients worldwide."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toward the Future of Self-Healing Teeth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With its ability to mimic natural enamel formation and strengthen teeth without fluoride, this new gel could redefine modern dentistry. If commercialized successfully, it may offer a simple, safe, and lasting solution for restoring enamel and preventing decay -- helping people maintain stronger, healthier teeth for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

That’s because resistance training, like lifting weights, creates muscle stress, which signals the body to produce more testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaeberlein stresses that following a healthy diet and lifting weights have plenty of health benefits, on top of boosting testosterone, so there’s absolutely no harm in trying them. “Regardless of whether you’re testosterone-deficient, you should be eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly anyway. But if boosting your testosterone is a motivating factor to get you to do it, that’s great!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a place to start with resistance training, we have an at-&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/strength-workouts/beginner-strength-training-routine-at-home" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/strength-workouts/beginner-strength-training-routine-at-home"&gt;home strength training routine for beginners&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/strength-workouts/beginner-gym-machine-workout-plan" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/strength-workouts/beginner-gym-machine-workout-plan"&gt;beginner gym machine workout plan&lt;/a&gt; to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;

The Cyclin A2 (CCNA2) gene, normally active during fetal development, enables heart cells to multiply but becomes dormant shortly after birth, leaving adult hearts unable to repair damage effectively. By reintroducing this gene into injured heart tissue, scientists observed the formation of new, healthy heart cells capable of normal contraction and improved functionality. This groundbreaking discovery offers a promising avenue for treating heart attacks and chronic heart failure, moving beyond conventional therapies that merely manage symptoms and prolong survival. If successfully translated into clinical practice, this discovery could completely transform cardiac care, allowing hearts to regenerate naturally, restore strength, and dramatically improve patient outcomes worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How the Cyclin A2 gene can help the human heart repair itself&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to this breakthrough lies in the Cyclin A2 (CCNA2) gene, which plays a crucial role in heart development. During fetal growth, CCNA2 is highly active, enabling heart cells to multiply and form a fully functioning organ. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, shortly after birth, the gene becomes dormant, and adult heart cells lose their ability to divide. This dormancy is one reason why the adult heart struggles to repair itself after injury, often leading to long-term damage or heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;What Your Cholesterol Report Is Hiding — The Truth That Could Save Your Heart | Dr Vinayak Agarwal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using a harmless viral vector to reintroduce CCNA2 into damaged heart tissue, scientists were able to reactivate this regenerative ability. Tests on donor heart cells aged 21, 41, and 55 showed the formation of new, healthy heart cells capable of normal contraction, demonstrating that even older hearts retain the potential to regenerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Human heart research reveals it can repair itself after injury&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery represents nearly 20 years of intensive &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41536-025-00438-7" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;research &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;in cardiac regenerative medicine. Dr Hina Chaudhry, the lead researcher and director of cardiovascular regenerative medicine at Mount Sinai, pioneered studies showing that similar methods could regenerate pig hearts following injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The successful application of this technique to human heart tissue marks a historic milestone. Dr Chaudhry explained, “Our findings challenge the long-standing belief that adult heart cells cannot regenerate. With the right intervention, the heart can repair itself, opening possibilities for treating heart attacks and heart failure without relying entirely on mechanical devices or transplants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Human heart disease and how CCNA2 gene therapy could change treatment&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide. In the UK, more than 100,000 people are admitted to hospitals annually due to heart attacks, and over one million people live with chronic heart failure. Current treatments focus primarily on symptom management and slowing disease progression, but they cannot restore lost heart tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for human trials, CCNA2 gene therapy could revolutionise treatment, potentially allowing damaged hearts to regenerate naturally and improve long-term survival rates. Gene therapy involving CCNA2 could eliminate the need for invasive procedures such as heart transplants or mechanical support devices for certain patients. By stimulating the heart to self-repair, the therapy targets the root cause of heart damage rather than simply managing symptoms. This approach could lead to faster recovery, reduced hospitalisation, and enhanced quality of life for millions of patients worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/want-to-live-longer-heart-surgeon-shares-5-daily-habits-that-protect-your-heart-and-extend-your-life/articleshow/125104607.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Want to live longer?

Between 2014 and 2019, India saw a nearly 50% increase in heart attack cases, highlighting the growing need for awareness and preventive care. Urbanisation, changing lifestyles, unhealthy diets, sedentary behaviour, and increasing prevalence of conditions like diabetes and obesity are key factors driving this surge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The burden of heart disease is not just a medical issue; it also affects economic productivity, healthcare infrastructure, and the overall quality of life for families impacted by these illnesses. Understanding the underlying causes, warning signs, and preventive measures is crucial for reducing the incidence of heart attacks in India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Chest pain is the only sign of heart attack - Myth of Fact?

This blockage deprives the heart tissue of oxygen, causing cells to die, which can lead to permanent heart damage or death if not treated promptly. Heart attacks are often preceded by silent risk factors that go unnoticed for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sudhir Kumar, a physician trained at CMC Vellore and practising at Apollo Hospitals, explains that almost 99% of heart attacks, strokes, and heart failures stem from pre-existing but undiagnosed risk factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often assume they are healthy because they feel fine, yet the early stages of cardiovascular disease can progress silently, making it extremely dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hidden health issues that increase the risk of a first heart attack&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most individuals who suffer their first heart attack already have one or more hidden health issues. The four most common silent risk factors include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elevated blood pressure (hypertension): High blood pressure damages the arteries over time, increasing the risk of plaque formation and heart attack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High cholesterol levels: Excess LDL cholesterol leads to fatty deposits in arteries, narrowing blood flow to the heart.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased blood sugar (diabetes or prediabetes): High glucose levels damage blood vessels and accelerate heart disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;History of smoking: Tobacco use damages the heart and blood vessels, contributing significantly to cardiovascular disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These risk factors may not cause noticeable symptoms until a major cardiac event occurs, which is why regular monitoring is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How lifestyle changes and medical care can lower heart attack risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that these risk factors are largely modifiable. Lifestyle changes, along with timely medical intervention, can significantly reduce the risk of a heart attack. Key strategies include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietary adjustments: A heart-healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats can help control cholesterol and blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular physical activity: Exercise strengthens the heart, improves circulation, and helps maintain a healthy weight and blood sugar levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quitting smoking: Avoiding tobacco drastically reduces the risk of heart disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stress management: Chronic stress contributes to hypertension and unhealthy habits that harm the heart.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Routine medical checkups: Regular monitoring of blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar allows for early intervention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Kumar emphasises that even small, consistent changes can significantly reduce the risk of a cardiac episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Importance of early detection and regular health checks for heart safety&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevention relies heavily on early detection of risk factors. Many strokes and heart attacks could be avoided if individuals monitored their health consistently. Routine health checks allow doctors to identify hidden issues and recommend interventions before they escalate. Dr Kumar warns that people often wait until severe symptoms appear, which is risky because heart attacks and strokes can occur suddenly and with serious consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitoring blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose levels is critical, especially for individuals over 30 or those with a family history of heart disease. Early intervention, whether through lifestyle changes or medication, can prevent the progression of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Recognising &lt;keyword id="24464359" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="heart-attack-warning-signs" source="keywords"&gt;heart attack warning signs&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to identify the early symptoms of a heart attack can save lives. According to Medanta, common warning signs include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persistent or recurring chest pain or pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pain radiating to the arms, neck, jaw, or back&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nausea, vomiting, or heartburn-like sensations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dizziness or fainting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excessive sweating and unusual fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anxiety or a feeling of impending doom&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediate medical attention is crucial when these symptoms appear, as early intervention improves survival rates and reduces long-term damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Preventive strategies for long-term heart health&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sustaining heart health requires consistent vigilance and proactive care.

A recent study found that long-term use of sleeping pills among older adults with insomnia was linked to poorer sleep quality—even worse than in those who had insomnia but didn’t take the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep Aids Cause Poor Quality of Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/48/10/zsaf168/8164643" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:new study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Sleep&lt;/em&gt; journal found that older adults who regularly used prescription sleep aids had less deep, restorative sleep, compared to those who don’t take the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://scnlab.com/team/thien-thanh-dang-vu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Thanh Dang-Vu;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Thanh Dang-Vu&lt;/a&gt;, the lead author of the study and director of the Sleep, Cognition &amp;amp; Neuroimaging Laboratory at Concordia University, told &lt;em&gt;Nifty 50+&lt;/em&gt; that chronic use of commonly prescribed sleeping pills “does not provide benefits in terms of sleep quality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that their use “is not only risky but also worsens sleep quality—in particular by affecting aspects of sleep that are important for brain health and memory consolidation.” Dang-Vu is also a neurologist and researcher at the Montreal Geriatric University Institute (IUGM) and vice president of research for the Canadian Sleep Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep sleep, also called slow-wave sleep, is when heart rate, breathing, and blood pressure drop and the body releases hormones that repair tissues and strengthen bones. It’s also the stage when the body and brain do most of their overnight repair work. During this stage of sleep, the brain consolidates memories, transferring them from short- to long-term storage by allowing the hippocampus (the brain’s memory hub) to communicate efficiently with the neocortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slow-wave sleep is especially sensitive to sleep loss. And when older adults get less of this deep, restorative sleep, it can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12168795/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:make memory and thinking problems worse;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;make memory and thinking problems worse&lt;/a&gt; as the connection between the hippocampus and neocortex weakens, making it harder for the brain to organize and hold onto new information. This, in turn, may accelerate age-related memory decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Concordia University in Canada followed 101 older adults divided into three groups: good sleepers, those with insomnia who didn’t use sleep aids, and those with insomnia who used them chronically (three or more times a week for over three months). Participants underwent overnight polysomnography, which records physiological functions during sleep, including brain waves, breathing, and heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Problem With Sleeping Aids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many older adults, a pill at bedtime can seem like the simplest fix, but long-term use comes with a cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benzodiazepines and similar medications are considered safe and effective for brief use (no longer than two to four weeks), such as for jet lag or temporary stress. They work by enhancing the effect of a brain chemical that slows brain activity and produces a calming, sleep-inducing effect. However, clinical guidelines recommend that older adults &lt;a href="https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.18372" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:avoid them entirely;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;avoid them entirely&lt;/a&gt; because of their potential risks like confusion, dizziness, fainting, falls, and hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older adults are especially vulnerable since their bodies process these drugs more slowly and their brains are &lt;a href="https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.18372" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:more sensitive to their effects;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;more sensitive to their effects&lt;/a&gt;, which makes &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02698811211069096" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:side effects stronger;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;side effects stronger&lt;/a&gt; and longer lasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These medications are also considered second-line treatments because they don’t address the underlying cause of poor sleep. And importantly, benzodiazepines aren’t meant for long-term use because they’re highly addictive. Over time, users may need higher doses to achieve the same effect, leading to dependence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stopping abruptly can cause withdrawal symptoms &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/31739/chapter-abstract/265577251" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:even at normal or low doses;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;even at normal or low doses&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1064748121001226" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Symptoms may include;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Symptoms may include&lt;/a&gt; anxiety, irritability, fatigue, weakness, and gastrointestinal problems, and in rare cases, seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risks are compounded in older adults, whose cognitive functions like memory and processing speed naturally decline with age. Research shows that benzodiazepines can further impair these abilities, amplifying the cognitive effects of aging. People who regularly use sleep medications are also about &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7925354/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:30% more likely;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;30% more likely&lt;/a&gt; to develop dementia than those who don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic use doesn’t just carry long-term risks—it may also undermine the very sleep it’s meant to help. Dang-Vu explained that chronic use of sleeping pills leads to shallow and less restorative sleep. “People using these pills may not feel refreshed when they wake up from their sleep, and may be less able to remember new information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older adults taking them may work with their doctors to gradually taper off the drug while beginning a cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) program, which has been shown to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01847-0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:improve sleep quality and reduce insomnia symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;improve sleep quality and reduce insomnia symptoms&lt;/a&gt; in older adults. Sleep struggles are common in later life, and it’s understandable to want quick relief. But it’s worth making sure the solutions you turn to are truly helping you, not just tonight, but in the long run. If you are not sleeping well, talk with your doctor about what may work to help you sleep better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;More from Nifty50+&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://nifty50plus.com/2025/11/05/new-study-finds-that-common-sleeping-aids-worsen-sleep-in-older-adults/health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:New study finds that common sleeping aids worsen sleep in older adults;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;New study finds that common sleeping aids worsen sleep in older adults&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://nifty50plus.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nifty50Plus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nifty50Plus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 02:54:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE5tODIxWDk5UTJwd2ZuMVY1cDZ1WnkyRVo2ZUZuaC1hUFF0dVNRX2IzckhXNDlfSk04YUoyRUU5RUdfbFdual92dnJ4UU1sSHc4anA4cXh6RjNZU0p0ek5zU2hmZ01nU2xXY2U5YngxR1BUYVRhOWc</guid></item><item><title>咖啡因如何帮助您管理头痛和其他三个提示- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr44j201rzo</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 idLnWK"&gt;How caffeine can help you manage headaches and three other tips&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-7bfdb3c2-0 fYJjWP"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-7bfdb3c2-11 ljQVMv"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="byline-new-contributors-contributor-0" class="sc-7bfdb3c2-5 fMReXM"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-7bfdb3c2-7 byKoUE"&gt;Yasmin Rufo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc-7bfdb3c2-9 bTXCSY"&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="byline-new-contributors-contributor-1" class="sc-7bfdb3c2-5 fMReXM"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-7bfdb3c2-7 byKoUE"&gt;Michelle Roberts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 eRlINq"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8c33/live/26185cc0-b8a9-11f0-9418-d155a3381a50.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8c33/live/26185cc0-b8a9-11f0-9418-d155a3381a50.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8c33/live/26185cc0-b8a9-11f0-9418-d155a3381a50.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8c33/live/26185cc0-b8a9-11f0-9418-d155a3381a50.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8c33/live/26185cc0-b8a9-11f0-9418-d155a3381a50.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8c33/live/26185cc0-b8a9-11f0-9418-d155a3381a50.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8c33/live/26185cc0-b8a9-11f0-9418-d155a3381a50.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8c33/live/26185cc0-b8a9-11f0-9418-d155a3381a50.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images A woman sits at a table, pressing her palms to her forehead.

So a study led by a team from the University of South Carolina restricted their investigation to individuals with cases of periodontal disease and dental caries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that people with both cavities and gum disease had almost twice the risk of stroke when compared to people with good oral health, even after controlling for cardiovascular risk factors," &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/home/PressRelease/5290"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Souvik Sen, the chair of the neurology department at the University of South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-popular-diet-seems-to-reduce-gum-disease-scientists-say"&gt;This Popular Diet Seems to Reduce Gum Disease, Scientists Say&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 5,986 adults with an average age of 63, with no prior &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/strokes-are-rising-among-under-55s-do-you-know-what-to-look-for"&gt;history of ischemic stroke&lt;/a&gt; (caused by clots), coronary heart disease, or cavities without a history of gum disease, whose health was tracked for an average of 21 years. Their oral health was then charted against major cardiovascular events, including &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org/en/about-stroke/types-of-stroke/ischemic-stroke-clots"&gt;ischemic stroke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_180261" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-180261" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/StrokeChart.jpg" alt="Stroke chart" class="wp-image-180261 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/StrokeChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/StrokeChart-600x392.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-180261" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Worse oral health was associated with a greater risk of stroke. (Wood et al., &lt;em&gt;Neurol. Open Access&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After dividing the participants into three groups based on good oral health, gum disease only, or gum disease &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/losing-your-teeth-could-be-a-deadly-warning-study-finds"&gt;and cavities&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers found just 4.1 percent of those with good oral health had experienced a stroke event in the past. Among those who just had gum disease, the figure jumped to 6.9 percent. In the gum disease and cavities group, the incidence was 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once common contributing factors such as body mass index and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/quitting-smoking-even-at-75-can-increase-life-expectancy-study-finds"&gt;smoking status&lt;/a&gt; were factored in, the final calculations showed that those with gum disease had a 44 percent increased risk of stroke than those with healthy mouths. Those with both gum disease and cavities had an 86 percent increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the study's results only describe an association, the researchers can only speculate why the link exists. However, studies suggest that inflammation and bacteria from the mouth can spread to other areas of the body, worsening &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-study-links-99-of-heart-attacks-and-strokes-with-four-risk-factors"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt; and increasing the likelihood of clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an idea that's been explored in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-own-mouth-bacteria-could-give-you-a-heart-attack-new-study-suggests"&gt;earlier studies&lt;/a&gt; too, which have found oral bacteria in the plaques that can build up and put pressure on the arteries – potentially leading to the formation of clots and triggering of ischemic strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings suggest that improving oral health may be an important part of stroke prevention efforts," &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/home/PressRelease/5290"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, people with both gum disease and cavities had a 36 percent higher risk of major cardiovascular events – including strokes, fatal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/doctor-realizes-hes-having-a-heart-attack-while-treating-heart-attack-patient"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, or fatal heart attacks – than those classed as having healthy mouths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also confirm the benefits of routine checkups: those who reported visiting the dentist regularly were 81 percent less likely to have both gum disease and cavities together, and 29 percent less likely to have gum disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study reinforces the idea that taking care of your teeth and gums isn't just about your smile," &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/home/PressRelease/5290"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sen. "It could help protect your brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People with signs of gum disease or cavities should seek treatment not just to preserve their teeth, but potentially to reduce stroke risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1212/WN9.0000000000000036"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurology Open Access&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But while the buzz fades overnight, the damage may not. Alcohol consumption leads to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/alcohol#tab=tab_1" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;2.6 million deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; each year globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). While the adverse effects of alcohol start from the first drop, excessive drinking can lead to a brain bleed. What’s more striking is that the ‘excessive’ limit is far lower than most people assume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study by investigators from Mass General Brigham suggests that excessive alcohol consumption may lead to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214348" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;more severe brain bleeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; and cause long-term brain damage at a younger age. The findings of the study were published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Neurology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Alcohol Consumption Linked to Increased Cancer Risk, Classified as Carcinogen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Excessive alcohol consumption linked to brain bleeds&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study found that alcohol consumption, especially in excess, may damage brain vessels—and the effect is long-term—due to severe brain bleeds. The research is based on patients treated for brain bleeds at Massachusetts General Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The brain bleed is one of the most lethal and disabling conditions known to human beings. They come on suddenly, cause severe damage, and often leave patients with life-changing disabilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s one of the most difficult conditions to recover from,” said corresponding author Edip Gurol, MD, a clinician investigator in the Mass General Brigham Department of Neurology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is a brain bleed?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brain bleed, also called an intracerebral haemorrhage or &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553103/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;haemorrhagic stroke,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; occurs when a blood vessel inside the brain bursts, according to the NIH. About 50% of people with this condition die, and 30% are severely disabled, the researchers noted. Gurol added that only 20% of people who sustain a brain bleed can take care of themselves independently a full year later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the effects of excessive alcohol consumption on brain bleeds, the researchers used a cohort of 1,600 patients admitted between 2003 and 2019 to Massachusetts General Hospital. These patients had a brain bleed that was not the result of an injury or trauma. Using CT scans, the researchers assessed the size and location of the brain bleed. MRI scans confirmed signs of damage to the brain’s small blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What they found&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The researchers found that about 7% of the brain bleed patients reported consuming three or more drinks a day. They discovered that people who drank heavily were younger when the brain bleed occurred (average age 64 versus 75) compared to those who didn’t. Their brain bleeds were 70% larger. These patients were also twice as likely to have a bleed deep inside the brain or one that spread into the brain’s fluid-filled spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed that even lower alcohol intake—two drinks per day—was linked to a younger age of onset of a brain bleed. The adverse effects of alcohol intake do not end there. Those who consumed alcohol in excess had lower platelet counts (cell fragments that help blood clot) and higher blood pressure when they arrived at the hospital. These patients also had damage to the tiny blood vessels in the brain, which is linked to dementia, memory loss, and walking problems. It is also a major risk factor for brain bleeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to prevent a brain bleed&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers proposed the hypothesis that heavy alcohol consumption raises blood pressure, damaging the small blood vessels in the brain, making them weak and more likely to leak or burst. When platelet counts are low, it becomes harder for the body to stop bleeding. Together, these factors can significantly increase the risk of a brain bleed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to prevent it? Drink less, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Minimising or stopping alcohol use is an important step to lower that risk. Even for people at relatively low risk of brain bleeding, limiting alcohol consumption to no more than three drinks per week may be an effective measure to protect against all types of stroke and to preserve both brain and cardiovascular health,” Gurol said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

One of those is Surrey where the local service, which has 11,000 adults on its waiting list,  is piloting a scheme to train a group of private GPs to carry out assessments and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;'I find daily life hard'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Louise has been waiting years for an assessment for ADHD &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Louise Nichols, who suspects she has ADHD, is just one of many people affected by the rationing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Even when she was at primary school she struggled. She was diagnosed with school phobia and ended up being home schooled for a while, and has since found it hard to stay in a job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The mother-of-one says it is frustrating to see everyone else managing, while she finds daily life hard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I need a way of helping me function to the best of my abilities.

It's not a trivial condition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;With the right support, she said people with ADHD can thrive,  but there were "high, high risks" that without that support, people's conditions can become much more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This, she said, can include mental health problems, substance misuse, unemployment and getting in trouble with the criminal justice system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And Dr Jessica Eccles, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said services were having to make difficult decisions because "rising demand was outstripping capacity" in many parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"There are unacceptably long waiting lists," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;'Diagnosis transformed my life'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Sam's life has been transformed by getting his ADHD diagnosis &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Patients who have received support say it has transformed their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Sam Stone is an example of that, but he had to battle to get help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The 33-year-old, who lives near Gloucester, paid for a private diagnosis on his health insurance, but his GP wouldn't accept it and he had to go back on an NHS waiting list to get it confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He is angry at how complicated the system is.

&lt;p&gt;In the end, his combination of rash, malaise, liver and kidney problems, facial paralysis, and swelling all fit with syphilis. However, syphilis that affects the liver is rare, occurring in less than 10 percent of cases, which made the diagnosis particularly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors think the infection was likely in the second stage. In the first stage, people just develop a chancre at the site of the infection. The chancre develops usually around a month after an exposure, is painless, and resolves on its own. Then the second stage emerges with the bacterial infection going systemic, usually with rash, malaise, loss of appetite, joint pain, swelling, fevers, and sore throat—similar to the man’s symptoms. After that, the infection can become latent (third stage) before reemerging in the tertiary (late stage), which can manifest in various ways, including with the destruction of the heart, central nervous system, and organs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While late-stage syphilis can show up years or even decades after an initial infection, the secondary stage doesn’t, the doctors note. “Secondary syphilis typically emerges within the first year after untreated primary infection and only rarely beyond 4 years,” they wrote in the report. It’s possible an immunosuppressing drug, like the steroid he took for his facial paralysis, could reactivate a latent infection, but once reactivated, it would be a late-stage infection, not a secondary one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the man’s STI history decades ago led the doctors to the right diagnosis, it doesn’t explain the current infection. A “more recent, unreported exposure must be considered,” the doctors wrote, but, ultimately, the timing and source of the infection remain unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a treatment of antibiotics, the man made a full recovery. His doctors note that local health authorities would be contacted to track down and notify the man’s actual sexual partners. How things went with the man’s wife also remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Women over 40 may benefit from creatine since they naturally store less as they age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creatine boosts brain energy to support better memory, focus and mental sharpness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It helps strengthen bones, build muscle and reduce inflammation as women age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-creatine-bad-for-you-11806099" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Creatine&lt;/a&gt; has become one of the most talked-about supplements, and many people are adding it to their daily routines. While most research has focused on men, emerging research suggests females—especially those over 40—could benefit from consuming it regularly, too.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Women tend to have lower creatine stores than men, which means they may experience even greater benefits from supplementing,” says &lt;a href="https://www.mariespano.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Marie Spano, M.S., RD, CSCS, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, women naturally store 70% to 80% less creatine in their bodies than men and tend to consume fewer dietary sources of creatine, such as red meat and seafood. As people age, creatine intake tends to decline even further, making supplementation a compelling option.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So what exactly is creatine, and how can it help support women over 40? Let’s dig into the science. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-is-creatine"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What Is Creatine? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Creatine is a compound found in every cell of the body. It’s naturally produced from amino acids and stored primarily in muscle tissue. Simply put, creatine provides your body energy. It helps your body replenish energy during periods of high demand, such as intense exercise, or when energy is limited, such as during mental fatigue or sleep-deprivation. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can get creatine from &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/proteins-to-eat-every-week-11684415" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; like meat and seafood, but it’s also available as a dietary supplement. Most supplements come in powdered form that can be mixed with liquids, though you can also find gummies, tablets and capsules. Because it’s difficult to get enough creatine from food alone to boost your body’s stores, supplements can help fill in the gap.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-can-support-better-memory"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Can Support Better Memory  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While you might not notice memory changes in your 40s, it never hurts to give your brain a little extra boost—and that’s where creatine can come in. “Studies suggest that creatine doesn’t just fuel muscles: it may also support sharper memory, better focus and faster thinking,” notes Spano. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://activeeatingadvice.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Leslie Bonci, M.P.H., RD, CSSD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;, agrees. “Creatine in the brain is increased with supplementation. That increase can improve cognitive function, especially memory,” she says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Studies have found taking creatine may improve memory in healthy people, with even greater benefits seen in older adults. These effects occur because creatine supports your brain’s energy systems, increasing levels of phosphocreatine and ATP—the main energy sources your brain cells use. Creatine also supports your mitochondria, your cell’s “powerhouses,” helping them produce more energy more efficiently. This extra energy helps your brain perform at its best. Interestingly, research shows taking more than 5 grams per day doesn’t appear to provide additional benefits, so smaller doses may be enough to support better memory.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-may-increase-bone-density"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; May Increase Bone Density &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Women are at greater risk of developing osteoporosis as they age, and bone density naturally begins to decline after age 40.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Creatine may play a role in supporting bone health by stimulating osteoblasts, the cells that are responsible for building bone. When these cells are more active, they release a protein called osteoprotegerin, which slows down osteoclasts, the cells that break down bone. The result? Less bone loss and stronger bones.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One study in postmenopausal women found that those who took 8 grams of creatine per day, combined with strength training, preserved more bone density in the hip than those who didn’t take creatine. These women also showed improvements in bone geometry, suggesting stronger bones.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-helps-promote-muscle-mass--strength"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Helps Promote Muscle Mass &amp;amp; Strength  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Women who lift weights may better preserve their strength by taking creatine. “Pairing creatine with resistance training can help women gain more muscle and strength compared to resistance training alone,” shares Spano. “This gives women an important edge for staying strong, independent and active as they age.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As we age, we naturally lose not only bone density but also lean muscle mass and strength, which can increase the risk of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sarcopenia-treatment-11746009" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sarcopenia&lt;/a&gt;, age-related muscle loss.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Combining creatine with resistance training can help counteract this process. “Creatine is most effective for women who do resistance training, but it can also result in greater muscle strength and power in women regardless of training,” adds Bonci.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research shows that starting with a short, few-day loading phase is most effective for boosting strength. After that, a daily dose of around 5 grams is enough to support both upper and lower body strength. Even taking creatine only on workout days (instead of daily) has been shown to lead to noticeable increases in muscle mass and strength.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Berries and fatty fish often get all the credit for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits (and for a good reason)—but creatine may deserve a spot on that list too. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chronic, low-grade &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; tends to increase with age and can negatively affect muscle, bone and overall health. Higher estrogen levels normally help keep inflammation in balance, but during menopause, estrogen drops. This hormonal shift affects not just bones but also inflammation and the immune system. Studies show menopause is linked to a decrease in the immune cells that fight infections, along with an increase in inflammatory markers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research has found creatine may help by acting like an antioxidant and reducing oxidative stress, which contributes to inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Creatine is one of the hottest supplements right now—and for good reason. For women over 40, it can support better memory, protect bone density, boost muscle mass when paired with resistance training, and help reduce inflammation. “Creatine is a metabolite with mighty benefits&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;for head-to-toe benefits and is an important consideration for a woman’s fuel kit,” says Bonci. &lt;br&gt;
