    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;We should all be checking our feet and toenails regularly as they play a 'huge role' in our overall health, a doctor said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Yellow discolouration (left) could indicate a toenail infection while dark nail stripes (right) could signal a type of skin cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead sciencetech-ccox"&gt;YELLOW DISCOLOURATION&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can indicate a toenail infection, Ms Bagga explained, and it can occur on any part of the nail. It causes the nail to discolour, become crumbly or thicken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another cause can be nail psoriasis, where the nail plate can become pitted with patches or lift up from the nail bed underneath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To help prevent toenail infections, it's good practice to keep your nails short, clean, and tidy, she advised. It's also important to wear a clean pair of socks every day and wear shoes that fit correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead sciencetech-ccox"&gt;DARK NAIL STRIPES&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is known as Melanonychia, which can appear as a brown or black band running lengthwise along the nail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most of the time it is simply a normal variation in the pigmentation of the nail. However, in some rare cases, it is a tell-tale sign of Subungual Melanoma, a type of skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'To help prevent Melanonychia, it's crucial to focus on good nail and foot hygiene,' Ms Bagga said. 'You also want to try and avoid any nail trauma - if you do injure your nail, allow it to fully heal properly and avoid picking at it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A mother-of-one is urging people not to ignore mysterious marks on nails after what she thought was a simple bruise turned out to be a deadly form of cancer . Laura Jennings, 40, from Leeds, first noticed a dark streak beneath her toenail in April 2022, but thought nothing of it. It turned out to be a deadly form of skin cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Swollen toes could indicate gout, which is more likely to occur in people who are overweight, while white spots on the nails can be caused by a deficiency of protein, zinc or iron&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead sciencetech-ccox"&gt;SWOLLEN TOES&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can be caused by a number of conditions including lymphatic issues, poor blood flow, or even gout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gout is a type of inflammatory arthritis characterised by sudden, severe joint pain, often in the big toe, caused by the buildup of uric acid crystals in the joints. It is more likely to occur in people who are overweight, and consuming a healthy diet that aids weight loss can help manage the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile there are less serious causes of toe swelling such as sitting or standing for long periods of time, wearing shoes that are too small, being overweight, dehydrated, or eating a diet that's heavy in salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Maintaining a healthy, balanced diet can help with some of these common issues, along with regular exercise and movement,' Ms Bagga advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead sciencetech-ccox"&gt;WHITE TOENAILS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;White lines or spots on the nail. also called 'leukonychia', are often caused by trauma such as stubbing your toe. However sometimes they can be a sign of deficiencies in protein, zinc, or iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although rare, fully white nails are slightly more concerning and could be an indicator of a systematic illness in another part of the body, Ms Bagga warned, including liver cirrhosis, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;If your toes feel unusually cold and lose their colour (left) it could be a sign they are not getting proper circulation. Meanwhile Athletes Foot is a common fungal infection that shows as itchy white patches between your toes (right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead sciencetech-ccox"&gt;BLUE DISCOLOURATION&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If your nails have a bluish hue and you notice that your toes feel unusually cold, it may be a sign that they are not getting proper circulation, Ms Bagga said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a common symptom of a condition called Raynaud's disease, which causes narrowing of the smaller arteries which supply blood to the extremities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Regular exercise can help improve blood circulation, which can be beneficial for managing the symptoms of Raynaud's, alongside helping you maintain a healthy weight,' she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead sciencetech-ccox"&gt;ITCHY TOES&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Athletes Foot is a common fungal infection that shows as itchy white patches between your toes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also affect the soles or sides of your feet, sometimes causing fluid-filled blisters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To help prevent Athlete's Foot, make sure to completely dry your feet after washing them, especially between your toes, Ms Bagga said, as well as wearing clean socks every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;If nails change shape or look curved and 'spoon'-like it could indicate an iron deficiency or aneamia, the doctor said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead sciencetech-ccox"&gt;ULCERS ON TOES OR FEET&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike a blister that occurs under the skin, an ulcer is a break in the skin's surface, appearing as an open wound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's very important that these are looked after to reduce any risks of infection, the doctor warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'During the time the wound is exposed, it can leave you vulnerable to developing an infection, which in serious cases can lead to amputation,' Ms Bagga said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead sciencetech-ccox"&gt;SPOON NAILS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Bagga advised that people inspect their toenails on a regular basis, as if they start to change shape and look curved or 'spoon'-like, it could indicate an iron deficiency or anaemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iron is essential for producing healthy red blood cells and maintaining proper nail health, so it's important to speak to a healthcare provider who may recommend taking a supplement, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;mol-permabox id="mol-67ac8900-4841-11f0-8dda-05c9819dbfad"&gt;&lt;div class=" mol-factbox sciencetech art-ins" data-version="2" id="mol-41d464b0-8dbb-11e9-aef0-fdb94fbba61e" data-permabox-url="/health/fb-7137041/WHAT-INGROWN-TOENAIL.html"&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An ingrown toenail is a 'common' problem that occurs when the nail grows into the toe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An affected digit may be red, painful or swollen. The nail may also curve into the toe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Signs of an infection include pus oozing out of the toe and feeling hot or shivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ingrown nails can usually be treated at home by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Soaking the foot in warm water three-to-four times a day for a few days to soften the skin and stop the nail growing into it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping the foot dry for the rest of the day&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wearing wide, comfortable shoes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Taking painkillers if necessary &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ingrown-toenail/"&gt;NHS &lt;/a&gt;advises we leave the nail to grow out rather than cutting or picking at it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the at-home treatment does not work, or the toe is painful or appears to be infected, see a GP. Patients should also seek the help of a doctor if they have a fever or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A foot specialist may then cut away part of the nail or remove it entirely. A local anaesthetic will first be applied to numb the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ingrown toenails can be prevented by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not cutting nails too short&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cutting straight across the nail rather than at the edges&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Not wearing shoes that are too tight or do not fit properly &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/mol-permabox&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 11:06:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxNUy1rTlVMeXQtU1J3Sk00ZU9wdjl5R2R4RXpMMFZCSGd2TUtRNmpHSkd2dzZsd3d6QUV3dmU5YzYzNFZ1c1JXMk1LQnc5OE9BaXRXMWt6R01zeWNQRjlIQ0FUSGYyRi1DNVIwb0hjeXBPYnJEbDIxeGRSQ213aUM5T21zMUh0dmtMMXhYSGtnS2lyZDJsZXFWZnpzVFdyeTNmSmZj</guid></item><item><title>火箭报告：欧洲可重复使用火箭的新延迟； SpaceX进驻SLC-37 - Ars Technica | Rocket Report: New delay for Europe’s reusable rocket; SpaceX moves in at SLC-37 - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxNazhqcER2VWpOQlkwTWpGS1VwVFZGN1hXMWY4YWNrQkNMVW82NjFTNVBLcDlTenp0WUpvR1VrVm9SQXlUUTVSU1JNS01CUkZEbzZjdFBlck9DT0NRMVhtTWtqbHVCUGo2TUpWZG9yRFpYM0Q0ZGNMdHdmNzB3Q1ZOYWptWlp2MWpkOG4yNlByU0d0aG9pOXJnQkkxTDAxWlIxN1JuUm1xM1ZqRXBNMEdqaEZTQjNyVHM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SpaceX tries something new with Falcon 9. &lt;/b&gt;With nearly 500 launches under its belt, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket isn't often up to new tricks. But the company tried something new following a launch June 7 with a radio broadcasting satellite for SiriusXM. The Falcon 9's upper stage placed the SXM-10 satellite into an elongated, high-altitude transfer orbit, as is typical for payloads destined to operate in geosynchronous orbit more than 22,000 miles (nearly 36,000 kilometers) over the equator. When a rocket releases a satellite in this type of high-energy orbit, the upper stage has usually burned almost all of its propellant, leaving little fuel left over to steer itself back into Earth's atmosphere for a destructive reentry. This means these upper stages often remain in space for decades, becoming a piece of space junk transiting across the orbits of many other satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now, a solution &lt;/em&gt;... SpaceX usually deorbits rockets after they deploy payloads like Starlink satellites into low-Earth orbit, but deorbiting a rocket from a much higher geosynchronous transfer orbit is a different matter. "Last week, SpaceX successfully completed a controlled deorbit of the SiriusXM-10 upper stage after GTO payload deployment," wrote Jon Edwards, SpaceX's vice president of Falcon and Dragon programs. "While we routinely do controlled deorbits for LEO stages (e.g., Starlink), deorbiting from GTO is extremely difficult due to the high energy needed to alter the orbit, making this a rare and remarkable first for us. This was only made possible due to the hard work and brilliance of the Falcon GNC (guidance, navigation, and control) team and exemplifies SpaceX's commitment to leading in both space exploration and public safety."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;New Glenn gets a tentative launch date. &lt;/b&gt;Five months have passed since Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket made its mostly successful debut in January. At one point the company targeted "late spring" for the second launch of the rocket. However, on Monday, Blue Origin's CEO, Dave Limp, acknowledged on social media that the rocket's next flight will now no longer take place until at least August 15, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/second-new-glenn-launch-slips-toward-fall-as-program-leadership-departs/"&gt;Ars reports&lt;/a&gt;. Although he did not say so, this may well be the only other New Glenn launch this year. The mission, with an undesignated payload, will be named "Never Tell Me the Odds," due to the attempt to land the booster. "One of our key mission objectives will be to land and recover the booster," &lt;a href="https://x.com/davill/status/1932113352714825833"&gt;Limp wrote&lt;/a&gt;. "This will take a little bit of luck and a lot of excellent execution. We’re on track to produce eight GS2s [second stages] this year, and the one we’ll fly on this second mission was hot-fired in April."&lt;/p&gt;

Study authors also published their findings in &lt;em&gt;Current Developments in Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s break down what they found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Was This Study Conducted?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers drew data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a 30-year study that started in 1985. It included 4,654 adults, almost 55% women, with an average age of 25 when the study began—also called the baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants’ diets were assessed at baseline and again at years 7 and 20. Specifically, researchers were looking for the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290373/a-buyers-guide-to-sugar-substitutes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cumulative average intake of artificial sweeteners;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;cumulative average intake of artificial sweeteners&lt;/a&gt;, diet beverages, aspartame and sucralose. Participants were placed into categories, called quintiles, based on their intake of these substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers were also looking for diabetes diagnoses over the 30 years of follow-up, of which there were 691 cases. They defined diabetes as a &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290761/best-time-to-check-blood-glucose-after-meal/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fasting glucose higher than 126 mg/dL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;fasting glucose higher than 126 mg/dL&lt;/a&gt;, glucose 200 mg/dL or higher after a glucose tolerance test, A1C higher than 6.5%, or the use of diabetes medications at follow-up visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Did This Study Show?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistical analyses were adjusted for certain demographics, including age, sex, race, education, energy intake, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol intake, diet quality and family history of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who consumed the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8043120/trader-joes-best-beverages-for-diabetes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:most diet beverages;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;most diet beverages&lt;/a&gt; had a 129% higher risk of diabetes compared to those who drank the least diet beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to those with lower intakes, those with the highest intake of saccharin, an artificial sweetener sometimes found in diet drinks, had a 110% increased risk of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Does This Apply to Real Life?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know it’s important to limit sugar, and beverages sweetened with sugar can be a major contributor of added sugar in our diets. But this study suggests that replacing regular sodas and other sweetened beverages with diet ones may not benefit you in the ways you’re hoping. It also suggests that they may even significantly raise your risk of developing diabetes—exactly the opposite of what you might think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientific community has gone back and forth on the safety of artificial sweeteners. And while the FDA lists artificial sweeteners as “generally recognized as safe,” we also know that research is mixed on sugar substitutes—particularly &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/are-artificial-sweeteners-bad-for-you-8431961" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:when it comes to your gut health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;when it comes to your gut health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study didn’t include sugar alcohols, a type of artificial sweetener, but &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/new-study-links-erythritol-with-higher-blood-clot-risk-8695390" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:other studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;other studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that they, too, may pose some risk, including for blood clots, which increase the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bad-foods-to-eat-for-lower-stroke-risk-11722148" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:risk of stroke and heart attack;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;risk of stroke and heart attack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study raises a lot of questions, which is a good thing with research. We still need more information to know if it’s only the artificial sweeteners raising the risk of diabetes, or if it's the combination of artificial sweeteners with other additives in the beverages. We also can’t know for sure if other additives in the drinks increase diabetes risk on their own, or if it’s a combination of the diet drinks and a poor diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite all these questions, here’s what we do know. Soda is far from being a whole food, but everything can fit in a varied and balanced eating pattern. Having a soda now and then is probably fine for most people. The key is how regularly you’re taking a soda break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you lean on your favorite fizzy pop to get you through a midafternoon slump, consider replacing it with an &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/energizing-nut-free-snack-recipes-8549709" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:energizing snack;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;energizing snack&lt;/a&gt;, like some nuts and cheese for a mix of &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/proteins-to-eat-every-week-11684415" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein and healthy fats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;protein and healthy fats&lt;/a&gt;. You could even take a quick walk or do some pushups against your desk to get your blood pumping. Changing your physiology is one of the quickest ways to change your energy state. And making sure you’re staying well-hydrated and well-fueled may help prevent the slump to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you like soda for the bubbles, consider replacing it with an unsweetened &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8052890/sparkling-water-soda-water-club-soda-seltzer-water-mineral-water-tonic-whats-the-difference/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sparkling water;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sparkling water&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll get all of the fizz without the additives that soda contains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study suggests that those who drink high amounts of diet sodas and other diet beverages may significantly increase their risk of diabetes. Soda, whether sweetened with sugar or artificial sweeteners, may be a delicious option now and then, but should probably not be a regular on anyone’s menu. If you’re a regular soda imbiber, begin replacing one soda a day with &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/this-gut-friendly-soda-is-my-go-to-drink-for-dry-january-8772967" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:natural beverages;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;natural beverages&lt;/a&gt;, including water, sparkling water or unsweetened tea. Milk and juice in moderation can work, too, and they provide essential nutrients. Over time, continue replacing your daily sodas one at a time until you get to a level you feel good with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/diet-soda-diabetes-study-11752952" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 10:33:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE1zaEg5Tk03NEx0U0tJSzlnWl9uaDVrMWxPRkxlNnlwTUpKdlg3Mmt4NElTNzFxY0JLZndxN2dORTJhZ3FrdjA1Tko5cENadlhnal9YWE4tc0RfUll0dTE0dy1fRzFFVHhmZHBsVjh6bUFvMVNo</guid></item><item><title>研究显示，您从未听说过的白葡萄酒的一个风险- MindBodyGreen | One Risk Of White Wine You’ve Never Heard Of, Research Reveals - MindBodyGreen</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxNT3Z5eGlPTnNMUF8xNUJHdGhFd0RZOEgzaGJidFV0UWJ5V3JDUW1EQzE5Q2VWcEN5b3FmQWFpa05aaXByYzJ5R2ExMHdmMVQwTm9YWkRVMzJjVEUyMXAxU2ZKY3g0d1JBUUkyN1paVS1Vdl9FQlpEdDE5X2FaelozYS16NXFnQ3B0Y0xzVG9YcThPNmwwY3NrOEh3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-11rlt5o-4 sc-z20p88-2 gGtfNP iaXQSz"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is from our longevity-focused newsletter, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;the long game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;, where we help you stay up to date on the latest research in the health space, with actionable, low-lift recommendations to put those learnings into practice.

The drug helped restore more normal sleep patterns and limited the buildup of tau, a protein known to damage neurons. The findings raise the possibility that medications targeting the brain’s sleep-wake system could one day help prevent or slow the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is marked by memory loss, cognitive decline, and shrinking of brain tissue over time. One of its key features is the buildup of tau, a protein that normally helps stabilize the internal structure of brain cells. In Alzheimer’s, tau becomes chemically altered in a way that causes it to clump together and form tangles inside neurons. These tangles disrupt communication between brain cells and contribute to their eventual death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although sleep disturbances are common in Alzheimer’s, researchers are increasingly viewing poor sleep not just as a symptom of the disease, but as a possible contributing factor to its progression. A growing body of research has linked reduced time spent in restorative non-REM and REM sleep to a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative conditions. One of the mechanisms thought to underlie this relationship involves a system in the brain that helps regulate wakefulness, known as orexin signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orexin is a neuropeptide produced in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. It plays a central role in keeping us awake and alert by stimulating activity in wake-promoting areas of the brain. In healthy individuals, orexin levels rise during the day to promote alertness and fall at night to allow sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in people with sleep disturbances—and in animal models of Alzheimer’s—orexin signaling can become overactive, contributing to fragmented sleep and increased time spent awake. Notably, orexin-producing neurons are among the earliest to show damage in Alzheimer’s and related tau disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Investigating the role of orexin signaling as a potential therapeutic treatment for pathological tau was the next step in a broader line of investigation the lab has been following for a while. We have known that sleep loss is a risk for Alzheimer’s for a long time,” explained study author &lt;a href="https://sleepresearch.wustl.edu/people/samira-parhizkar-phd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Samira Parhizkar&lt;/a&gt;, an instructor of neurology at Washington University in St. Louis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previously, we had looked into how knocking out orexin receptors affects amyloid pathology, one of the key hallmark proteins in Alzheimer’s disease, in mice. From that, we already knew orexin signaling was tied into sleep regulation and disease processes. But since tau pathology, another key characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease —rather than amyloid—is more tightly linked with actual brain atrophy and cognitive decline, we wanted to shift focus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s where lemborexant came in,” Parhizkar explained. “It’s a clinically approved drug for treating insomnia that blocks orexin receptors – peptides in the brain that keep us awake and alert. We figured if it could normalize sleep, and hit that same orexin pathway, maybe it could also prevent some of the tau-related damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this, the researchers used a genetically engineered mouse model that mimics key features of Alzheimer’s disease. These mice, called P301S/E4 mice, carry both a human tau mutation and the human APOE4 gene, which is the strongest known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s. These mice begin to show significant tau buildup, brain inflammation, and brain shrinkage by about 9.5 months of age. Importantly, they also show disrupted sleep-wake cycles, making them a useful model for studying the connection between sleep and neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We investigated the effects of lemborexant, which is partially selective for orexin receptor 2 and primarily influences sleep/wake regulation, in the P301S/E4 mouse model of tau-mediated neurodegeneration,” Parhizkar said. “This model exhibits both sleep disturbances and brain atrophy with accumulating tau pathology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared lemborexant’s effects to those of zolpidem, a commonly prescribed sleep aid that works through a different mechanism. Starting at 7.5 months of age, the mice were treated daily with one of the drugs or a control solution. Sleep was measured using both EEG recordings and motion sensors, and brain tissues were analyzed after two months of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lemborexant increased the amount of non-REM sleep in male mice, especially when administered in the early evening (ZT13). This increase in deep sleep was associated with reduced levels of phosphorylated tau in the brain, especially in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex—regions essential for memory. Immunohistochemistry revealed that mice treated with lemborexant had fewer tau tangles, and biochemical analyses showed a reduction in tau proteins phosphorylated at sites associated with disease progression. Zolpidem, while also promoting sleep, did not significantly reduce tau levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to its effects on tau, lemborexant appeared to protect the brain’s structure and function. Treated mice showed less shrinkage in key brain regions and thicker layers of neurons in the dentate gyrus and piriform cortex. They also had lower levels of neurofilament light chain in the blood, a marker of neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, lemborexant-treated mice retained more synaptic structures, as shown by markers of presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins. These mice also showed reduced microglial activation, suggesting less brain inflammation. The drug appeared to shift microglia—the brain’s immune cells—away from a reactive, potentially damaging state and toward a more homeostatic role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We initially hypothesized that enhancing non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, which is closely linked to deep sleep, could help mitigate the damage caused by abnormal tau in the brain,” Parhizkar told PsyPost. “What was surprising was that these effects were not seen with a standard sleep drug like zolpidem that increases NREM sleep similarly to lemborexant. This suggests that the benefit is not just about more sleep, but rather how that sleep is promoted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how lemborexant might be reducing tau pathology, the researchers looked at downstream molecular pathways. They found that lemborexant reduced levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and the activity of protein kinase A (PKA), a key enzyme known to phosphorylate tau. This suggests that blocking orexin signaling can suppress a molecular cascade that leads to abnormal tau modification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also tested this idea in a second experiment, using mice genetically engineered to lack orexin receptor 2. When these mice were injected with pathological tau extracted from human Alzheimer’s brains, they showed significantly less tau seeding and spreading compared to normal mice. This effect was similar to that seen in mice treated with lemborexant, reinforcing the idea that orexin receptor 2 plays a key role in tau pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Another surprising finding was that protein kinase A, an enzyme recognized for decades for its role in promoting formation of abnormal tau found in disease states, could be affected by changes in the orexin signaling pathway,” Parhizkar said. “By showing both pharmacologic (lemborexant) and genetic (orexin receptor 2 knockout) approaches having similar effects, the study makes a strong case that orexin signaling may be a modifiable driver of tau pathology, not just a bystander.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the protective effects of lemborexant were mostly seen in male mice. Female mice did not show the same reductions in tau buildup or brain atrophy, despite experiencing similar improvements in sleep. This sex difference is consistent with other studies showing that male and female animals can respond differently to both Alzheimer’s pathology and pharmacological interventions. The reason for this difference remains unclear but may involve hormonal influences or differences in baseline tau accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although lemborexant showed strong protective effects at the molecular and structural levels, its impact on behavior was limited. The only behavioral improvement observed was a modest enhancement in a spontaneous alternation task, which measures exploratory behavior. The lack of improvement in more memory-focused tasks, such as fear conditioning, may be due to the fact that lemborexant’s protective effects were stronger in the entorhinal cortex than in the hippocampus, which is more directly involved in those tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study is the first of its kind to demonstrate that a sleep aid can prevent atrophy in the brain typically observed with build-up of abnormal tau, suggesting that targeting sleep through dual orexin receptor antagonism may have broader therapeutic potential beyond symptom management with potential protective effects on the brain,” Parhizkar told PsyPost. “This opens the door to repurposing orexin antagonists—already approved for insomnia—as a potential disease-modifying therapy in Alzheimer’s and additional tau-related neurodegenerative diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the promising results, there are some limitations to consider. The study was conducted in mice, so it is unclear whether the findings will generalize to humans. The treatment began before significant tau pathology had developed, meaning the drug’s effects on established disease remain unknown. The researchers also did not test other orexin receptor antagonists or explore the long-term effects of treatment beyond two months. Moreover, the reason why only male mice benefited remains to be explored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Significant questions remain before lemborexant could be recommended for preventing Alzheimer’s disease in humans,” Parhizkar noted. “For example, we need more evidence to determine whether long-term use is effective in preventing cognitive decline and which individuals may benefit from it. Although these findings are encouraging, it is still early days. We now have evidence that dual orexin antagonists can influence levels of both amyloid and tau, which could potentially delay the progression of Alzheimer’s disease if treatment begins before or during the early stages of mild cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our team is planning additional studies to better understand the mechanisms behind lemborexant’s protective effects and to explore whether combining different therapeutic approaches might be more effective than current options, either alone or in combination with other available treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-01966-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Lemborexant ameliorates tau-mediated sleep loss and neurodegeneration in males in a mouse model of tauopathy&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Samira Parhizkar, Xin Bao, Wei Chen, Nicholas Rensing, Yun Chen, Michal Kipnis, Sihui Song, Grace Gent, Eric Tycksen, Melissa Manis, Choonghee Lee, Javier Remolina Serrano, Megan E.

These so-called poop transplants have understandably received a lot of attention, but new research casts a bit of a wet blanket over the practice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The procedure involves taking microbes from the poop of a healthy person and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/need-a-fecal-transplant-theres-a-poop-bank-for-that-1521772837"&gt;&lt;span&gt;transferring them into a patient’s colon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This should restore balance to their gut microbiome, but according to a study published June 6 in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00564-1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, transplanted microbes may colonize the wrong parts of the digestive system. This can result in long-lasting &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/fecal-transplant-patient-killed-by-superbug-traced-to-d-1835521476"&gt;&lt;span&gt;unintended health consequences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the researchers warn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class="pullquote text-center"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think it’s a bit of a wakeup call to the field that maybe we shouldn’t willy-nilly put large bowel microbes into different parts of the intestine that shouldn’t be there.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think it’s a bit of a wakeup call to the field that maybe we shouldn’t willy-nilly put large bowel microbes into different parts of the intestine that shouldn’t be there,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/fecal-transplants-can-have-unintended-side-effects-study-finds"&gt;&lt;span&gt;said&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; lead author Orlando “Landon” DeLeon, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Chicago, in a statement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;DeLeon led a team of researchers through a series of experiments on mice to determine how fecal matter transplants affect different parts of the intestine. The mice were separated into three groups. One received microbes from the jejunum (the middle part of the small intestine), the second received microbes from the cecum (a pouch that connects the small intestine to the colon), and the third received a standard fecal transplant from the colon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Each part of the digestive system contains uniquely adapted microbiota. The researchers wanted to see if the microbes would stick to their respective niches once inside the mice. In fact, they found that each of the transplants successfully colonized the full intestinal tract, creating regional gut “mismatches” that lasted for up to three months after the procedure. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Microbes that colonized parts of the gut where they didn’t belong triggered metabolic changes in these intestinal regions, with the potential to affect a patient’s health and behavior. The researchers observed changes in the mice’s eating habits, activity, and energy expenditure following the transplants. They also documented changes in gene activity associated with immune function, which in turn led to changes in liver metabolism. Most surprising was the manner in which these foreign microbes altered gene and protein expression in the intestinal lining to make the mismatched gut region more suitable for them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s like they’re engineering or terraforming their environments to help them fit in,” DeLeon said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To determine whether these mismatches could occur in actual fecal transplant patients, he and his colleagues conducted additional tests using human tissue samples. Results showed that transplanted gut bacteria can colonize parts of the human digestive system where they don’t naturally belong.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If we’re designing good therapeutics, we should be aware of the importance of matching the regional microbiota to their proper environments, so that we provide better overall health benefits,” DeLeon said. For example, the findings suggest it may be safer to use microbes retrieved from all the parts of the digestive system, according to the researchers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/25202-fecal-transplant"&gt;&lt;span&gt;recommends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; fecal transplants for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-taboo-treatment-how-fecal-transplants-save-lives-5893234"&gt;&lt;span&gt;treating repeated infections of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Clostridium difficile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, or C. diff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This bacterium—which can cause severe gastrointestinal symptoms—most commonly sickens hospital patients who have been treated with antibiotics. Fecal transplants have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/medical-advances/science-and-research/how-do-fecal-transplants-work"&gt;&lt;span&gt;proven&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to be highly effective for treating these infections, and those results have encouraged researchers to investigate other applications for this procedure. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A wave of new research suggests that fecal transplants could treat conditions that go beyond the gut. Indeed, studies have found that this procedure could benefit patients with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10017995/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;neurodevelopmental&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7294648/#:~:text=All%20studies%20found%20a%20decrease,the%20transplantation%20of%20healthy%20microbiota."&gt;&lt;span&gt;psychiatric disorders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10745313/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, type 2 diabetes, and more. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;DeLeon’s findings suggest that doctors need to better understand the risks of fecal matter transplants before this treatment can be used for diseases other than C. diff. He plans to keep investigating how different microbes affect each part of the intestine and explore ways to restore altered regions to their original state. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This study shows that when it comes to gut microbes, location really matters.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A document the Department of Health and Human Services sent to lawmakers to support Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s decision to change U.S. policy on COVID vaccines cites scientific studies that are unpublished or under dispute and mischaracterizes others.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One health expert called the document "willful medical disinformation" about the safety of COVID vaccines for children and pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It is so far out of left field that I find it insulting to our members of Congress that they would actually give them something like this. Congress members are relying on these agencies to provide them with valid information, and it's just not there," said Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/mark-turrentine-32066" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Turrentine&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Baylor College of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy, who was an anti-vaccine activist before taking a role in the administration, announced May 27 that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/27/nx-s1-5413179/covid-vaccine-children-pregnant-rfk-cdc" target="_blank"&gt;no longer recommend COVID vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for pregnant women or healthy children, bypassing the agency's formal process for adjusting its vaccine schedules for adults and kids. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The announcement, &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" target="_blank"&gt;made on the social media platform X&lt;/a&gt;, has been met with outrage by many pediatricians and scientists.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The HHS document meant to support Kennedy's decision, obtained by KFF Health News, was sent to members of Congress, according to Democratic staff on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the office of Rep. Kim Schrier, D-Wash.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Titled "Covid Recommendation FAQ", the document has not been posted on the HHS website, though it is the first detailed explanation of Kennedy's announcement from the agency.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p id="resnx-s1-5431935-101" class="bucketwrap statichtml"&gt;
            
   &lt;/p&gt;
   

   &lt;p&gt;Medical experts who reviewed all the citations in the FAQ said it distorts some legitimate studies and cites others that are disputed and unpublished.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;HHS director of communications Andrew Nixon told KFF Health News: "There is no distortion of the studies in this document. The underlying data speaks for itself, and it raises legitimate safety concerns. HHS will not ignore that evidence or downplay it. We will follow the data and the science."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;HHS did not respond to a request to name the author of the document.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20420986241226566" target="_blank"&gt;One of the studies&lt;/a&gt; the HHS document cites is under investigation by its publisher, Sage Journals, regarding "potential issues with the research methodology and conclusions and author conflicts of interest," according to a link on &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20420986241239903" target="_blank"&gt;the study's webpage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"This is RFK Jr.'s playbook," said Dr. &lt;a href="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/accords/about/faculty-staff-directory/O-Leary-Sean-UCD11631" target="_blank"&gt;Sean O'Leary&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics and an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. "Either cherry-pick from good science or take junk science to support his premise — this has been his playbook for 20 years."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Outdated and misinterpreted research about myocarditis and pericarditis&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.20.24306810v1" target="_blank"&gt;study cited&lt;/a&gt; in the document is a preprint that was made available online a year ago, and has still not been published in a peer-reviewed journal. Under the study's title is an alert that "it reports new medical research that has yet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-72530" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The FAQ draws on the preprint to claim that "post-marketing studies" of COVID vaccines have identified "serious adverse effects, such as an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis" — conditions in which the heart's muscle or its covering, the pericardium, suffer inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;While research early in the pandemic did find that, new research not included in the memo indicates that the risk has fallen with new vaccine protocols.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And the HHS document omitted numerous other &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39404761/" target="_blank"&gt;peer-reviewed&lt;/a&gt; studies that have shown that the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39826014/" target="_blank"&gt;risk of myocarditis&lt;/a&gt; and pericarditis is greater after contracting COVID for both vaccinated and non-vaccinated people than the risk of the same complications after vaccination alone.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One the 2024 preprint coauthors &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2024/08/08/myocarditis-vaccinated-covid-19-oxford-fact-check/74639942007/?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank"&gt;refuted the idea&lt;/a&gt; that their research found myocarditis and pericarditis were caused by the COVID shots, rather than COVID infection, noting that the study did not compare outcomes between people who were vaccinated and those infected with the COVID virus.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study also focused only on children and adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;O'Leary said that while some cases of myocarditis were reported in vaccinated adolescent boys and young men early in the COVID pandemic, the rates declined after the two initial doses of COVID vaccines were spaced further apart.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, adolescents and adults who have not been previously vaccinated receive only one shot, and myocarditis no longer shows up in the data, O'Leary said, referring to the CDC's &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety-systems/vsd/index.html#cdc_generic_section_5-access-and-use-vsd-data" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccine Safety Datalink&lt;/a&gt;. "There is no increased risk at this point that we can identify," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Congress relies on health agencies for accurate guidance&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In two instances, the HHS memo makes claims about dangers to pregnant women that are &lt;a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.17721" target="_blank"&gt;actively refuted&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/fulltext/2022/04000/in_vitro_fertilization_and_early_pregnancy.3.aspx%C2%A0" target="_blank"&gt;the papers&lt;/a&gt; it cites to back them up. Both papers support the safety and effectiveness of COVID vaccines for pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The HHS document says that another &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X24001270?via%3Dihub#s0090" target="_blank"&gt;paper it cites&lt;/a&gt; found "an increase in placental blood clotting in pregnant mothers who took the vaccine." But the paper doesn't contain any reference to placental blood clots or to pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I've now read it three times. And I cannot find that anywhere," said Turrentine, the OB-GYN professor.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;If he were grading the HHS document, "I would give this an 'F,'" Turrentine said. "This is not supported by anything and it's not using medical evidence."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While members of Congress who are physicians should know to check references in the paper, they may not take the time to do so, said Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/neil-silverman" target="_blank"&gt;Neil Silverman,&lt;/a&gt; a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology who directs the Infectious Diseases in Pregnancy Program at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They're going to assume this is coming from a scientific agency. So they are being hoodwinked along with everyone else who has had access to this document," Silverman said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The offices of three Republicans in Congress who are medical doctors serving on House and Senate committees focused on health, including Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., did not respond to requests for comment about whether they received the memo. Emily Druckman, communications director for Rep. Kim Schrier, D-Wash., a physician serving on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, confirmed that Rep. Schrier's office did receive a copy of the document.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The problem is a lot of legislators and even their staffers, they don't have the expertise to be able to pick those references apart," O'Leary said."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;C.J. Young, deputy communications director for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, confirmed that Democratic staff members of the committee received the document from HHS. In the past, he said, similar documents would help clarify the justification and scope of an administration's policy change and could be assumed to be scientifically accurate, Young said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This feels like it's breaking new ground. I don't think that we saw this level of sloppiness or inattention to detail or lack of consideration for scientific merit under the first Trump administration," Young said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/about-us/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                Pastor Billiance Chondwe has known 9-year-old Diana Lungu since she was born. He helped her mother through a rough pregnancy and during Diana's early years. Diana's mother died of AIDS when Diana was nearing her third birthday.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Night had fallen hours ago, but Billiance Chondwe was not slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On Feb. 20, he frantically tapped out texts on WhatsApp, dialed distant acquaintances and left voice messages from his home in Zambia. He'd pause only to close his eyes and think of whom else he could reach out to for help.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He urgently needed to find medication for Diana Lungu. She's an orphan, she's 9 — and she's HIV-positive. She'd run out of the daily pills she takes to suppress the virus. Without the pills, the virus would surge back.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I called the whole night … calling everyone," remembers Chondwe, 53, a reverend known in his community simply as Pastor Billy. "I slept around 3 a.m."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;One of his messages found its way to Thailand, where Susan Hillis was standing in an airport check-in line. It was the wee hours of the morning there, and she was heading home to the U.S. from a conference of Christian mission hospitals. As she listened to the message, Hillis could sense the exhaustion and fear in Pastor Billy's voice — and she knew how much Diana means to him.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I was about four people from checking in, and I had tears in my eyes and was choked up," recalls Hillis, an epidemiologist who has spent years on HIV/AIDS work. "I was thinking: 'She's going to die. She is going to die.'"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was through her work in the faith community that she first connected with Pastor Billy — and learned about Diana, a girl with short cropped hair and a cautious but bright smile.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over the years, Pastor Billy and his wife, Catherine Nanyangwe Chondwe, have taken more than 15 orphans into their home — raising them for periods of time alongside their own five children. "Some were sleeping in the kitchen, others in the sitting room," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71246" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Diana lost her mother to HIV and her grandmother to COVID-19. She never knew her father. Pastor Billy says whatever stability she has had in her life is in large part thanks to the U.S. government.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Diana stayed with them on and off for four years. There was something different about her, they say&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— a generosity that took them both by surprise. "Maybe there is tea, or there is porridge, but any child nearby — [Diana] would share with them," Pastor Billy says. The same thing happened when they gave her toys.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;An AIDS orphan who is HIV-positive herself, Diana has lost her mother to HIV and her grandmother to COVID-19. She never knew her father. Pastor Billy says whatever stability she has had in her life is in large part thanks to the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Diana's HIV medications and her medical care have been provided by a U.S.-funded clinic with a big salmon-colored gate in her town of Kapiri Mposhi. And a U.S. program supporting AIDS orphans provided Diana with monthly food packages — often fish, beans and cornmeal. Proper nutrition is critical when taking HIV drugs. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;PEPFAR — the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief — paid for all of it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then came inauguration night.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Half a world away, in Washington, D.C., President Trump signed an executive order with a Sharpie, freezing almost all foreign aid. A flurry of stop-work orders followed, as did program terminations for billions of dollars of international health programs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;From one day to the next, Diana's HIV clinic went from providing lifesaving medications to closing its doors. There was no warning and no time to get her medical file and transfer it to another clinic. The monthly package of food also stopped without warning.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By that time, Pastor Billy's church had transferred him to a different town. He'd found someone in Diana's community — Jennifer Mukuka — to welcome her in.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71247" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"I don't have much, but I just have this big heart," says Mukuka. She has been able to bear the cost of raising Diana because of the aid from PEPFAR, which also covered fees for her school books and uniform.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And that kind of security has given Diana space to dream of her own future. On her 20-minute walk to school — down dusty, craggy roads — she often imagines becoming a doctor, with a white coat and stethoscope, moving from one bedside to the next.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;On that February night — when Pastor Billy reached out to Hillis and almost a dozen others — he had just learned that Diana had run out of her daily HIV medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hillis remembers thinking to herself in that airport line: "If it's happening to her, it's happening to a lot of people."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71518" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;"Successful" and "unsung"&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Diana was one of 6.6 million orphans and vulnerable children supported last year by PEPFAR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;PEPFAR spokespeople often point out that the program has saved more than 26 million lives since its launch in 2003. And it has also helped children on a massive scale. Starting in 2006 — just a few years after then-President George W. Bush created the initiative — a bipartisan team of Democrats and Republicans made sure that 10% of the funding each year was set aside for AIDS orphans and vulnerable children. Last fiscal year, PEPFAR spent just over $200 million on these youngsters — about $31 per child supported.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;AIDS often kills people in their childbearing years and has left &lt;a href="https://data.unicef.org/topic/hivaids/global-regional-trends/" target="_blank"&gt;millions of orphaned children&lt;/a&gt; in its wake. PEPFAR's vision was to enable local families to take in these orphans by providing basics — not only medicine but also food, clothing and school fees, as well as psychosocial support to address stigma. The program defined orphans as children who had lost one or both parents to AIDS, and the children did not necessarily have HIV themselves. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71250" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                The U.S. government's PEPFAR program provided AIDS orphans with food, clothing, school fees — and medicine if they were HIV-positive, like Diana. Now, without aid, Diana and the family she lives with are scrambling to provide these necessities. Here, Diana eats breakfast before heading to school.

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cfar.ucsf.edu/people/eric-goosby" target="_blank"&gt;Eric Goosby&lt;/a&gt; — the infectious disease physician who oversaw PEPFAR from 2009 to 2013&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— says it's hard to overstate the impact of this program that is at once "very successful" and "largely unsung."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The orphan-and-vulnerable-children response that PEPFAR created was bigger than the Catholic Church, all added up in every country, in terms of the number of orphans saved," says Goosby, now a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. "That was the largest effort on the planet."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now it's mostly on hold.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In an emailed statement, spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said that while HIV treatment and care are allowed to continue, as well as prevention of mother-to-child transmission, "all other PEPFAR-funded services are being reviewed for assessment of programmatic efficiencies and consistency with United States foreign policy."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The department did not respond to NPR's questions about when the review would be completed and what the 6.6 million orphans and vulnerable children, as well as their caregivers, should do in the meantime. The statement did say that children and adults who are both HIV-positive and malnourished can get food support. While Diana has lost her food packages and is often hungry, she is not considered malnourished, according to Pastor Billy and Mukuka.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;How budget negotiations unfold will likely impact which parts of PEPFAR continue.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Everything was stopped, and it's not coming back — except [HIV] treatment," says one U.S. civil servant who has spent years working at high levels on the United States' HIV/AIDS efforts and who requested anonymity because they are concerned that speaking out could harm their career. This civil servant said none of the staff members involved in the orphans program was moved to the State Department when the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) was dismantled as an independent agency.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Since the foreign aid freeze was announced, &lt;a href="https://worldwithoutorphans.org/forum/speaker/susan-hillis" target="_blank"&gt;Hillis&lt;/a&gt; has been reaching out to her network of colleagues and friends all over the world to better understand their situation. That network was built up during the 25 years she spent at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a senior adviser with a focus on HIV and vulnerable children. She then spent seven years at PEPFAR. During Trump's first term, she was picked to lead a $100 million initiative to use faith-based groups to advance HIV/AIDS work. She was let go on the ninth day of Trump's second term.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Between emails, phone calls and text messages, Hillis has been keeping track of the situation on the ground in a variety of countries. "Now, a lot of families with orphans are hungry," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In that airport line in Thailand, Hillis remembers panicking about Diana's fate.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71512" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;"I just thought, 'This little girl's gonna die. She has no chance unless someone can get her medicine in the middle of rural Zambia. Who's gonna do that?'" she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flashing back to the death of his twin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For Pastor Billy, there was a very personal sense of urgency. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Growing up in Kitwe, Zambia, he was one of 13 children. During meals in the family's three-room house, he always sat next to his twin sister and best friend: Charity. "We [would] eat from the same plate," he says. And they'd play. She'd kick the soccer ball with him. He'd skip rope with her. "We were so close. It was lovely."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;When the twins became teenagers, Pastor Billy says that a businessman lured Charity away. This businessman promised a more luxurious lifestyle than their family could offer. The twins' father was a cook at the local hospital.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But when Charity returned from spending time with the businessman, she was sick.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"She developed something like a rash — when she pressed [the lesions], water [came out]," remembers Pastor Billy. The rash spread all over her face and arms and soon down to her legs. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71256" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Pastor Billy lost his twin sister, Charity, to HIV/AIDS. After she was diagnosed in 1989, he cared for her at home. She died about two years later. "It brought me to my knees," he remembers.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;At the clinic in Kitwe, she was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. At the time, in 1989, there were no medications or treatments for AIDS in Zambia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So Billy nursed her at home in their kitchen. Soon, she couldn't walk or even stand. Still today, he can instantly conjure up the image of her skeletal frame and the smell that permeated through the house as her condition deteriorated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Sometimes if I [was] out, she would be calling for me," he says. "There was one time I stopped going to school, like for a month, because she only wants me to be around."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Two years after her symptoms started, Charity died. "It brought me to my knees," Pastor Billy remembers. "It brought me to a point where [I realized] no matter what I can do as a human being, there is a limit. But at that time of sensing that limitation, I turned to God."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He became a pastor in 1994 as HIV/AIDS pounded the country and region. Until the 1980s, life expectancy had been steadily rising in Zambia. But as the HIV epidemic took off, life expectancy plummeted from 56 to 46 over the course of 15 years, according to &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/aboutunaids/unaidsleadership/bios/mary-mahy" target="_blank"&gt;Mary Mahy of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71251" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;When PEPFAR was founded in 2003, there were &lt;a href="https://press.un.org/en/2003/afr773.doc.htm" target="_blank"&gt;more than 10 million children globally&lt;/a&gt; who had lost one or both parents to AIDS. "When children are deprived of a parent early in life, they have a significantly increased risk of exposure to violence, abuse, neglect, exploitation, school dropout, poverty," explains Hillis. She co-authored a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)00401-5/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;paper in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt; in May&lt;/a&gt; citing research showing that, across 14 countries, children who have lost one or both parents are at six times the risk of contracting HIV.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Part of what drove Bush to incorporate orphans and vulnerable children into PEPFAR was a religious sense of compassion, says &lt;a href="https://www.avenirhealth.org/profile.html?name=Stover" target="_blank"&gt;John Stover&lt;/a&gt;, vice president at Avenir Health, a group that analyzes data and policies for public health programs. "[Bush] had a lot of support from Christian groups — evangelicals and others — who were largely focused on improving the lot of children in Africa," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There was also a practical reason for caring for this group of children, says &lt;a href="https://globalhealth.duke.edu/people/beyrer-chris" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Chris Beyrer&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Duke Global Health Institute. Children who had lost their parents were "perceived to be very vulnerable to groups like militias and extremist organizations and gangs," he explains, pointing out that this was one of the reasons President Bill Clinton declared AIDS a threat to national security.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;"No, no, no, no, no"&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pastor Billy also saw AIDS as a threat. As a new pastor, he saw members of his congregation start falling ill just like Charity had. "They were showing symptoms of my twin sister," he recalls. "I was like, 'No, no, no, no, no.'"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The funerals became so frequent that Pastor Billy was sometimes burying people several times a week. Even on Sunday, it would be a quick Mass and, then, to the graveyard. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When services wrapped up, he'd often have another time-sensitive task: figuring out what would happen to the orphaned children. He'd scramble to find relatives and community members to take them in, given the stigma of being associated with an AIDS death. And if nothing else worked, he and his wife would open their home.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"My wife's nursing our first child — [and] she's now a mother of seven," he remembers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"It felt like a miracle"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 1996, far from Zambia, there was an extraordinary turn of events, says Beyrer. Fifteen years after AIDS came on the scene, a very effective treatment was discovered: a combination of drugs that could suppress the virus's replication to extremely low levels.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The results are often described in biblical terms.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"People who are on their deathbeds, wasting away with diarrhea and thrush and fevers, would get on these meds and, literally, rise up off their deathbeds," says Beyrer. "That's what was called the Lazarus effect — like Lazarus raised from the dead." The patients, he says, would "gain weight and go back to school and parenting and working. And it felt like a miracle."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But this was a miracle only for high-income countries. Prior to PEPFAR, the treatment cost so much that it was essentially unavailable for people in sub-Saharan Africa, where the epidemic was the worst. Only when PEPFAR was established did low- and middle-income countries partake in the miracle.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"In Scripture, Jesus said, 'I will not leave you as orphans,'" says Pastor Billy, recalling the passage that captured his relief when, in 2004, PEPFAR arrived in Zambia. "Despair was taken away from families."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71679" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Pastor Billy delivers a sermon in April to his congregants at the Somone Community Centre, a branch of the Pentecostal Holiness Church in Zambia. He remembers that at the height of the AIDS crisis in the 1990s, the funerals became so frequent that he was sometimes burying people several times a week. Even on Sunday, it would be a quick Mass and, then, to the graveyard.

   &lt;p&gt;Hillis remembers a trip to Africa, after PEPFAR was launched, where she realized that the roadside carpenters were no longer displaying caskets for sale — a brisk business when AIDS was at its height. Instead, they were lining the street with handmade beds. "Both of them you lay down in," Hillis remembers thinking to herself. But one, "you lay down to rest because you're going to get up in the morning and live a vibrant life."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As the drugs enabled parents to survive and give birth to children who were not infected with the virus, Pastor Billy focused more fully on the orphans who'd been left behind.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was in 2016 when he met Diana, just days after she was born. He'd been helping her mother during a rough pregnancy where she was "always sick." And he went to the hospital hoping to celebrate another child born HIV-free to an HIV-positive mother, thanks to modern medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But as Diana's first year unfolded, it became clear that she needed to be tested for HIV. She "was always suffering from diarrhea. She was weak, always underweight," recalls Pastor Billy. He was left wondering whether her mother hadn't taken her HIV medicine as consistently as necessary. He helped get Diana tested for HIV, and then, once the results confirmed his suspicion, he made sure she got on medication to suppress the virus at one of the U.S.-funded clinics in town.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Diana's life stabilized until two devastating family deaths. The girl's mother passed away as she neared her third birthday. Diana moved in with her grandmother — and Pastor Billy and his wife started to help more. For several years, Diana and her grandmother stayed in the pastor's house whenever they walked the 7 miles into town to access the clinic. And in 2021, when Diana's grandmother died, Diana moved in.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"You see pieces of brokenness at different stages in her life," says Pastor Billy. "My heart usually bends toward brokenness."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For a year, Diana grew up among his own children. She often reminded Pastor Billy of his twin sister.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then, in 2022, Pastor Billy and his wife faced a difficult decision. The church asked them to move to a city four hours away. He wanted to take Diana but also felt she would benefit from staying in Kapiri Mposhi, the only place she'd really known. Plus, he had dreams of continuing his religious studies in the U.S. and knew it could be logistically challenging to formally adopt Diana so that she could travel with his family.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So Pastor Billy took the new assignment — but makes a point to visit Diana in her new home regularly. Whenever he does, Diana's face lights up. In that smile, he felt a sense of hope: Diana's generation might be the last one so badly scarred by AIDS, he thought.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Others felt the same. "We've been so close to truly having an AIDS-free generation of kids," says &lt;a href="https://health.mountsinai.org/blog/meet-rachel-vreeman-md-ms-director-of-the-arnhold-institute-for-global-health-at-mount-sinai/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Rachel Vreeman&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the Department of Global Health and Health Systems Design at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. "And that is completely at risk right now."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"There isn't enough food"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In February of this year, Diana had her first hint that something was amiss.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On that 20-minute walk to school, dreams of her future stethoscope were accompanied by pangs of hunger. The monthly packages of food the U.S. had provided for Diana had stopped. And Jennifer Mukuka had lost the stipend she got for transporting medications from Diana's U.S.-funded HIV clinic to far-flung patients.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, there's often not enough food in the three-room house they share with Mukuka's adult daughter and two young grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71401" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                Outside Jennifer Mukuka's three-room house, where Diana now lives, Mukuka prepares a lunch of pumpkin leaves and groundnuts. Sometimes, Mukuka says, the family has only enough food to cook one meal a day of beans and a maize porridge called nshima.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"Sometimes we just have one meal per day," explains Mukuka. "In the evening, we just cook porridge."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In a quiet voice and speaking in Bemba, her native language, Diana says, "Because there isn't enough food, I sometimes don't feel well." HIV medication must be taken with food; otherwise it can make the person feel very unwell — one of the reasons PEPFAR usually provided food along with drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's not just food that's in short supply. Her drugs are no longer readily available. Diana's U.S.-funded clinic closed so quickly after the stop-work orders came out in late January that Mukuka couldn't get Diana's medical file or a transfer letter allowing her to restart care at a Zambian government-run clinic. So Mukuka travels to nearby clinics begging for medication to last Diana until they can get the documents she needs to transfer to the government clinic — or until the U.S.-funded clinic reopens, if it does.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The State Department has issued waivers that lifesaving treatment can continue, including treatment and care for HIV. In an emailed statement, the department said that the organizations implementing lifesaving HIV programs "were notified and urged to resume approved service delivery. Agencies have been working with their implementers to resume activities as quickly as possible." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, many U.S.-funded clinics have not resumed services yet. Where Diana lives, PEPFAR funding for HIV clinics came via USAID, which has been dismantled by Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. Without USAID, it has been hard for services and programs to resume even if they receive a waiver. Diana's former clinic has not reopened.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Pastor Billy has lost hope that it might open its doors again. "It's closed forever," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We go to different centers, and [we're] just literally scrounging for medication. Sometimes they give us a two-week supply, sometimes a one-week supply," says Mukuka, also speaking in Bemba.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71519" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                "I stress myself [out] thinking about Diana — and me, myself, we are almost the same," says Jennifer Mukuka, who is also HIV-positive and who takes care of Diana. When she couldn't get Diana HIV medications because of the U.S. aid cuts, she shared her own medicine.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;But a handful of times, the scrounging hasn't yielded anything. That means they are sometimes entirely out of Diana's medications. Mukuka says she wakes up in the middle of the night worried about what to do.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I stress myself [out] thinking about Diana — and me, myself, we are almost the same," says Mukuka, who is also HIV-positive. She recalls her nighttime debate about whether she should give Diana her own HIV pills that she gets from a government hospital.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She weighs the dilemma: Diana is young with her whole life ahead of her — she needs the pills. But Diana is also reliant on her, as are her daughter and grandchildren. In the end, she settled on an answer: "Rather than letting her go without medication, I give her my medication," says Mukuka. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That worries Pastor Billy, who says: "God save Diana. That she doesn't develop symptoms because the dosage was too much or was less or it might be wrong."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even then there are crisis points — like the night of Feb. 20, when Pastor Billy learned that Diana was entirely out of medicine. Eventually that night, he found a man one town over from Diana who could help. "He said, 'We can share for five days,'" recalls Pastor Billy, who quickly went to his church to solicit donations for the money needed to transport the medications in a shared taxi from the nearby town to Diana's town.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Diana has, at times, gone a week or two without her medication, Mukuka admits. She knows that when people skip their daily HIV medications, the virus can become drug resistant. "When I couldn't get medication for Diana, I was extremely stressed," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pastor Billy and Mukuka have spent months trying to get Diana's file from the clinic so she can register at the closest government hospital. The Zambian Ministry of Health did not respond to requests for comment about why its medical facilities require past medical files, given the situation. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As they navigate the process, Diana has been taking whatever supply they can get. "Two weeks, one week, two weeks, sometimes even days," says Pastor Billy. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But this past week, he says, he breathed a sigh of relief when he got a phone call announcing that she had been able to get a month's supply of her medication from the district hospital. "She's now getting the medicine, but the consistency is [still] not there," he says, noting that she used to get a six-month supply.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says he feels surrounded by warnings about what might happen. At his church, others are falling ill without their HIV medications. And he has sent Hillis a message about how he's starting to notice that carpenters are displaying caskets again on the roadside.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Kids will go hungry"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the Trump administration has, in the days and weeks following the inaugural proclamations about frozen aid, made a commitment to providing lifesaving treatment like Diana's drugs, the prospect of other support for AIDS orphans — food, clothing, bedding, school fees, counseling — is less promising.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Kids will go hungry. Kids will drop out of school. Kids will be subjected to transactional sex to be able to survive. This is exactly what will happen," says the U.S. civil servant who requested anonymity for fear of retribution. "It's just absolutely atrocious, in my opinion, that we're now bringing back, potentially, another generation of HIV-positive young people, which could have been totally avoided."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Goosby, who used to run PEPFAR, is adamant that the entirety of the program for orphans and vulnerable children should be allowed as part of the waiver for lifesaving aid.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What could be more lifesaving than taking a child, feeding them and educating them?" he says, arguing that interventions that aren't a pill can still be lifesaving.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It really, truly does feel that we are going backward," adds Beyrer of Duke.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71685" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Pastor Billy and Diana share a close bond. When Pastor Billy visits Diana, she lights up with a smile. Here, they share a laugh before she walks to school.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;For Diana and Mukuka, their hope is pinned to small snacks and thin plastic baggies — some filled with about a quarter cup of flour, others with a similar amount of sugar. They use whatever money Pastor Billy can spare to buy the supplies and sell them to neighbors. Each goes for under 20 cents. They hope it will add up to enough money for food and the basics for school — books, notebooks and a uniform. But Mukuka must also feed her daughter and grandchildren — and pay rent.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On a Wednesday in April, Pastor Billy got up early to make the hourslong drive to check on Diana. He caught her before she set off on her walk to school. She lit up, as usual, when she saw him. She calls him "father." They took pictures together, making goofy faces.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then it was time for her to head to school — and for Pastor Billy to drive back home, wondering what to do next. These months of uncertainty, along with the frantic searches for medicine and food, have highlighted the vulnerability of the systems he used to depend on — and also Diana's vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He got into the car thinking that his plans to study religion in the U.S. might need to take a back seat to Diana's needs. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Love is not somebody who visits and takes a picture and puts it on the fridge," he says. Perhaps, he thinks,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;he and his wife should stay in Zambia — and adopt Diana.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71248" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

It’s in gummies, capsules, powders, and teas—promising everything from stress relief and better sleep to more energy and even extra strength at the gym. People love it. It’s been around for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine, so most folks figure it’s safe. And for the most part, it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here's the plot twist no one saw coming: more and more reports are linking ashwagandha to liver problems—some of them pretty serious, and in rare cases, even fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What? Liver damage from Ashwagandha?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it sounds wild, but there’s growing evidence. According to LiverTox (a database run by the NIH), there have been real, documented cases of liver injury linked to ashwagandha. Most people didn’t notice anything until about 2 to 12 weeks after they started taking it. Then—bam—symptoms like yellowing of the skin (jaundice), dark pee, and intense itching showed up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10531359/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;out of India between 2019 and 2022 reported 23 people who developed liver issues after taking just ashwagandha—nothing else. Eight of those were using single-ingredient products. Most of them got better once they stopped taking it, but sadly, three people with pre-existing liver problems died from acute-on-chronic liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So what’s going on?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts aren’t 100% sure why ashwagandha affects the liver in some people, but the current theory points to certain compounds in the herb called withanolides—especially one called withanone. In high doses or over long periods, these may mess with the liver’s detox system, particularly the glutathione system. Basically, it’s like overloading your liver’s cleanup crew until they can't keep up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liver damage tied to ashwagandha isn’t only happening in one place. Reports from Iceland, the U.S., and Europe have all confirmed cases. Some were serious enough to require hospitalization—and at least one person needed a liver transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;European health agencies have flagged at least 22 severe liver injury cases, and that’s likely just scratching the surface. To put it in perspective, herb-related liver damage makes up about 20% of all liver injuries caused by drugs and supplements, and yep—ashwagandha is on that list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is liver toxicity?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, here’s the deal with liver toxicity—it’s basically your liver waving a red flag and saying, “Hey! I’m overwhelmed here!” Your liver is like your body’s detox center. It filters out all the junk—alcohol, meds, processed food chemicals, pollution, even herbal supplements sometimes. But when you overload it with too much of anything, it starts to struggle, and that’s what we call liver toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, this doesn’t mean your liver fails overnight. Liver toxicity can build up slowly and quietly. Some common signs? You might feel super tired all the time, have yellowing skin or eyes (that’s jaundice), stomach pain, dark pee, itchy skin, or even lose your appetite. Sometimes, it’s so sneaky that people don’t notice until something serious shows up in a blood test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What causes it? Well, heavy alcohol use is a classic culprit. But guess what—some over-the-counter painkillers like acetaminophen (paracetamol) can also mess with your liver if taken in high doses. Even “natural” stuff like ashwagandha, kava, or green tea extract in supplement form can trigger toxicity in some people. Your liver doesn’t care if it came from a pharmacy or a plant—if it’s too much, it’s too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news? The liver is a tough organ and can often heal itself if you catch the problem early. Cut down on booze, ditch unnecessary supplements, eat clean, and drink plenty of water. And if you feel “off” for too long, don’t guess—get a liver function test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Should You Freak Out?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily. Millions of people use ashwagandha regularly and never have a problem. Critics of the scare point out that, with over a million U.S. users as of 2020, 23 reported cases is still a pretty tiny risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s a good reminder that "natural" doesn’t always mean "harmless." Like anything else you put in your body, moderation and awareness are key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here’s What You Can Do&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re using ashwagandha—or thinking about trying it—here’s your game plan:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep your dose reasonable. Most studies use between 150 mg to 600 mg per day. Don’t go overboard just because you think “more = better.” That’s not how herbs work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skip it if you have liver problems. If you’ve had any kind of liver issue in the past, it’s probably best to steer clear, at least until you talk to a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t mix it with everything under the sun. Taking ashwagandha along with other supplements or medications—especially those that affect the liver—can increase the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen to your body. If you start noticing signs like yellow skin, nausea, dark urine, or weird fatigue, stop taking it and check in with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider getting liver tests. If you’ve been using it long-term or at high doses, it might be worth getting some basic blood work done just to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ashwagandha’s got a lot of reputation for it—lowering stress, improving sleep, boosting mood. But it’s not a magic pill, and recent liver injury cases are a solid reminder that even the most hyped “natural” supplements can come with side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to swear off ashwagandha forever. Just be smart about how you use it.

She would ask the same question multiple times, be bedbound from migraines and unstable on her feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mystery behind her decades-long ailments was seemingly solved when she was diagnosed with &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-d8d8b240-47b8-11f0-a1bc-256a2104db0b"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease in June 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sean said: ‘We had spent countless hours fretting over what could be wrong, but not once did I think it could be early-onset Alzheimer’s. That diagnosis belongs to other families, I thought. Not ours.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Fischers met with renowned neurologists and prepared the then-61-year-old to participate in an Alzheimer’s clinical trial for the drug varoglutamstat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then came devastating news that meant Mrs Fischer wouldn't be eligible for the trial - she was suffering from &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-2242332/Cerebrospinal-fluid-leak-Woman-dies-brain-fluid-leak-months-Arizona.html"&gt;a persistent leak of spinal fluid&lt;/a&gt; somewhere in her spinal system, but doctors couldn't pinpoint the source - and couldn't fix it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They believed it was likely a result of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-9266007/New-mum-lie-flat-stop-excruciating-headaches-C-section-caused-brain-leak.html"&gt;epidurals she'd received during childbirth&lt;/a&gt; - an injection in the back that numbs a person from their belly button to their thighs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's a common pain relief option during childbirth and an estimated 61 percent of women who give birth receive an epidural. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After suffering for more than a decade, doctors said a new procedure would allos them to inject &lt;span&gt;dye into Mrs Fischer's spinal fluid to search for the leak - a small spot in the middle of her back. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A few weeks after they sealed it, all of her symptoms went away and doctors said she didn't actually have Alzheimer's - &lt;/span&gt;the tiny spot in her back was actually the source of all her symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sean Fischer's mother, 61, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease after years of worsening memory, severe migraines, balance problems, and nausea. But they had no idea the source of her problems was a fixable spinal fluid leak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Fischer's &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thefp.com/p/sean-fischer-my-moms-alzheimers-diagnosis"&gt;health battle began&lt;/a&gt; long before her Alzheimer's diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It started in spring 2001, when Sean said he received a call from his dad: Mom had pulled over on the highway, vomiting from a sudden, crushing headache. Her doctor called it a migraine, but months later she lost hearing in one ear and was diagnosed with Ménière’s disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She adjusted — avoiding movements that triggered vertigo, wearing a hearing aid in her forties, and taking daily meds for the headaches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even as she quietly suffered, Sean &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thefp.com/p/sean-fischer-my-moms-alzheimers-diagnosis?utm_source=x&amp;amp;utm_medium=paid-social_&amp;amp;utm_campaign=marketing_evergreen&amp;amp;utm_adgroup=ret&amp;amp;utm_content=alzheimers&amp;amp;utm_adid=1924872245341823240&amp;amp;twclid=275q9y2oonhono4qjy71vk3yuu"&gt;wrote &lt;/a&gt;for The Free Press, she stayed steady for him and his brothers, never missing a soccer game, school musical, or packed lunch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2010, neurologists at Columbia University diagnosed her with a Chiari malformation, a structural defect where the brain is pushed through the opening at the base of the skull. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They suspected the malformation was caused by a cerebrospinal fluid leak, sparked by her three epidurals from the births of each of her sons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Epidurals are extremely safe and are administered by inserting a needle in the space of the lower spine just outside the membrane that surrounds the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It delivers anesthetic medication, which numbs the lower half of the body and blocks pain while allowing the patient to stay awake and alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, it can occasionally result in a leak if the needle punctures the thin, tough membrane surrounding the spinal cord containing the CSF, called the dura mater. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An epidural is a safe, widely used method of pain relief during childbirth, delivered by inserting a needle into the epidural space in the lower spine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When this happens, some of the fluid that cushions and protects the brain and spinal cord can leak out into surrounding tissues. It can only be patched up surgically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The leak had, over the years, led to a loss in cerebrospinal fluid volume, causing her brain to sink. This can lead to severe headaches, nausea and vomiting, hearing changes, memory problems, and double vision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I started high school in 2015, and around that time, I began to notice the quiet dislocation of my mom’s mind,’ Sean wrote for &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thefp.com/p/sean-fischer-my-moms-alzheimers-diagnosis"&gt;The Free Press&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sean Fischer wrote about his mother's misdiagnosis of Alzheimer's that was really a constellation of symptoms linked to a leak of cerebrospinal fluid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When we cooked dinner together, she would have trouble following recipes. She’d stare at her calendar for long stretches of time; making sense of it seemed to require more effort than usual. She started to repeat herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘By the time I left for college in Rhode Island, the phrase “You already asked me that” had become a common refrain in the house I grew up in, but at first, we blamed her, telling her she needed to pay more attention.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was seeing doctors for headaches, hearing, and anxiety, none of whom believed there could be a common origin. Her memory problems were worsening as well, which led to Mr and Mrs Fischer to to turn to NYU Langone Health’s Center for Cognitive Neurology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My mom was tested extensively — and two months later came the diagnosis, with the finality of a punctuation mark. Alzheimer’s. When it hit her that there was no cure, my mom was bedridden for three days,’ Sean said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hope came with the study. But then doctors called the Fischers and informed them that the CSF leak would not allow her to participate.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despair took over.&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a few weeks later, Mrs Fischer’s doctor called to tell them about recent medical innovations that would allow surgeons to find and fix the leak, allowing her to participate in the drug trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Six months later, doctors inserted a probe through the femoral artery in Mrs Fischer’s leg, fed it upward toward her spinal system, and sealed the leak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sean said: ‘Two weeks later, I visited home, and found Mom more alert than she had been in years. There was no absent look in her eyes. As the day went on, I waited for her to start fading—but she was still wide awake at 10 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘After three weeks, her vertigo was gone, and her physical therapist told her she didn’t need treatment anymore, because she no longer had any balance problems. After four weeks, she told us she felt 20 years younger.’&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After six weeks, her problems with memory were gone entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And eventually, Mom’s neurologist confirmed: She did not have Alzheimer’s. The surgeons who fixed the leak were shocked. They had never seen a recovery like it,’ Sean said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family later learned that, a year before the procedure, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center had published a newsletter with the subtitle: ‘Physicians Treating Dementia Should Look for Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak—A Treatable Cause of an Otherwise Incurable Condition.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study followed 21 patients with headaches, severe fatigue, and diagnoses of Chiari malformation and dementia; nine were found to have a cerebrospinal fluid leak, and repairing it completely resolved their symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Sean’s mother’s case, countless specialists across multiple hospitals treated her symptoms in isolation, overlooking the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But they chose not to place blame on any doctor or institution. It was the system that misdiagnosed her, and ultimately, the system that saved her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘More than anything, we feel grateful that a scientific breakthrough came at just the right time; that the real cause of her suffering was found,’ he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When back pain strikes it can be debilitating and most of us will try anything to make it feel better. After a recent bout of horrible lower-back pain (thanks to some overzealous weeding) I found &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/fitness-equipment-tech/i-tried-using-a-massage-gun-for-30-days-and-its-now-an-essential-part-of-my-muscle-recovery" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/fitness-equipment-tech/i-tried-using-a-massage-gun-for-30-days-and-its-now-an-essential-part-of-my-muscle-recovery"&gt;using a massage gun&lt;/a&gt; provided some relief—but I know that to stop this happening again I need to strengthen my back and core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I was surprised to see a PT on Instagram demonstrate how a glute bridge variation could “save” your back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Reel, Alisa from the account Movement By Alisa, can be seen performing a glute bridge with a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=110083&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fyoga-block%2Fb%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D3422271%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dfitandwell-gb-9642923965257928138-20" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.amazon.com/yoga-block/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=3422271" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=110083&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fyoga-block%2Fb%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D3422271%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id="1471" data-merchant-network="Amazonus" data-merchant-url="amazon.com"&gt;yoga block&lt;/a&gt; between her knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like anyone with a bad back, I was hopeful this move could make a big difference, but I decided to double check with an expert first, and spoke to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://relentless-spirit.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://relentless-spirit.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Baltazar Villanueva&lt;/a&gt;, NASM-certified personal trainer with experience in corrective exercise and core stabilization work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good news—Villanueva agrees this move can play a part in building the strength needed to support your back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Squeezing a ball between the knees activates the adductors (inner thighs), which are often underused,” says Villanueva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The adductors and pelvic floor work closely with the deep core muscles so by engaging them, you get more stability through the pelvis and lower back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-9fTCHV48p5y3G29NobhzmU" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-9fTCHV48p5y3G29NobhzmU slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This added stability can reduce compensations in the low back during the movement and help retrain the body to fire the glutes more effectively—both key for reducing strain and pain in the lumbar spine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how should you add this movement to your week?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I typically recommend two or three sets of 10–15 repetitions,” says Villanueva. “focusing on slow, controlled movement and a strong glute squeeze at the top. Quality over quantity is key here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exhale as you lift into the bridge to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/how-to-engage-your-core" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/how-to-engage-your-core"&gt;engage the core&lt;/a&gt; and avoid overarching the back. This is a small move with big impact—but it works best when paired with lifestyle habits like regular movement, hydration and minimizing long periods of sitting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For most people, two to three times per week is a great starting point for exercise, especially if they’re dealing with low back discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may also want to spend some time working on your core strength. “Think of the core as a brace for your spine,” says Villanueva. “When your core is strong—and that includes deep stabilizing muscles like the transverse abdominis—it reduces the load and movement demands on the spine itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This support helps prevent poor posture and protects against the kind of repetitive stress that often leads to chronic back pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good place to start is with these three &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/bodyweight-exercises/all-you-need-is-your-bodyweight-and-these-three-physical-therapist-approved-exercises-to-strengthen-an-injury-prone-lower-back" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/bodyweight-exercises/all-you-need-is-your-bodyweight-and-these-three-physical-therapist-approved-exercises-to-strengthen-an-injury-prone-lower-back"&gt;bodyweight core exercises&lt;/a&gt; recommended by a physical therapist.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;When outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles occur despite &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/measles-is-one-of-the-deadliest-and-most-contagious-infectious-diseases-and-one-of-the-most-easily-preventable-224493"&gt;highly effective vaccines being available&lt;/a&gt;, it's easy to conclude that parents who don't vaccinate their children are misguided, selfish or have fallen prey to misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As professors with expertise in &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MPOYrOkAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;vaccine policy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://publichealth.gwu.edu/departments/health-policy-and-management/avi-dor"&gt;health economics&lt;/a&gt;, we argue that the decision not to vaccinate isn't simply about &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11050926"&gt;misinformation&lt;/a&gt; or hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our view, it involves &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-theory/"&gt;game theory&lt;/a&gt;, a mathematical framework that helps explain how reasonable people can make choices that collectively lead to outcomes that endanger them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game theory reveals that vaccine hesitancy is not a moral failure, but simply the predictable outcome of a system in which individual and collective incentives aren't properly aligned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Game theory meets vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game theory examines how people make decisions when their outcomes depend on what others choose. In his research on the topic, &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1994/nash/facts/"&gt;Nobel Prize-winning mathematician John Nash&lt;/a&gt;, portrayed in the movie &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Beautiful Mind&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, showed that in many situations, individually rational choices don't automatically create the best outcome for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination decisions perfectly illustrate this principle. When a parent decides whether to vaccinate their child against measles, for instance, they weigh the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvacx.2023.100268"&gt;small risk of vaccine side effects&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/measles-can-ravage-the-immune-system-and-brain-causing-long-term-damage-a-virologist-explains-252354"&gt;risks posed by the disease&lt;/a&gt;. But here's the crucial insight: The risk of disease depends on what other parents decide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If nearly everyone vaccinates, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22599-herd-immunity"&gt;herd immunity&lt;/a&gt; – essentially, vaccinating enough people – will stop the disease's spread. But once herd immunity is achieved, individual parents may decide that not vaccinating is the less risky option for their kid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, because of a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.embor.7401134"&gt;fundamental tension&lt;/a&gt; between individual choice and collective welfare, relying solely on individual choice may not achieve public health goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="align-right zoomable"&gt;&lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/672251/original/file-20250604-74-8f08j3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="A public health messaging poster for the polio vaccine featuring an illustration of a bee with red stripes and text promoting the vaccine's benefits" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/672251/original/file-20250604-74-8f08j3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=237&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/672251/original/file-20250604-74-8f08j3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=728&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/672251/original/file-20250604-74-8f08j3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=728&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/672251/original/file-20250604-74-8f08j3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=728&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/672251/original/file-20250604-74-8f08j3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=914&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/672251/original/file-20250604-74-8f08j3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=914&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/672251/original/file-20250604-74-8f08j3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=914&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A 1963 poster featuring Wellbee, the CDC's national symbol of public health, encouraged people to get the polio vaccine. (&lt;a class="source" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Polio_vaccine_poster.jpg"&gt;CDC via Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes vaccine decisions fundamentally different from most other health decisions. When you decide whether to take medication for high blood pressure, your outcome depends only on your choice. But with vaccines, everyone is connected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This interconnectedness has played out dramatically in &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/08/texas-measles-spread-oklahoma-new-mexico/"&gt;Texas, where the largest U.S. measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in a decade originated. As vaccination rates dropped in certain communities, the disease – once declared eliminated in the U.S. – returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One county's vaccination rate &lt;a href="https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/health/measles-texas-vaccine-vaccination-rates-schools-dfw-fort-worth-dallas/287-1c321c7d-d1ff-4326-ae9b-eec5c9100699"&gt;fell from 96% to 81% over just five years&lt;/a&gt;. Considering that &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/what-to-know-about-measles-and-vaccines"&gt;about 95% of people in a community&lt;/a&gt; must be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, the decline created perfect conditions for the current outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't coincidence; it's game theory playing out in real time. When vaccination rates are high, not vaccinating seems rational for each individual family, but when enough families make this choice, collective protection collapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The free rider problem&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dynamic creates what economists call a &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/free-rider/"&gt;free rider problem&lt;/a&gt;. When vaccination rates are high, an individual might benefit from herd immunity without accepting even the minimal vaccine risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989X211053563"&gt;Game theory predicts something surprising&lt;/a&gt;: Even with a hypothetically perfect vaccine – faultless efficacy, zero side effects – voluntary vaccination programs will never achieve 100% coverage. Once coverage is high enough, some rational individuals will always choose to be free riders, benefiting from the herd immunity provided by others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when rates drop – &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.8952"&gt;as they have, dramatically&lt;/a&gt;, over the past five years – disease models predict exactly what we're seeing: the return of outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game theory reveals another pattern: For highly contagious diseases, vaccination rates tend to decline rapidly following safety concerns, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0403823101"&gt;while recovery occurs much more slowly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, too, is a mathematical property of the system because decline and recovery have different incentive structures. When safety concerns arise, many parents get worried at the same time and stop vaccinating, causing vaccination rates to drop quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But recovery is slower because it requires both rebuilding trust and overcoming the free rider problem – each parent waits for others to vaccinate first. Small changes in perception can cause &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4161/hv.7.12.17980"&gt;large shifts in behavior&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2021.1949292"&gt;Media coverage, social networks and health messaging&lt;/a&gt; all influence these perceptions, potentially moving communities toward or away from these critical thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mathematics also predicts &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010437"&gt;how people's decisions about vaccination can cluster&lt;/a&gt;. As parents observe others' choices, local norms develop – so the more parents skip the vaccine in a community, the more others are likely to follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game theorists refer to the resulting pockets of low vaccine uptake as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2008.0271"&gt;susceptibility clusters&lt;/a&gt;. These clusters allow diseases to persist even when overall vaccination rates appear adequate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 95% statewide or national average could mean uniform vaccine coverage, which would prevent outbreaks. Alternatively, it could mean some areas with near-100% coverage and others with dangerously low rates that enable local outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154579" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154579" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/VaccinationWearingMasksCovid642.jpg" alt="A masked healthcare worker vaccinating a senior woman " class="wp-image-154579 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/VaccinationWearingMasksCovid642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/VaccinationWearingMasksCovid642-620x415.jpg 620w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/VaccinationWearingMasksCovid642-600x402.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154579" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;About 95% of people in a community must be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. (Prostock-studio/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Not a moral failure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this means that the dramatic fall in vaccination rates was predicted by game theory – and therefore more a reflection of system vulnerability than of a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10508422.2023.2285750"&gt;moral failure of individuals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, blaming parents for making selfish choices can also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.36959/856/485"&gt;backfire by making them more defensive&lt;/a&gt; and less likely to reconsider their views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much more helpful would be approaches that acknowledge the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4161/hv.19616"&gt;tensions between individual and collective interests&lt;/a&gt; and that work with, rather than against, the mental calculations informing how people make decisions in interconnected systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;People make decisions by balancing individual and collective interests – a calculation that's crucial for how infectious diseases spread.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2021.08.019"&gt;communities experiencing outbreaks respond differently&lt;/a&gt; to messaging that frames vaccination as a community problem versus messaging that implies moral failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2021 study of a community with falling vaccination rates, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03843-2"&gt;approaches that acknowledged parents' genuine concerns&lt;/a&gt; while emphasizing the need for community protection made parents 24% more likely to consider vaccinating, while approaches that emphasized personal responsibility or implied selfishness actually decreased their willingness to consider it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This confirms what game theory predicts: When people feel their decision-making is under moral attack, they often become more entrenched in their positions rather than more open to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Better communication strategies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding how people weigh vaccine risks and benefits points to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2024.2361943"&gt;better approaches to communication&lt;/a&gt;. For example, clearly conveying risks can help: The &lt;a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/pediatrics-articles/measles-is-still-a-very-dangerous-disease"&gt;1-in-500 death rate from measles&lt;/a&gt; far outweighs the extraordinarily rare serious vaccine side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may sound obvious, but it's often missing from public discussion. Also, different communities need different approaches – high-vaccination areas need help staying on track, while low-vaccination areas need trust rebuilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consistency matters tremendously. Research shows that when health experts &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actpsy.2022.103534"&gt;give conflicting information or change their message&lt;/a&gt;, people become more suspicious and decide to hold off on vaccines. And dramatic &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-using-fear-to-promote-covid-19-vaccination-and-mask-wearing-could-backfire-153865"&gt;scare tactics about disease can backfire&lt;/a&gt; by pushing people toward extreme positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making vaccination decisions visible within communities – through community discussions and school-level reporting, where possible – can help &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2024.06.006"&gt;establish positive social norms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When parents understand that vaccination protects vulnerable community members, like infants too young for vaccines or people with medical conditions, it helps bridge the gap between &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/phe/phaa008"&gt;individual and collective interests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health care providers remain the &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-and-trust/poll-finding/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-vaccine-safety-and-trust/"&gt;most trusted source of vaccine information&lt;/a&gt;. When providers understand game theory dynamics, they can address parents' concerns more effectively, recognizing that for most people, hesitancy comes from weighing risks rather than opposing vaccines outright.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256975/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

A scoop of ice cream or a fistful of chips can soothe more than the soul. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have long noticed the same comfort-seeking reflex in lab animals, hinting that something in the very act of eating can turn down the volume on pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon, known as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3226930/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ingestion analgesia&lt;/a&gt;, crops up even when the “meal” is a single lick of sugar water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that food might blunt discomfort has usually centered on the brain’s reward circuits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet a growing body of work is pulling the spotlight toward the nerves that sit outside the skull. These peripheral messengers, it turns out, don’t just ferry pain – they can hush it, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enter-trpv1-and-d₂o"&gt;Enter TRPV1 and D₂O&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have discovered a novel way to relieve pain by targeting TRPV1, a key ion channel involved in sensing heat and physical discomfort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of using conventional painkillers, the approach uses &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_water" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heavy water (D₂O)&lt;/a&gt; to subtly alter the channel’s behavior, effectively reducing its overactivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRPV1 is best known for triggering the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mild-chili-peppers-may-be-the-anti-spice-weve-been-looking-for/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;burning sensation from chili peppers&lt;/a&gt;, but it also plays a central role in many types of pain, with the added benefit of being non-addictive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-comfort-food-s-secret-side-effect"&gt;Comfort food’s secret side effect&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For rodents, a nibble of chocolate during a mild heat test leads to fewer squeaks and squirms. Scientists traced the mellowing effect to hormones that surge as digestion kicks in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief among them is glucagon-like peptide-1, or &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/weight-loss-drugs-unexpectedly-help-people-drink-less-alcohol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;GLP-1&lt;/a&gt;, a gut signal that rises when nutrients hit the small intestine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In humans, GLP-1 keeps blood sugar in check by nudging the pancreas to release insulin, but its life in the bloodstream is fleeting – barely one or two minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drugmakers have stretched that clock by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/natural-alternative-to-ozempic-glp-1-fgf21-may-soon-be-available-for-humans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;crafting GLP-1&lt;/a&gt; analogs that linger for hours. These longer-lasting versions already help people with type 2 diabetes and, more recently, individuals seeking weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same molecules have been shown to sap pain inside the brain and spinal cord, raising a simple, tantalizing question: could they also soothe pain at the nerve endings scattered through skin, joints, and organs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trpv1-channel-the-gatekeeper"&gt;TRPV1 channel – the gatekeeper&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fresh experiments suggest the answer is yes. GLP-1 appears to shoulder past a notorious gatekeeper of pain, the TRPV1 channel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of TRPV1 as a molecular thermostat: when capsaicin from a pepper, a hot stove, or acidic conditions switches it on, ions rush through its pore, igniting a pain signal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/patients-with-chronic-pain-are-turning-to-cannabis-for-relief/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;chronic pain disorders&lt;/a&gt;, the channel can become hypersensitive, turning even a light touch into agony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/12180212/TRPV1_water-permeability_drug-free-pain-relief_credit-NBE_1m.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/12180219/TRPV1_water-permeability_drug-free-pain-relief_credit-NBE_1s.webp" alt="Tracking the water permeability of TRPV1 using up-conversion nanoprobes in single live cells.

Click image to enlarge. Credit: Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Directly blocking TRPV1 has helped in animal tests, but the strategy often wreaks havoc with body temperature, leaving patients flushed or chilled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 seems to take a subtler route. Instead of wedging the channel shut, it tweaks TRPV1 just enough to stop the excess firing while sparing the body’s heat control. The result is a calmer signal with no feverish side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cooling-down-a-hot-channel"&gt;Cooling down a hot channel&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details of that tweak came into sharper focus thanks to a collaboration that stretched from Singapore to Beijing. Professor Liu Xiaogang of the &lt;a href="https://nus.edu.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;National University of Singapore&lt;/a&gt; and colleagues had pivoted from hormones to water – specifically, heavy water, or D₂O. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their team fashioned a luminescent nanoprobe able to tell ordinary H₂O from its heftier cousin as the molecules darted through single TRPV1 pores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When D₂O slipped through the channel, pain signals in nerve cells sputtered. In living models of both acute and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/people-with-chronic-pain-have-high-rates-of-depression-and-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;chronic inflammatory pain&lt;/a&gt;, injections of D₂O eased sensitivity without muting other nerve reflexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trpv1-pain-management-strategy"&gt;TRPV1 pain management strategy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery deepens our understanding of TRPV1 function and lays the groundwork for new pain-management strategies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team now plans to investigate how D₂O influences additional ion channels, aiming to adapt this mechanism for treating neurological disorders and other clinical challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solvent-mediated pathway to analgesia stands out as a major advance in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/chronic-pain-is-harder-to-treat-in-women-but-a-new-target-offers-hope/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pain therapy&lt;/a&gt; and could usher in safer, non-addictive options for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although calming an overactive channel with solvent molecules may sound unconventional, D₂O is already well known in nuclear reactors and biochemical laboratories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In small doses it poses little risk, making it an appealing complement – rather than a replacement – to existing drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-happens-next"&gt;What happens next?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pair GLP-1 analogs with the solvent trick and a two-pronged strategy emerges: tamp down abnormal TRPV1 activity while letting the body keep its natural thermostat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That approach could offer relief to millions who live with neuropathic pain, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/oregano-herb-helps-reduce-and-prevent-joint-pain-from-arthritis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt;, or lingering post-surgical aches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are all conditions where current options rely heavily on opioids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, both of which are carry-overs from the last century and are not without drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical translation will demand careful dosing studies, long-term safety checks, and creative formulations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the blueprint is simple: use a compound we already make after every meal, fortify it so it sticks around, and harness its knack for silencing wayward pain channels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add a dash of heavy water for extra finesse, and the humble act of eating might inspire the next generation of pain relief – no prescription for comfort food required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-024-01288-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?

&lt;p&gt;Byrne said it’s important to know the official definition of binge drinking. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/binge-drinking.htm" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888383" data-affiliate="true"&gt;The CDC says&lt;/a&gt; having five drinks or more on an occasion for men and four drinks or more for women is considered binge drinking. “I think it’s less than a lot of people think,” Byrne noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about it: If you’ve ever been to a wedding where there’s cocktail hour, dinner, dancing and often an after-party, you know how easy it is to have four or five drinks during the celebration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What you do with alcohol is completely up to you, and just because you drink more than what’s considered binge drinking on a single occasion doesn’t necessarily mean you have an alcohol addiction or an alcohol problem,” Byrne said. “I want to make that clear, too, but technically speaking, that is the definition of binge drinking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Pay close attention to &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you’re drinking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who do choose to drink, Brooks said it’s important to pay attention to three things: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The frequency and quantity of your drinking: Use the CDC’s guidelines to assess how much and how often you’re drinking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why you’re drinking: “Ask yourself, what is it that I think this drink will do for me?” Brooks said, adding that if you’re using alcohol to de-stress, let loose or be more social, know that you can do this without drinking. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there something else you can do or drink instead of alcohol? “Because there are actually so many ways that we can achieve those benefits that people think they’re getting from drinking, we can get all of those things without drinking,” Brooks said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you are saying, ‘Well, I just need this drink because I just need to relax’ ... that alcohol itself isn’t actually what helps you relax. [What can give you that effect can] be the sitting, taking a break from what you’re doing or going to happy hour and talking to people, connecting to people, getting a change of scenery,” Brooks explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can still relax without a glass of wine. You could take up coloring or take a bath with a seltzer by your side instead of a glass of wine, or you could go out for a walk for an after-work change of scenery, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If somebody believes that having that drink at the end of the day is their way to relax, then just by default they’re not thinking about other ways that they actually could decompress,” Brooks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond thinking about your intention with alcohol, it’s important to look at any red flags, too. “If you think your drinking might be problematic, ask yourself why you’re doing it,” Byrne said, “and if you’re doing it to avoid certain feelings or numb certain feelings, then that’s something to question and probably a reason to reassess your relationship with alcohol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, it’s also a good idea to reach out to a therapist who’s trained in substance use treatment who can support you, Byrne added. The &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888383" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Psychology Today website&lt;/a&gt; can help you find a local mental health provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Brooks noted that changing your drinking habits is not an easy feat. If you are trying to do this, it’s a good idea to lean on loved ones who have a similar mindset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Need help with substance use disorder or mental health issues?

The finding suggests that environmental chemicals in the gut may fuel immune responses tied to mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They set out to discover how one gut bacterium might play an active role in major depressive disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Harvard and the Broad Institute focused on &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27421818/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Morganella morganii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a gut bacterium previously &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00991-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to depression, type 2 diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their aim was to pinpoint a specific molecule that connects the bacterium to inflammation and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/teens-with-problematic-smartphone-use-suffer-from-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/bioassay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bioassay&lt;/a&gt; approach, they discovered unusual &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/phospholipid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;phospholipids&lt;/a&gt; made by &lt;em&gt;M. morganii&lt;/em&gt;. These lipids mimic cardiolipins but include an environmental contaminant, diethanolamine (DEA), instead of the usual glycerol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-contaminant-triggers-inflammation"&gt;Contaminant triggers inflammation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;em&gt;M. morganii&lt;/em&gt; adds a chemical called DEA to its fats (lipids), it changes the molecule in a way that triggers the body’s immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tests showed that this new molecule turns on special sensors in immune cells called &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2014.00461/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;TLR1 and TLR2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once these sensors are activated, the immune cells release a substance called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4176007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;interleukin-6 (IL-6)&lt;/a&gt;. IL-6 causes inflammation and has been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7139933/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to depression in genetic studies, suggesting it plays a role in mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a story out there linking the gut microbiome with depression, and this study takes it one step further, toward a real understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the link,” said senior author Jon Clardy, the Christopher T. Walsh, PhD Professor of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology in the &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/research/blavatnik-institute" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Blavatnik Institute&lt;/a&gt; at HMS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-immune-system-and-bacterial-lipids"&gt;Immune system and bacterial lipids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that special lipids from &lt;em&gt;M. morganii&lt;/em&gt; – called MmDEACLs – can kickstart the immune system by attaching to two receptors, TLR1 and TLR2, which are known for spotting bacterial molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This set off the release of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a signaling protein linked to long-term inflammation and immune-related illnesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here’s the twist: only the versions of these lipids that contained DEA caused a strong IL-6 response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that small changes in the shape of the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/fatty-acids" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;fatty acid chains&lt;/a&gt; – like having a double bond instead of a ring – made a big difference in how strongly the immune system reacted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shows that our immune system can pick up on very fine molecular details in bacterial chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-matters"&gt;Why this matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery offers strong molecular evidence that gut bacteria altered by environmental pollutants can influence immune pathways tied to depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It suggests &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/people-with-depression-often-hold-tightly-to-self-doubt/"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; may have an autoimmune or inflammatory component in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also raises the possibility that DEA‑modified lipids could serve as biomarkers, helping to identify individuals whose depression may stem from this mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We knew that micropollutants can be incorporated into fatty molecules in the body, but we didn’t know how this occurs or what happens next,” Clardy said. “DEA’s metabolism into an immune signal was completely unexpected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chronic-gut-inflammation-and-depression"&gt;Chronic gut inflammation and depression&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term exposure to&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5805548/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; inflammatory signals&lt;/a&gt; like IL-6 has been repeatedly linked to the development of depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevated IL-6 levels are often found in people with major depressive disorder and can disrupt normal brain signaling, especially in mood-related areas like the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This supports the idea that &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493173/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, sparked by environmental contaminants processed by &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983973/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, could act as a biological trigger for depression in some individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than being purely psychological, these cases might respond better to treatments that target the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work follows earlier &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8001875/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; where individual gut bacteria and their molecules were tied to inflammation, immune modulation, and disease outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also strengthens the gut‑immune‑brain concept by adding a contaminant‑mediated chemical twist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-environment-and-mental-health"&gt;Environment and mental health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The role of diethanolamine (&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetic-ingredients/diethanolamine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DEA&lt;/a&gt;) in this study highlights the broader impact of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11352651/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;environmental micropollutants&lt;/a&gt; on human biology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEA is widely used in industrial processes and personal care products, and its presence in the environment means exposure is nearly unavoidable for most people in developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a common bacterium like &lt;em&gt;M. morganii&lt;/em&gt; transforms DEA into an immune-stimulating molecule, it creates a new layer of interaction between pollution, the microbiome, and the immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This connection raises public health concerns about how chemical exposures might shape disease risks in ways not previously considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-treating-depression-in-the-gut"&gt;Treating depression in the gut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers note that while the mechanism is clear, further work is needed to determine how often this occurs in depressed individuals and whether blocking this pathway alleviates symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They plan to explore whether other gut microbes use similar chemical substitutions and what portion of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-too-much-salt-may-contribute-to-depression/"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; cases might involve this contaminant‑inflammation route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now that we know what we’re looking for, I think we can start surveying other bacteria to see whether they do similar chemistry and begin to find other examples of how metabolites can affect us,” said Clardy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By revealing how a gut bacterium turns a common contaminant into a pro‑inflammatory agent, the study offers new insight into the complex makeup of mental health disorders, and hints at novel ways to detect and treat them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/194993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sunghee Bang&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Heart disease and type 2 diabetes affect millions of people across the United States every year.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While many of us are aware of common lifestyle changes to help reduce the risks, like staying active, maintaining a healthy weight and getting enough sleep, what we eat plays a major role too. A &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-protein-benefits-11712145" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diet rich in plant-based foods&lt;/a&gt;, like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes, may do wonders for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-for-gut-and-heart-health-8771784" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;supporting heart health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290068/12-healthy-ways-to-lower-your-blood-sugar/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;managing blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;But there’s one lesser-known piece of the puzzle that’s worth exploring further: phytosterols.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Phytosterols, sometimes called plant sterols, are naturally occurring compounds found in plants. What makes phytosterols special is their ability to block cholesterol absorption in the digestive system, which may help lower LDL (the "bad" cholesterol) levels. And new data shared at the American Society for Nutrition meeting in Orlando highlighted the potential impact consuming phytosterols may have on aspects of our overall health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To conduct this study, researchers gathered and analyzed data from three large cohorts involving over 200,000 adults in the United States. The participants, who were nurses and other health professionals, provided health and dietary information over a follow-up period of up to 36 years. By using food-frequency questionnaires, the researchers estimated the participants’ intake of total phytosterols and three specific types (β-sitosterol, campesterol and stigmasterol). Participants were then categorized into quintiles based on their phytosterol intake, with the highest quintile representing the most plant-forward diets.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beyond dietary data, the researchers collected biological samples from participants to analyze metabolic biomarkers and other health indicators. Blood samples from over 11,000 participants were examined to identify metabolites and markers related to insulin regulation, inflammation, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-you-have-metabolic-syndrome-8694742" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;. Additional blood samples from more than 40,000 participants were analyzed to detect specific biomarkers linked to heart disease and type 2 diabetes. These biomarkers offered insights into potential mechanisms through which phytosterols might influence disease risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To explore a potential link between phytosterol intake and gut health, the study also investigated the microbiome composition of a subset of 465 participants. Advanced genetic sequencing techniques were used to identify specific microbial species and enzymes present in these individuals' gut microbiomes. The goal was to examine whether certain microbes altered the metabolism of phytosterols in ways that contributed to lower disease risk. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did The Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The results of this study showed that those who consumed higher amounts of phytosterols experienced impressive health benefits. Participants in the top quintile of phytosterol intake had a 9% lower likelihood of developing heart disease and an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lignans-may-reduce-risk-of-diabetes-according-to-study-8696870" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;8% lower risk of type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; when compared to those in the bottom quintile. These findings suggest that even within the range of normal dietary intake, phytosterols may make a meaningful difference in reducing the risk of these chronic diseases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Further analysis revealed that participants who consumed higher levels of total phytosterols and β-sitosterol had favorable changes in their metabolic markers. The researchers found evidence linking higher phytosterol intake to improved insulin regulation, lower levels of inflammation, and the presence of healthier metabolites. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, when it comes to gut health and phytosterol consumption, researchers identified microbial species and enzymes in the gut microbiome that were associated with higher phytosterol intake. For example, species like &lt;em&gt;Faecalibacterium prausnitzii&lt;/em&gt; were linked to the degradation of phytosterols, potentially influencing the production of beneficial metabolites. This suggests that a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; might amplify the positive effects of phytosterols, per the researchers.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While this study offers valuable insights, it’s important to note a few limitations. Since it’s an observational study, it can only suggest a link between phytosterol intake and a lower risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes, rather than proving a direct cause-and-effect relationship. Most of the participants were health professionals, which means the results might not fully reflect the broader population. Additionally, the dietary information was self-reported through food-frequency questionnaires, which could include some errors or misremembered details. The study also found connections between phytosterol intake, microbiome changes and metabolic markers, but we still need more research to understand how these connections work. Lastly, the long follow-up period was helpful for tracking outcomes, but changes in diet and lifestyle over time, which weren’t entirely accounted for, could have played a role in the findings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Also, these results are not published in a peer-reviewed journal, which means they should be interpreted with caution until further scrutiny validates the findings.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re curious about where to start, here’s a list of phytosterol-rich foods you can consider adding to your diet:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Nuts (such as almonds, pistachios and walnuts)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seeds (like sunflower seeds and flaxseeds)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Legumes (including lentils and chickpeas)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fruits (such as oranges, apples and avocados)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vegetables (like broccoli, Brussels sprouts and carrots)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole grains (such as oats, quinoa and barley)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vegetable oils (canola, sunflower and olive oil)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By including these foods in your daily meals, you might enjoy the added benefit of lowering LDL cholesterol levels and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-improve-metabolic-syndrome-8742510" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supporting metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;. Something as simple as sprinkling seeds over your salad, choosing whole-grain bread, or swapping out snacks for a handful of nuts can make a big difference over time.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This new study presented at an American Society for Nutrition meeting highlights the compelling potential of phytosterols in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/eating-more-protein-may-reduce-heart-disease-risk-8422551" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;promoting better heart and metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;. Across the three large cohorts studied, higher phytosterol intake was associated with a 9% lower risk of heart disease and an 8% lower risk of type 2 diabetes, which is especially significant given the prevalence of these conditions in the United States. The findings also revealed that individuals with diets rich in phytosterols saw &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-reduce-insulin-resistance-for-better-blood-sugar-8750433" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;improvements in insulin regulation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-top-nutrients-to-fight-inflammation-8675325" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;reduced inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, pointing to their role in fostering overall metabolic balance.

In the U.S., an &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/getmedia/ef8f48f9-ad36-48ea-87f9-b74034635c1e/alzheimers-facts-and-figures.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.alz.org/getmedia/ef8f48f9-ad36-48ea-87f9-b74034635c1e/alzheimers-facts-and-figures.pdf" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;estimated 7.2 million Americans ages 65 and older&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are living with Alzheimer's dementia in 2025. The percentage of affected people increases with age: About 5% of people ages 65 to 74 have Alzheimer's, compared with more than 33% of people ages 85 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the point when a doctor has verified that a patient has cognitive decline, the blood test can be used in place of standard tests to see if they likely have Alzheimer's. Previously, gold-standard methods of diagnosing Alzheimer's have been more invasive and expensive, involving positron emission tomography (PET) scans, which use radioactive substances; and lumbar punctures, (also called spinal taps) during which a clinician uses a needle to sample spinal fluid from the low back. Clinicians also sometimes use &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/in-depth/alzheimers/art-20048075" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/in-depth/alzheimers/art-20048075" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;MRIs or CT scans&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to rule out other causes of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new test measures the ratio of two proteins in human blood, and this ratio correlates with the presence or absence of amyloid plaques, a primary sign of Alzheimer's found in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people experiencing memory lapses that might be due to Alzheimer's, the first step is to see their primary care physician (PCP), who should do a cognitive test. If there are signs of cognitive impairment, the patient would then be referred to a neurologist for an in-depth evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both dementia specialists and PCPs will be able to order this blood test to help with diagnosis, said &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/day-gregg-s-m-d/bio-20478797" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/day-gregg-s-m-d/bio-20478797" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Gregg Day&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist with the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida; Day led a study of the blood test published in June in the &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70316" target="_blank" data-url="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70316" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Journal of the Alzheimer's Association&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Researchers analyzed data from over 15,000 U.S. adults, comparing their mental health surveys with saliva samples to assess microbial diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings show that people with less diverse oral microbiomes were more likely to experience depression, even after accounting for factors like smoking and dental care. While the direction of this link is still unclear, the study suggests the oral microbiome may one day be used to help diagnose or treat mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microbial Diversity Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; People with lower oral microbiome diversity showed more depressive symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle Factors Influence Microbes:&lt;/strong&gt; Smoking, drinking, and dental care affected the depression-microbiome link.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagnostic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; With further research, oral bacteria could serve as biomarkers for depression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;NYU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A rich and varied mix of microbes in the mouth, particularly bacteria, is not only important for our oral health, but may hold clues for other conditions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study led by researchers at NYU Rory Meyers College of Nursing finds that a lower diversity of microbes in the mouth is associated with depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mouth is home to between 500 billion and 1 trillion bacteria—the second-largest community of microorganisms in our bodies, after the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing number of studies point to the connection between the oral microbiome and our overall health, from diabetes to dementia, a relationship thought to be driven by inflammation and disruptions to the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study in mice found a potential link between depression and the diversity of bacteria in the gut, but less is known about the connection between the oral microbiome and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having a better understanding of the relationship between the oral microbiome and depression could not only help us learn about the mechanisms underlying depression, but could contribute to the development of new biomarkers or treatments for mood disorders,” said Bei Wu, vice dean for research at NYU Rory Meyers College of Nursing and the senior author of the study, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;BMC Oral Health&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore the connection between the oral microbiome and depression, the researchers examined survey and biological data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using data from more than 15,000 US adults ages 18 and older collected between 2009 and 2012, the researchers compared questionnaires measuring symptoms of depression with saliva samples. Gene sequencing was used to identify the microbes in the saliva and measure the diversity of the oral microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that people with less diversity in their oral microbiomes were more likely to have symptoms of depression. Additional analyses showed that smoking, drinking, and dental care—all of which can change the makeup of bacteria in the mouth—influenced the relationship between the oral microbiome and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that, with more research, the oral microbiome could potentially be used to diagnose or treat depression. However, based on this study, it’s not clear whether the diversity of microbes in the mouth influences depression or if depression leads to changes in the oral microbiome—or if there’s a bidirectional relationship between the two.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s possible that the oral microbiome influences depressive symptoms through inflammation or changes to the immune system. Conversely, depression can drive changes including dietary intake, poor oral hygiene, increased smoking and drinking, or the use of medications—all of which have the potential to alter the oral microbiome,” said Wu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need more research to understand the direction and underlying pathways of this relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work is part of a broader effort to understand how the oral microbiome influences not only mental health, but also cognitive decline and the onset of dementia,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional study authors include Xichenhui Qiu, Ting Xu, Yiqing Huang, Changning Wei, and Lina Wang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this microbiome and depression research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#83f1e2e0ebe6efadebe2f1f1eaf0ecedc3edfaf6ade6e7f6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rachel Harrison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nyu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NYU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Rachel Harrison – NYU&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12903-025-06274-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Relationship between depression and oral microbiome diversity: analysis of NHANES data (2009–2012)&lt;/a&gt;” by Bei Wu et al. &lt;em&gt;BMC Oral Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relationship between depression and oral microbiome diversity: analysis of NHANES data (2009–2012)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the association between the gut microbiome and depression is well studied, the association between the oral microbiome and depression is less well characterized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This cross-sectional study analyzed the association between depression and diversity of oral microbiome using data from the 2009–2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The gene sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA was adopted for the profiling of oral microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alpha diversity, quantified by the observed number of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), and beta diversity, assessed using Bray–Curtis dissimilarity, were evaluated to represent oral microbiome diversity. Depressive symptoms were measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scale, with alpha diversity as the primary predictor. Weighted logistic regression was employed to examine the relationship between depression and microbial alpha diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Threshold effect analysis was performed to explore potential nonlinear relationships between the observed ASVs and depression. Subgroup analysis indicated that smoke, excessive alcohol consumption, and oral treatment influenced the association between oral microbiology and depression, with interaction effects observed across gender and racial groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beta diversity differences were evaluated using Bray–Curtis dissimilarity and visualized via non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 15,018 participants were included, with an average age of 42.25 ± 15.2 years. In the fully adjusted model, the alpha diversity of oral microbiome was significantly negatively correlated with depression (OR = -0.51, 95% CI: -0.79—-0.23, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.003). Threshold analysis also revealed a nonlinear association in this relationship, with a significant inflection point as Log10ASVs of 2.32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, beta diversity of the oral microbiome differed significantly between the normal and depression groups (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001). Sensitivity analyses showed that the relationship between depression and oral microbial diversity observed in this research was particularly pronounced among non-Hispanic Whites (OR = 0.16, 95% CI: 0.07–0.35) and men (OR = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.06–0.30). Additionally, significant differences in oral microbiome beta diversity were observed between the normal and depression groups (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that the diversity of oral microbiome is negatively correlated with depressive symptoms. Hence, oral dysbiosis may serve as a therapeutic target or biomarker of depression. However, the underlying mechanisms require further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 21:56:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFAtVUhMOEQyd1p6Mmc1SVRBQkFNbTRLRW50V0pxS0VkMVFXSzFpS05XTWFneG9XSkF0ZGtIOURyTjREdThTeHBVS0RKTEc2SFd5WTAxTmc0M0YzVVRTSEt1Vm8tSjNPekFKa2loVENodw</guid></item><item><title>可以“从内到外吃掉你”的致命真菌现在在美国，并迅速蔓延到世界各地- Earth.com | Deadly fungus that can 'eat you from the inside out' is now in the U.S. and quickly spreading around the world - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixwFBVV95cUxQOUEwX2NZUWdFeFJ5SWRnLUNtRzMxT2V5YW05VERMR05lbmdsajM4ZWRLYnYtTkpDdGI4T24yTE12dUk5cENYSXlIOV9ONGV4ODF2dks3NWdOVFlCTGozOC1UamxTdkRtLWdLaUdrME85am9YaXBPNll0WkF0NkhTZ25pbVY0WjFyQ09XdnpFMW9oUmF5dWdKZWFwSHNTYjNjT25TNjJyc015RHhzRzhVSGV2MHBnZmwwNGhfcWJtSjBzbE9nOEVF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine inhaling hundreds of invisible spores every day.

In short, they can wreak massive havoc and leave death in their wake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most molds and fungi are helpful, but some fungus and mold will jump from hospital wards to honeybee hives, and the line between helpful recycler and harmful invader grows blurrier each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, healthy immune systems swat away dangerous spores and fight off infection. Trouble arises when weakened defenses, rising temperatures, and heavy fungicide use tip the scales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the same fungus that quietly decomposes the fallen leaves in your yard can trigger relentless coughs, damage corn silos, and shrug off medicines that once kept it in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aspergillus-fungus-easily-adapts"&gt;Aspergillus fungus easily adapts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After studying fungal threats for years, Dr. Norman van Rhijn and colleagues at &lt;a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The University of Manchester&lt;/a&gt; mapped how three notorious Aspergillus species – &lt;em&gt;A. flavus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;A. fumigatus&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;A. niger&lt;/em&gt; – might spread through the end of the century. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They fed climate change scenarios into global models and watched the virtual spores drift. One scenario (SSP585), which assumes a fossil-fuel-dependent future, paints an unsettling picture: habitats across Europe become markedly friendlier to these pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspergillus fungus thrives because its genome bends easily to new pressures. It lives on soil, grains, animal feathers, even coral skeletons. Out in the wild, it recycles nutrients, but on farms and in clinics, the story shifts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farmers spray &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/super-fungus-is-among-us-drug-resistant-fungi-is-thriving-in-every-corner-of-the-earth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;azole fungicides&lt;/a&gt; to protect wheat and peanuts; doctors use nearly identical azole drugs to save patients with lung infections. That overlap nudges Aspergillus toward drug resistance – similar to bacteria evolving against &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/earth-rivers-are-highly-saturated-with-human-antibiotics-helping-bacteria-develop-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-climate-reshapes-global-mold-map"&gt;Climate reshapes global mold map&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Temperature, humidity, and extreme weather events dictate where spores settle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Changes in environmental factors, such as humidity and extreme weather events, will change habitats and drive fungal adaptation and spread,” said Dr. van Rhijn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve already seen the emergence of the fungus &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/toxic-microbes-aerosols-can-travel-thousands-of-miles-through-the-air/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Candida auris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; due to rising temperatures, but, until now, we had little information on how other fungi might respond to this change in the environment.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that fungi remain “relatively under-researched compared to viruses and parasites,” yet the new maps show they will likely reach “most areas of the world in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/12133204/Aspergillus_global-distributions_map_credit-MaxENT_1m.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/12133212/Aspergillus_global-distributions_map_credit-MaxENT_1s.webp" alt="MaxENT model accurate described Aspergillus global distributions.

Click image to enlarge. Credit: University of Manchester&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those maps point to striking numbers. Under the high-emissions pathway, the range of &lt;em&gt;A. flavus&lt;/em&gt; in Europe could jump about 16 percent, potentially putting another one million people at risk of infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A. fumigatus&lt;/em&gt; – the chief culprit behind invasive aspergillosis – could expand its European footprint by 77.5 percent, threatening up to nine million more residents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Africa, paradoxically, parts of the continent may become too hot for some fungi to survive, hinting at complex regional trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-forecasting-aspergillus-fungus-spread"&gt;Forecasting Aspergillus fungus spread&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forecasting pathogens decades ahead may sound speculative, but it builds on earlier warnings. Hospitals already grapple with Aspergillus fungus outbreaks after building renovations or severe dust storms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, intensive-care units report stubborn cases in patients recovering from influenza or COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising outdoor spore loads could translate to more &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-do-deadly-molds-attack-the-immune-system-of-humans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hospital admissions&lt;/a&gt; and costlier treatments, especially because diagnostics for fungal infections lag far behind those for bacteria or viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mycotoxin contamination adds another layer. A single year of heavy Aspergillus growth can saddle the U.S. corn industry with losses topping $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased heat and humidity extend the window for mold growth in silos and fields, forcing farmers to discard grain or blend batches to dilute toxins – strategies that still carry economic and health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-current-drugs-don-t-work"&gt;Current drugs don’t work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Azole resistance has climbed steadily in Europe and Asia. Patients with resistant Aspergillus fungus infections face mortality rates exceeding 50 percent, partly because alternative drugs can damage the kidneys or liver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each hectare treated with agricultural azoles raises the odds that environmental spores will carry resistance genes into hospitals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public-health agencies now track these genes in soil and compost piles, hoping to spot trouble before it reaches intensive care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fungicide demand is also changing. As some African regions exceed the thermal limits for certain molds, farmers elsewhere may spray more to protect lengthening growing seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That feedback loop – more fungicide, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/soil-plays-an-overlooked-role-in-antibiotic-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stronger resistance&lt;/a&gt; – complicates food security and patient care alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-farms-food-and-rising-bills"&gt;Farms, food, and rising bills&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspergillus isn’t the lone shapeshifter. &lt;em&gt;Fusarium&lt;/em&gt;, which devastates wheat and oat fields, and &lt;em&gt;Cryptococcus&lt;/em&gt;, an opportunistic pathogen in AIDS patients, also respond to warming climates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fungal pathogens pose a serious threat to human health by causing infections and disrupting food systems. Climate change will make these risks worse,” explains Viv Goosens of &lt;a href="https://wellcome.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Wellcome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To address these challenges, we must fill important research gaps. By using models and maps to track the spread of fungi, we can better direct resources and prepare for the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aspergillus-fungus-and-human-health"&gt;Aspergillus fungus and human health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fungi account for an estimated 1.5 to 3.8 million species, yet fewer than 10 percent carry official descriptions, and only a sliver have sequenced genomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scarcity of basic data hinders vaccine development and slows the hunt for safer drug targets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing this blind spot, the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; added Aspergillus fungus and &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; species to its priority list for emerging threats in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers now call for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/future-of-food-safety-ai-can-detect-contamination-early/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;coordinated monitoring&lt;/a&gt; – combining air quality sensors, agricultural sampling, and hospital surveillance – to trace spore movement in near-real time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such efforts could flag hotspots, guide fungicide regulations, and spark investment in rapid diagnostics. Without them, today’s manageable mold may evolve into tomorrow’s silent pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No single fix will erase the risk. Cutting greenhouse gas emissions limits the environmental changes that favor Aspergillus fungus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smarter fungicide policies slow resistance on farms. Better ventilation in buildings reduces indoor spore counts, while new antifungal classes extend doctors’ toolkits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Piece by piece, these steps can keep an ancient decomposer from becoming an outsized menace in a warming world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6545782/v1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Research Square&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 21:42:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxQOUEwX2NZUWdFeFJ5SWRnLUNtRzMxT2V5YW05VERMR05lbmdsajM4ZWRLYnYtTkpDdGI4T24yTE12dUk5cENYSXlIOV9ONGV4ODF2dks3NWdOVFlCTGozOC1UamxTdkRtLWdLaUdrME85am9YaXBPNll0WkF0NkhTZ25pbVY0WjFyQ09XdnpFMW9oUmF5dWdKZWFwSHNTYjNjT25TNjJyc015RHhzRzhVSGV2MHBnZmwwNGhfcWJtSjBzbE9nOEVF</guid></item><item><title>经过一系列的肿瘤，女人奇怪的舌头解释了一切--Ars Technica | After a series of tumors, woman’s odd-looking tongue explains everything - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxNeThPYktJZUdmMlpuWmFYM3VaOUh2aE5PeUg4Y2dyNFZfM0FydUE2aVdlM3NoMUdBY2hCaTBJZlM0V0FNOElwbkhIaV9PRmdxWjNwSE5tQWdRVnJzZmVTSE15QjNKd2NJX21GeFpjSHg3V2R4VlM3WkNSbkIzenJYdElaem5aOHFUNVhXWnc4M1FZaDZRMWFNekVrOUxsVF8xbEF6WF9LaFBCQzZQdW9F?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;Breast cancer. Colon cancer. An enlarged thyroid gland. A family history of tumors and cancers as well. It wasn't until the woman developed an annoying case of dry mouth that doctors put it all together. By then, she was in her 60s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2835072"&gt;a new case study in JAMA Dermatology&lt;/a&gt;, the woman presented to a dermatology clinic in Spain after three months of oral unpleasantness. They noted the cancers in her medical history. When she opened wide, doctors immediately saw the problem: Her tongue was covered in little wart-like bumps that resembled a slippery, flesh-colored cobblestone path. (Image &lt;a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/dim250007f1_1748619232.52078.png"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a cobblestone tongue is a telltale sign of a rare genetic condition called &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525984/"&gt;Cowden syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. It's caused by inherited mutations that break a protein, called PTEN, leading to tumors and cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PTEN, which stands for phosphatase and tensin homolog, generally helps keep cells from growing out of control. Specifically, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004221004065"&gt;PTEN deactivates a signaling protein called PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate), and that deactivation blocks a signaling pathway (the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway) involved in regulating cell growth, survival, and migration. When PTEN is broken, PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; activity ramps up, and tumors can grow unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not-so-rare mutation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Cowden syndrome, PTEN mutations lead to noncancerous tumors or masses called hamartomas, which can occur in any organ. But, people with the syndrome are also at high risk of developing a slew of cancerous growths—most commonly cancers of the breast, thyroid, and uterus—over their lifetime. That's why people diagnosed with the condition are advised to undergo intensive cancer screenings, including annual ultrasounds of the thyroid starting at age 7 and annual mammograms and MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging) starting at age 30 at the latest.&lt;/p&gt;

            Prenatal exposure to a class of dangerous, widely used chemicals could be linked to your child having high blood pressure as a teen, according to a new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvv00083b6m3pffytrh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/09/health/pfas-explainer-wellness/index.html"&gt;PFAS&lt;/a&gt; — sometimes called “forever chemicals” because they don’t fully break down in the environment — are a class of about 15,000 human-made chemicals linked to &lt;a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/news-events/news/2023/pfas-kidney-cancer-mec" target="_blank"&gt;cancers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7926449/" target="_blank"&gt;endocrine-related conditions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9976729/" target="_blank"&gt;developmental problems&lt;/a&gt; in children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw00093b6mxbrs2c8h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            New data shows the synthetic compounds could also be linked to a teen’s risk of developing cardiovascular disease later in life, according to the study published Thursday in the &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.039949" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000a3b6me38v9g0e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers looked at data from 1,094 children over an average of 12 years. The study team compared measurements of eight types of PFAS chemicals in maternal plasma samples 24 to 72 hours after birth and the children’s blood pressure from medical records, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000b3b6mk5x624si@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The kids who were exposed to higher levels of PFAS chemicals in utero were more likely to have higher blood pressure in childhood and adolescence, the research found. The connection was particularly strong in adolescents, male children and Black children, said senior study author Dr. Mingyu Zhang, assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000c3b6mvcbp8ejw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study is observational, meaning that while it shows associations, it cannot prove that PFAS exposure is the cause of the elevated blood pressure, Zhang said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000d3b6mu0h79gfs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While researchers did adjust for other factors that could be at play, there could be other elements driving the connection between PFAS and blood pressure, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000e3b6mochkptok@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That said, the results are strong because this study is one of the largest and most diverse while also using rigorous methods, said Dr. Carmen Marsit, Rollins Distinguished Professor of Research at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health in Atlanta. He was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000f3b6mrpcn6j08@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The topic is important to investigate because if a child has high blood pressure, they are more likely to also have higher blood pressure later on, Zhang said. And that is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the No. 1 cause of death in the United States.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000g3b6m4b6eskxf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The largest effects were shown in adolescents who were exposed to a mixture of different PFAS chemicals during pregnancy compared with those who were not, which implies that there may be a synergistic impact on cardiometabolic health, Marsit said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000h3b6mac3daaim@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most children will be exposed to multiple different PFAS chemicals, so this is worrisome,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000i3b6m7ki8f4g9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The fact that adolescence is the age when prenatal exposure to PFAS is most linked with higher blood pressure suggests that some of the PFAS chemicals could take a long period of time to show their impacts, Marsit said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000j3b6mgj1c6ct0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A long latency of the effects would mean that people don’t just need to worry about reducing exposures, but interventions also need to be developed to prevent the health outcomes in people who were exposed earlier, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000k3b6ml1rtwhui@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Not only are PFAS forever chemicals –– they also are everywhere chemicals.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000l3b6m0pakojdp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Data from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey&lt;/a&gt; shows that this class of chemicals can be found in nearly every person in the United States, Marsit said &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/09/health/pfas-explainer-wellness"&gt;in a previous CNN story.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000m3b6mywq959jd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are things you can do to reduce your exposure, however, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000n3b6macy6vjlh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Major sources of exposure include food, water, and waterproof or stain-resistant items, Marsit said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000o3b6m6rsis85p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Helpful steps include drinking filtered water –– using filters like those listed by the Environmental Working Group –– out of metal or glass containers, he said. Plastics contain PFAS and other toxic chemicals, Marsit said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000p3b6mowkak1px@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A focus on fresh food can also help, as packaging for foods are often coated in PFAS chemicals, he added. And avoid using nonstick cookware, opting instead for metal, cast-iron or ceramic pots and pans, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000q3b6m84utj4tc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dusting, vacuuming, and washing your hands before eating or drinking can also reduce PFAS exposure, Marsit said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000r3b6mtn01owi5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Healthy lifestyle choices can reduce the risk of high blood pressure for children who have been exposed to PFAS, Zhang said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000s3b6m1ejcki1s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These include maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet, reducing salt intake, and encouraging physical activity,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000t3b6m1h1a2z27@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But ultimately, an individual cannot solve PFAS exposure alone, Zhang said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000u3b6mdoolqdbh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We also need policy-level actions to limit and phase out PFAS use in products and industry, and to strengthen monitoring and regulation of PFAS in water systems,” he added.

Coffee, tea, energy drinks, the works.” For the first three years of her program, she was the only one on her team who drank coffee, so she brought in one of her thrift store coffee makers to keep herself fueled during long days at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm a coffee addict, so I own 2-3 coffee makers at any given time,” she shares, adding that she always keeps a backup just in case her favorite machine breaks down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, she was the only one who used the office coffee maker, but everything changed in her fourth year when a new postdoctoral associate, Anne, joined the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anne is...a nice person. Friendly. The kind of person you'd take your lunch breaks with or chat with at a company outing,” she writes. But despite Anne’s pleasant demeanor, working with her proved to be challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anne’s presence quickly became overwhelming. The poster admits, “She's always right, and my input is irrelevant (even though I'm more experienced in our field).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation escalated as Anne’s social habits started interfering with work. “She will literally insert herself into my personal space, hovering around my desk until I agree to chat with her about usually total nonsense,” the woman explains, recalling a time Anne wanted to discuss dishwashers at length. The constant interruptions got so bad that she switched to a remote and hybrid work setup just to stay productive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anne also turned out to be a fellow coffee lover, however. “For the first time in over 4 years, my crappy little coffee maker had a second user. And I was happy to share the machine,” she says. Anne became so reliant on the coffee maker, however, that she stopped making coffee at home. As the poster shares, “I am her source of caffeine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, as graduation approaches and the woman prepares to leave for good, she faces a moral quandary. “Would I be the a—--- if I took my coffee maker with me?” she wonders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock photo of a woman working in a lab&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one hand, she acknowledges that Anne would continue to get plenty of use out of the machine, and she herself doesn’t technically need it, since her new workplace provides free coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, Anne’s difficult behavior over the years lingers in her mind. “Anne hasn't exactly been a great coworker. She's made it hard for me to feel productive and intelligent in my position, and I'm petty,” she admits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenters are offering helpful feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writes one, "Be a grownup. "Anne, as you know, I'm leaving on [date in the future]. I just want to make sure you're aware that i brought the coffee maker from home, and I'm taking it with me when I leave." Done. Fair notice, and she can get her own for $20-$30 (or, obviously, more)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On principle, it's your coffeemaker. You would not be an AH to take it when you leave," adds another. "HOWEVER, if it's just going to sit at home and be literally unused as a 3rd backup coffeemaker, and simply take up space in your home for no reason, then you're literally just hoarding/cluttering up your home."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/office-upset-as-grad-plans-to-take-coffee-maker-on-her-way-out-reddit-11753517" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 18:56:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE1SUC1yOENRSkFMWDVXS1dwZHhBODVaWDI0ZUFHYkdHNlhVa1VHeEZlRXlST0RlTktNVzdPbUVTWnF0cFdEYXVVQVFlRFZoV0xXNkJIQjRGQ0JlZVZ6VXVKN191ZjFhMGgxZDEwdE9LdlVMdXRUQURr</guid></item><item><title>患有麻疹的女性参观了普莱诺教堂、咖啡馆；达拉斯首例确诊病例- NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth | Woman with measles visited Plano church, coffee shop; 1st case confirmed in Dallas - NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQVEVWLThWbnVld0tfZ1J5UDlBa1ZBbTkwZzVldXEyTzJldlZxeE1qUGRDdERXTGF1YVdLWmtYLTBpMktoNjdRWE9rTWY1RWd3cmZTTzlielNJQ1VHOUpGMlBTX0x0TEtvZFV1LTdueXZyR0lySVM1NjRPWWpLMHJkMVFySG1OMXhiT1pDcGJQcFRvejA30gGcAUFVX3lxTFBWYlpjYVBDYTFnNWRYNTZkaW1aUXloY2xEWjYyd0ZKQm9DZjdQS0JfaE1xaHlGWmx4MmE5Yi1JemZwODlxdVlzVkhrVlM3UTNfd0xyd1pKeEFJUnhNcGluTWl4Q1JSQVcxMEl2UUNkVnBSSjBOUUE5bzVnSkJMQkt4UV9wVWc3cVJwa0dmXzB0RDB6RWxpUWpaSW9fVw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content rich-text"&gt;
									
					
&lt;p&gt;Dallas County Health and Human Services confirmed its first case of measles in a Dallas County resident for 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to DCHHS, the case involves a female in her mid-20s who was fully vaccinated. She was contagious from May 30, 2025, until June 7, 2025, DCHHS said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;DCHHS said individuals who were at the places at the times listed below may be at risk of developing measles due to exposure to the individual while she was contagious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lemma Coffee Plano&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;1023 E 15th St, Plano, TX 75074&lt;br&gt;May 31, 2025, from 9 a.m. to noon.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Baptist Plano&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;3665 W President George Bush Hwy, Plano, TX 75075&lt;br&gt;June 1, 2025, from 1 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DCHHS officials said the woman has received care, and public health officials are working to identify and notify individuals who may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to DCHHS, this is an ongoing investigation of an isolated case because the source of the woman's exposure to measles is unknown at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our priority is to protect the health and well-being of all Dallas County residents," said Dr. Philip Huang, Director at Dallas County Health and Human Services. "We are actively investigating this case and working to identify any individuals who may have been exposed. The best way to protect yourself from measles is to receive the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are required to receive full protection.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, up to nine out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most kids will recover from measles if they get it, but infection can lead to dangerous complications like pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling, and death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Is the vaccine safe?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is safe and highly effective in preventing measles infection and severe cases of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old, and the second for children between 4 and 6 years old. The vaccine series is required for kids before kindergarten in public schools nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the U.S. saw some 3 million to 4 million cases per year. Now, there are usually fewer than 200 in a normal year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no link between the vaccine and autism, despite a now-discredited study and health disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why do vaccination rates matter?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In communities with high vaccination rates — above 95% — diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called “herd immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60. Five years earlier, measles cases were the worst in almost three decades in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaines County has one of the highest rates in Texas of school-aged children who opt out of at least one required vaccine, with nearly 14% of K-12 children in the 2023-24 school year. Health officials said that number is likely higher because it doesn’t include many children who are homeschooled and whose data would not be reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are public health officials doing to stop the spread?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health workers are hosting regular vaccination clinics and screening efforts in Texas, as well as working with schools to educate people about the importance of vaccination and offering shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creatine is a popular supplement, and one that shows promise in improving your energy, strength and cognition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Taking creatine with food and directly after a workout, for example, can help you improve your strength or even gain muscle mass.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Above all, the purity and safety of the supplement outweighs nailing the timing.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Is it just us, or does it seem like &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; is obsessed with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-high-in-creatine-11731684" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;creatine&lt;/a&gt; right now? Creatine is naturally found in meat and seafood, but it’s made quite the splash in the supplement market in recent years—and for good reason. The natural compound is made of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/should-you-be-taking-an-essential-amino-acid-supplement-11715877" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;amino acids&lt;/a&gt; (the building blocks of protein) arginine, glycine and methionine that can help boost your strength and reduce your recovery time after workouts.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Creatine can also support your cognitive health, says &lt;a href="https://www.topnutritioncoaching.com/nutritionists-near-me/states-nc-charlotte#danielle-smith" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Danielle Crumble Smith, RD&lt;/a&gt;. Research shows that creatine supplementation may enhance short term memory and improve intelligence and reasoning.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With all of these potential benefits on the table, you may be wondering, is there an ideal window of time to take a creatine supplement to get the best effects? Experts say there is, but it depends on your goals as well as the type of creatine you take. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;There are several types of creatine; however, some forms are more popular and heavily researched than others. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creatine monohydrate:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the most common type of creatine, says sports dietitian &lt;a href="https://roxanaehsani.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Roxana Ehsani, RD, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s commonly used by athletes and bodybuilders looking to increase strength, muscle mass and power,” she says. Smith adds this variety is also the most studied. “This form is used in the vast majority of clinical studies and has been proven to support muscle performance, cognitive health, mood and hormonal balance across the lifespan,” she says.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creatine hydrochloride (HCl):&lt;/strong&gt; This type of creatine may be helpful for those with sensitive stomachs or experience side effects when taking other forms of creatine, Ehsani says. In other words, if you bloat easily, this supplement may be the best choice for you. Creatine HCl is often marketed as being more soluble than other forms, Smith says, which is why its recommended serving is often at a lower dose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buffered creatine, creatine ethyl ester, creatine nitrate, creatine blends: &lt;/strong&gt;These are a few other options you may see in a supplement store or sold online, but the research on their efficacy is scarce, the experts say.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-factors-affecting-creatine-absorption"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Factors Affecting Creatine Absorption  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Creatine can change the game for your health and well-being when it has the chance to flourish in your body. When it comes to identifying the best time of day to take creatine for maximum effect, you’ll want to keep these factors in mind. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Factors That Enhance Absorption &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timing with exercise.&lt;/strong&gt; “Taking creatine directly post-workout may improve the absorption rate as your body is more primed to accept these nutrients,” Ehsani says. Between increased blood flow to muscles and your cells being more insulin sensitive, creatine can enter into your muscles more quickly. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mealtime pairings. &lt;/strong&gt;“Taking creatine with a meal that includes carbohydrates and protein can enhance its absorption because insulin helps shuttle creatine into muscle cells,” Smith says. If your goal is to focus on muscle growth and strength enhancement, you’ll want to take creatine around mealtime or post-workout with an appropriate snack or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7964007/best-protein-shakes-protein-powders/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein shake&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hormonal shifts. &lt;/strong&gt;“Women’s estrogen levels impact creatine metabolism and storage,” Smith says. “During low-estrogen phases, such as post-menopause, luteal phase or when taking certain hormonal birth controls, pairing higher creatine doses with food may improve absorption and tissue uptake, which supports both physical and cognitive benefits.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Factors That Prevent Absorption &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too much creatine in muscle stores.&lt;/strong&gt; “If your muscles are already saturated with creatine, due to prolonged use, your body may absorb less of it,” Ehsani says. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dehydration. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/17576/8-hydrating-foods-to-help-you-meet-your-water-goals/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Hydration&lt;/a&gt; helps your body use creatine more efficiently, Smith says, so without adequate fluid intake, your body may not be able to reap all of creatine’s benefits. “Taking creatine when well-hydrated—and maintaining good daily fluid intake throughout the day—helps optimize both muscle uptake and cognitive energy effects.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waiting too long after a workout. &lt;/strong&gt;You can miss that prime window to maximize your muscle strength gains if you take creatine a few hours after you exercise, Ehsani says. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-potential-side-effects-and-considerations"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Potential Side Effects and Considerations  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Everyone responds to supplements differently, and creatine isn’t an exception (despite all of its benefits). A few common side effects include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stomach upset.&lt;/strong&gt; First timers may have some gastrointestinal symptoms like cramping, nausea or diarrhea. “It may be helpful to break up your dose into 2 to 3 servings per day or switch to a different form,” Ehsani says. For example, you may consider taking 2.5 milligram (mg) doses twice daily instead of 5 mg all at once. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water retention.&lt;/strong&gt; Creatine pulls fluids into your muscle cells. “When you first take creatine, you may notice some water retention in your body,” Ehsani says. “For some people this only lasts for the first few days of use.” If you feel &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8068909/sneaky-reasons-for-bloating/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bloated&lt;/a&gt;, know creatine isn’t making you suddenly gain weight. “It’s simply water shifting into muscles, which is actually beneficial for muscle hydration and function,” Smith says.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kidney stress. &lt;/strong&gt;Smith says she hears this concern quite a bit, but many studies show that creatine does not harm kidney function in healthy kidneys.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “However, those with pre-existing kidney disease should consult with their healthcare provider, as their ability to process creatine may be impaired,” Smith says. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When in doubt, talk to your health care provider or a registered dietitian to see if adding a creatine supplement to your diet is the right choice for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-choose-a-creatine-supplement"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How to Choose a Creatine Supplement &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Not only does the timing and the form of creatine matter, but how the supplement was created and tested is another big consideration to keep in mind—especially if you’re a competitive athlete. “Look for products that list creatine monohydrate as the only active ingredient,” Smith says. You want to avoid supplements that list proprietary blends and unnecessary fillers, for example.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Product purity and safety are arguably the most important pieces of information to research before buying a supplement, whether it’s a powder or capsule. “The supplement industry is not tightly regulated, and creatine is sometimes contaminated with heavy metals, solvents, or impurities from poor manufacturing,” Smith says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is why doing your research and choosing third-party tested products is vital. Look for supplements that carry one or more of these third-party certifications:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;NSF Certified for Sport&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Informed-Sport&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;USP Verified&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NSF International&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GMP Certified or cGMP Certified&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Creatine isn’t overhyped—it really can be a powerful supplement. From getting a boost in mental clarity to enhancing your recovery post-workout, creatine can help you achieve various health goals. But to get these benefits, you may want to stay hydrated and consider pairing your supplement with carbs and proteins for optimal absorption. Most important: Make sure the supplement you’re buying has undergone reputable third-party testing. Consult with a health professional if you’re not sure creatine is right for you and your health needs.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="results" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Results"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Reported Arboviral Disease Cases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 2,770 confirmed (812; 29%) and probable (1,958; 71%) domestic arboviral disease cases with illness onset in 2023 were reported to CDC (&lt;a id="T1_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#T1_down"&gt;Table 1&lt;/a&gt;). Overall, WNV accounted for 2,628 (95%) cases, followed by Powassan (49; 2%), La Crosse (35; 1%), Jamestown Canyon (27; 1%), St. Louis encephalitis (21; 1%), eastern equine encephalitis (seven; &amp;lt;1%), and unspecified California serogroup viruses&lt;sup&gt;¶&lt;/sup&gt; (three; &amp;lt;1%). Cases were reported from 772 (25%) of 3,143 U.S. counties and all 48 states in the contiguous United States and the District of Columbia (DC). More than one half (57%) of reported cases occurred in patients aged ≥60 years (except for La Crosse virus disease, incidence of which was highest in children), and 63% of all cases occurred in males.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;West Nile Virus Disease&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2,628 WNV disease cases identified in 2023 were reported from 692 (22%) counties in 46 states and DC. Similar to previous years, a majority of patients (91%) had illness onset during July–September. The median patient age was 63 years (IQR = 49–71 years), 63% were male, and 1,789 (68%) had neuroinvasive disease. A total of 1,891 (72%) patients were hospitalized, including 1,665 (88%) who had neuroinvasive disease. Overall, 194 (7%) patients with reported WNV died, including one of three patients who were infected through organ transplants received from two asymptomatic donors. The median age of all patients who died was 73 years (IQR = 66–82 years); 190 (98%) had neuroinvasive disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The national incidence of WNV neuroinvasive disease was 0.53 cases per 100,000 population (&lt;a id="T2_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#T2_down"&gt;Table 2&lt;/a&gt;). The highest WNV neuroinvasive disease incidences were in Colorado (5.38 per 100,000), South Dakota (5.00), and Nebraska (4.60) (&lt;a id="F1_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#F1_down"&gt;Figure&lt;/a&gt;); these states also had the highest incidence of total cases.** The largest numbers of WNV neuroinvasive disease cases were reported from California (334), Colorado (316), and Texas (122), accounting for 43% of neuroinvasive disease cases nationwide. WNV neuroinvasive disease incidence increased with age from 0.02 per 100,000 among persons aged &amp;lt;10 years to 1.56 per 100,000 among those aged ≥70 years. Incidence of WNV neuroinvasive disease was higher among males (0.68 per 100,000) than among females (0.38).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Powassan Virus Disease&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty-nine cases of Powassan virus disease were reported from 11 states, representing the highest number of cases reported to ArboNET since 2004 when Powassan was added as a separate reportable disease condition. Illness onset for 96% of cases occurred during April–December, with cases evenly distributed across this period (Table 1). Two patients, both in New England, experienced illness onset in December. Maryland reported its first Powassan virus disease case in a resident who contracted the virus in Canada.&lt;sup&gt;††&lt;/sup&gt; Median patient age was 68 years (IQR = 58–72 years), and 65% were male. Forty-seven (96%) patients had neuroinvasive disease, 44 (90%) were hospitalized, and eight (16%) died. The median age of patients who died was 71 years (IQR = 67–78 years). States with the highest Powassan virus neuroinvasive disease incidence were Maine (0.50 per 100,000), New Hampshire (0.29), and Vermont (0.15) (Table 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;La Crosse Virus Disease&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty-five cases of La Crosse virus disease were reported from 10 states. Twenty-seven (77%) patients had illness onset during July–September (Table 1), and, similar to past years, 60% of patients were male, and most patients (91%) were aged &amp;lt;18 years. Thirty-four (97%) patients had neuroinvasive disease. All 35 patients were hospitalized; none died. Ohio reported the highest number of neuroinvasive La Crosse virus disease cases (12; 35%) (Table 2). States with the highest neuroinvasive La Crosse virus disease incidence were West Virginia (0.28 per 100,000), Ohio (0.10), and Tennessee (0.07).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Jamestown Canyon Virus Disease&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-seven cases of Jamestown Canyon virus disease were reported from seven states. In 85% of cases, illness onset occurred during April–September (Table 1). Median patient age was 60 years, and 74% of patients were male. Twenty (74%) patients had neuroinvasive disease, 25 (93%) were hospitalized, and three (11%) died. The highest incidences of neuroinvasive disease were reported from Wisconsin (0.19 per 100,000), Michigan (0.05), and Minnesota (0.03) (Table 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;St. Louis Encephalitis Virus Disease&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-one cases of St. Louis encephalitis virus disease were reported from three states, including the first-ever human disease case reported from South Carolina. Illness onset occurred during July–September in 81% of cases (Table 1). Median patient age was 62 years and 67% were male. Fourteen (67%) patients had neuroinvasive disease, 17 (81%) were hospitalized, and two (10%) died. The highest incidence of St. Louis encephalitis virus neuroinvasive disease was reported in California (0.03 per 100,000) (Table 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus Disease&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven cases of eastern equine encephalitis virus disease were reported from four states in 2023, which is the same as the median number of cases reported during 2003–2022. Illness onset in five of the seven cases occurred during July–September; two cases occurred during April–June (Table 1). Median patient age was 64 years, and six of the seven patients were male. All seven patients had neuroinvasive disease and were hospitalized; one patient died.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the researchers also found that those who drank sodas loaded with saccharin had a 110 percent increased risk of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No link was found between type 2 diabetes and aspartame or sucralose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lyn M Steffen, an epidemiology professor at the University of Minnesota and study author&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The observational study did not determine the reason why artificial sweeteners may lead to type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also remains unclear how much of diet soda was being consumed by participants in each group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research has indicated that diet sodas are healthier alternatives to regular soda for diabetic patients as they cannot directly raise blood sugar levels since they have no regular sugar in them.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the researchers believe that consuming excessive diet sodas with artificial sweeteners that are overall much sweeter than real sugar may interfere with the body's metabolism process and lead to excess sugar in the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But this is not the first time saccharin has come under fire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2019 Medicina study found that long-term saccharin consumption increases the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, liver and renal impairment in rats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also lead to the development of brain cancer in rats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the American Heart Association, men should consume no more than 36 grams or 150 calories of sugar per day while women should consume no more than 25 grams or 100 calories of sugar per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Excess sugar consumption can pave the way for weight gain, high blood pressure, heart disease and insulin resistance, which can cause type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the condition and over 37 million American adults suffer from this form of the chronic illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC reports that over 100,000 Americans die of type 2 diabetes every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is caused by &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11238421/Even-SLIM-type-2-diabetics-reverse-condition.html"&gt;either the pancreas not producing enough insulin&lt;/a&gt; - a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels - or the body's cells not responding properly to insulin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When you eat sugar, your body breaks it down into glucose, which the enters your bloodstream for energy absorption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To regulate blood sugar levels, the pancreas releases insulin, which helps glucose enter your cells for energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But consuming excessive amounts of sugar can make the body resistant to insulin, meaning it can't effectively use the insulin to lower blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This leads to high blood sugar levels and a buildup of glucose in the bloodstream, which can damage the eyes, kidneys, nerves and heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the chronic illness cannot be permanently treated, patients are advised to regulate their blood sugar levels through medication, healthy eating, physical activity and stress management.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 16:50:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>为什么神秘的美国农村群体遭受国家最大杀手的可能性要低九倍-每日邮报 | Why mysterious group of rural Americans are NINE TIMES less likely to suffer from country's biggest killers -

One study estimated the rate of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-0d10e470-460f-11f0-b7db-dd878349baf6"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; among the Amish to be less than one percent compared to about 13 percent of the general population at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And a 2007 study projected that 10 percent of Amish women experience anxiety compared to 28 percent of the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The small communities are spread mostly throughout &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pennsylvania/index.html" id="mol-a0a84720-456d-11f0-b7db-dd878349baf6"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/ohio/index.html" id="mol-a0a82010-456d-11f0-b7db-dd878349baf6" class=""&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/indiana/index.html" id="mol-a0a70ea0-456d-11f0-b7db-dd878349baf6" class=""&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt; numbering around 400,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-11895705/Amish-teen-shares-glimpse-life-community-REALLY-like-embarks-Rumspringa.html"&gt;close-knit and removed&lt;/a&gt; from most of the toxins ubiquitous in everyday 21st century life, from processed foods to highway pollution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health researchers have long viewed Amish communities as isolated worlds - unique, self-contained populations that remain essentially unchanged after more than 300 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Amish communities live largely agrarian lives, with people from age 6 to 60 working in the fields, kitchens and homes without modern machines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They lead agrarian lifestyles, with everyone from children to elders working together in fields or small businesses, kitchens and homes, often without modern machinery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say this physically active, family-centered way of life fosters deep fulfillment, self worth and enduring mental and physical vitality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These qualities, which many argue have been eroded, protect the mind against depression and the brain against Alzheimer's disease, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tobacco use in Amish communities is up to 40 percent lower than in the general population, contributing to far fewer tobacco-related cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rates of cancers, including those linked to tobacco use, were shown in one 2010 study of Ohio Amish communities to be &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19779840/"&gt;40 percent lower&lt;/a&gt; than non-Amish Ohioans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;They are nine times less likely to be obese, which in turn lowers their risk of some of the country's biggest killers: cancer , heart disease and dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For religious reasons, alcohol consumption is also uncommon - in an Ohio Amish community, just 6 percent of men and under 2 percent of women reported drinking, compared to around 60 to 70 percent of average Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have also found some Amish people in Indiana possess a gene mutation that allows them&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://magazine.northwestern.edu/news/amish-fountain-of-youth-genetic-mutation-protects-some-amish-against-aging"&gt; to live 10 percent longer&lt;/a&gt;, keeps their blood vessels healthy, and insulin levels low. This mutation reduces levels of a protein called PAI-1, which plays a key role in aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Here's a breakdown of how the truly unplugged lifestyle contributes to good health, according to &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8857275/#R42"&gt;NIH-funded research&lt;/a&gt; and academic studies on Amish cultural and health norms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;They're constantly active&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every Amish community member between the ages of 6 and 60 is physically active from sunrise through sunset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Men and women in an Amish community in Aylmer, Ontario, get &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14707772/"&gt;between three and 10 hours&lt;/a&gt; of vigorous exercise a week and take around 14,000 to 18,000 steps daily - this doesn't drop off even as they get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Compared to children who are not Amish, Lancaster Amish children spend nearly an extra hour each day being active, especially through moderate to vigorous exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;They eat from their own land&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amish communities typically eat fresh, chemical-free foods that &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21317401/"&gt;come from their farms&lt;/a&gt; and gardens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Butter is &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22026912/"&gt;churned at home&lt;/a&gt;, bread is baked fresh every day, and vegetables are hand-harvested and eaten within four hours of being picked, which locks in more nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Caroline Brock, a sociologist focusing on Amish farming and food systems at the University of Missouri, told the Daily Mail that, 'In general, more [Amish people] on average would have a small garden with a handful of chickens, a cow.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amish families may not grow their own wheat (they buy their flour and other basic necessities), but 'they're eating more vegetables from their garden and they spend less money on food on average,' Dr. Brock said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Amish also tend to avoid sweeteners, only using a tablespoon of honey or maple syrup a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because they cultivate most of their food, Amish communities aren't exposed to the hidden added sugars, preservatives and food dyes in much of our processed foods. Their produce is also cultivated without the use of carcinogenic chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;By growing and storing  their own food, Amish communities avoid hidden sugars, preservatives and dyes found in store-bought foods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Fermented foods are a staple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amish families regularly eat fermented foods like sauerkraut, pickled vegetables and homemade yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many Amish families start meals with three tablespoons of fermented vegetables, which help support digestion and gut health by feeding good bacteria into the digestive system, according to the NIH study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A balanced gut microbiome has been linked to stronger immunity, better digestion and lower rates of chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Their biggest meal is at noon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amish meals are carefully timed to work with the body's natural circadian rhythms. The largest meal of the day takes place between 11:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m., when the sun is highest in the sky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to fueling a labor-intensive day, front-loading &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9605877/"&gt;calories early &lt;/a&gt;helps balance energy and digestion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Amish folks stick to traditional food prep methods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead of relying on processed, shelf-stable foods with harmful additives, Amish communities use canning, pickling and fermenting methods to store their fresh fruits, vegetables and meats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Canning locks in nutrients at their peak freshness and pickling preserves the food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While fermentation both preserves food and can enhance its nutritional value. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Amish life centers on close family, church and community ties that protect against depression and anxiety&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Amish families wake at dawn and turn in after sunset, naturally syncing with circadian rhythms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;No screen time &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Amish shun modern technological comforts,&lt;span&gt; navigating without Google Maps and communicating without social media.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Living without TVs, smartphones or computers means fewer hours are spent watching news alerts, seeing advertisements and scrolling social media, which can trigger feelings of anxiety and inadequacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Business owners in the community may share a phone with other families or with a non-Amish person, Dr. Brock said, but modern technology is not a daily presence in most Amish people's lives.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Numerous studies have shown excessive smartphone use has a deleterious effect on people's mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10587281/#Sec2"&gt;on Australian adults&lt;/a&gt; measured their phone usage based on a questionnaire that asked them to rate statements like, 'There are times when I would rather use the smartphone than deal with other more pressing issues.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who use their phones a little to a moderate amount had a lower average depression score of 12.1, while those with very high smartphone use had a score of 17.8 - higher scores indicate more severe symptoms of depression.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Minimal exposure to toxins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without cars, Amish people are exposed to less air pollution, and their reliance on homegrown foods means they avoid the synthetic chemicals, preservatives and additives in most grocery store items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Growing up on farms, Amish children are also exposed to a mix of natural microbes in soil, animals and fresh air, a factor researchers believe contributes to their low rates of asthma and allergies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/news-items/study-finds-amish-childrens-exposures-protect-against-asthma/"&gt;5 percent of Amish schoolchildren&lt;/a&gt; ages 6 to 14 have asthma, which is about half of the US average (10.3 percent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Tobacco and alcohol use is extremely rare &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some Amish men use tobacco, its use overall is far less prevalent compared to non-Amish communities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2009 study of Amish people living in Ohio found that community members &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10552-009-9435-7"&gt;had a 37&lt;/a&gt; percent lower rate of tobacco-related cancers compared to other adults in the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drinking alcohol is also rare in Amish communities.

Why do these youngsters develop &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/atopic-eczema/"&gt;atopic eczema&lt;/a&gt; when their friends do not – especially if they share similar environments?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research team has been looking into whether a child’s genetic profile influences the risk of eczema. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After reviewing a set of data involving children from several countries, the experts uncovered hints that a household &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/national-puppy-day-2025-where-happiness-meets-responsibility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt; might help offset some of the genetic factors behind itchy skin irritation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Sara Brown from the University of Edinburgh’s &lt;a href="http://The%20Institute%20of%20Genetics%20and%20Cancer%20%20%20https://g.co/kgs/DQMJEzs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Institute of Genetics and Cancer&lt;/a&gt; and Dr. Marie Standl from &lt;a href="https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Helmholtz Munich&lt;/a&gt; contributed to this work and brought fresh insight into how these influences might unfold for families everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-eczema-in-children"&gt;Understanding eczema in children&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eczema involves red, inflamed patches that can be difficult to soothe. This condition arises from a blend of inherited makeup and influences such as early-life bacterial contact or exposure to specific animals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a family history of dry skin issues does not guarantee a child will develop it, but it raises the odds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have wondered why certain kids with a genetic variant live free of symptoms while others encounter a lifetime of creams and lotions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db460.htm#Key_finding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; note that 7.3% of adults aged 18 and over have eczema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have long suspected that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/are-dogs-replacing-children-how-modern-society-is-changing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dogs&lt;/a&gt; might play a protective part for some children, and this new investigation adds support to that theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dogs-may-protect-children-from-eczema"&gt;Dogs may protect children from eczema&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families with a pet dog often report that their kids seem to have fewer episodes of skin flare-ups. The researchers wanted to see if this pattern held up at a molecular level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They focused on a segment of DNA near the interleukin-7 receptor (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17660817/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IL-7R&lt;/a&gt;), which helps the body regulate immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that genetic make-up affects a child’s risk of developing eczema and previous studies have shown that owning a pet dog may be protective,” said Professor Brown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One part of the study found that children with a slight twist in that gene could sidestep the usual risk for eczema if they had a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/why-our-relationships-with-dogs-matter-so-much/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt; in their household early in life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-siblings-might-help-reduce-eczema-risk"&gt;Siblings might help reduce eczema risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have also noticed that having older brothers or sisters might offer some protection. Observations point to a possible link between exposure to unique bacteria from siblings and a child’s reaction to environmental triggers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research is needed to confirm how varied bacterial environments influence the genetic component of eczema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not every preventive measure works for everyone, and that’s precisely why gene-environment studies are crucial,” said Dr. Standl. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families sometimes consider adding a second child or adopting a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dogs-suffer-from-the-january-blues-just-like-humans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt; to reduce eczema risk. Not every measure works for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dogs-don-t-work-for-every-eczema-case"&gt;Dogs don’t work for every eczema case&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists emphasize that having a dog from day one does not guarantee eczema-free skin. The recent work did not examine the effects of dogs on treating existing cases of eczema. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many professionals caution that introducing an animal might irritate symptoms that are already present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that contact with dog-related bacteria might shape a child’s immune response in ways that shift how that interleukin-7 receptor behaves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though this gene variation is not the only cause of eczema, it appears to be important in controlling inflammation. Early-life dog exposure could modify that gene’s effect so the skin’s defensive barriers stay in better shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-diversity-in-research-matters"&gt;Why diversity in research matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest findings draw primarily from white European participants, prompting calls for more studies in other populations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eczema affects millions of people &lt;a href="https://nationaleczema.org/eczema-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;worldwide&lt;/a&gt;, including groups with differing genetic backgrounds. A broader pool of participants will help clarify how these discoveries apply to families everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents often wonder if a dog in the home might lower the odds of their child facing red, itchy skin every night. These early results support the idea that dog ownership might help in specific genetic situations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More data from a wider range of people will show whether the same pattern exists in other populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eczema-genetics-and-the-future"&gt;Eczema, genetics, and the future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts continue exploring the interplay between genetic traits and outside factors to better understand why some children develop eczema. They aim to refine the science so parents have straightforward answers about potential lifestyle steps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future work may also investigate whether other pets or environmental exposures shape this immune balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study team believes that continuing to map the roles of various gene variants could open the door to targeted prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents can stay alert to new findings on additional ways to keep a child’s skin barrier strong. They may also want to consult a pediatrician before making major decisions, especially if a youngster already struggles with chronic irritation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/all.16605" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Allergy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol may impair cellular functions essential to maintaining brain blood vessel health, according to researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder. Findings suggest that erythritol increases oxidative stress, disrupts nitric oxide signaling, raises vasoconstrictive peptide production, and diminishes clot-dissolving capacity in human brain microvascular endothelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Erythritol has become a fixture in the ingredient lists of protein bars, low-calorie beverages, and diabetic-friendly baked goods. Its appeal lies in its sweetness-to-calorie ratio, roughly 60–80% as sweet as sucrose with a tiny fraction of the energy yield, and its negligible effect on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+glucose/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood glucose&lt;/a&gt;. Erythritol is also synthesized endogenously from glucose and fructose via the pentose phosphate pathway, leaving baseline levels subject to both dietary and metabolic influences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns about erythritol's safety have escalated following epidemiological studies linking higher plasma concentrations with increased cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Positive associations between circulating erythritol and incidence of heart attack and stroke have been observed in U.S. and European cohorts, independent of known cardiometabolic risk factors. A causal mechanism for the link has remained elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "The Non-Nutritive Sweetener Erythritol Adversely Affects Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cell Function," &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/i&gt;, researchers designed in vitro experiments to test the cellular consequences of erythritol exposure on cerebral endothelial function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells were cultured and exposed to an amount of erythritol equivalent to consuming a typical beverage. Experimental conditions included five biological replicates per group.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Cellular assays measured &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/oxidative+stress/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt;, antioxidant protein expression, nitric oxide bioavailability, endothelin production, and fibrinolytic capacity. Capillary electrophoresis immunoassay and ELISA were used to quantify expression of superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1), catalase, endothelial &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/nitric+oxide/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;nitric oxide&lt;/a&gt; synthase (eNOS), phosphorylated eNOS, endothelin-1 (ET-1), and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cells exposed to erythritol exhibited a substantial increase in oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species levels rose by approximately 75% relative to untreated controls. Antioxidant defense markers were also elevated, with SOD-1 expression increasing by approximately 45% and catalase by approximately 25%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitric oxide production declined by nearly 20% in response to erythritol. Although total eNOS expression remained unchanged, phosphorylation at the Ser1177 site, which is associated with enzymatic activation, fell by approximately 33%. In contrast, phosphorylation at the inhibitory Thr495 site increased by approximately 39%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another test, t-PA release in response to thrombin stimulation was blunted in erythritol-treated cells, indicating reduced fibrinolytic responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers conclude that erythritol exposure disrupts multiple mechanisms vital to maintaining cerebral endothelial health. Although results are limited to acute in vitro conditions, the findings align with prior epidemiological associations between erythritol and elevated stroke risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors recommend further investigation using long-term and in vivo models, citing the need for clinical studies to clarify whether repeated dietary exposure to erythritol carries cerebrovascular consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

I've witnessed the benefits that a reliable CGM can have on my health thanks to Abbott's Lingo, &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-otc-glucose-monitor-encouraged-me-to-change-my-eating-habits-heres-how/"&gt;which I tested&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-otc-glucose-monitor-encouraged-me-to-change-my-eating-habits-heres-how/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This OTC glucose monitor encouraged me to change my eating habits - here's how&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, when Dexcom sent me its &lt;span class="c-commerceLink"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stelo-Biosensor-Continuous-Monitoring-Personalized/dp/B0DTZ616WZ?tag=zdnet-buy-button-20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" data-aps-asin="B0DTZ616WZ" data-aps-asc-tag="zd-buy-button-20" data-aps-asc-subtag="__COM_CLICK_ID__|null|dtp"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stelo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the first over-the-counter CGM to hit the market last year, I was eager to see what it could do for my health and compare it to the Abbott Lingo. &lt;a href="https://www.stelo.com/en-us/how-it-works" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" class="c-regularLink"&gt;According to Dexcom&lt;/a&gt;, the Stelo has a 93% accuracy rate, so I compared the Stelo's results against a traditional finger-stick monitor during my two-week testing period. Here's how it went.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Applying the sensor&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you can begin tracking, you'll need to apply the sensor. The app provides step-by-step instructions, and you essentially stamp it onto the back of your arm, about three inches away from any injection sites, and in an area with enough fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Stelo utilizes a button to trigger the sensor's application, deploying a flexible needle. I felt some adrenaline and heat in the area, but these sensations disappeared after a few minutes. This was the worst part of the process. The needle didn't feel like a traditional shot from the doctor's office, but more like getting your ears pierced with a piercing gun. Plus, Stelo's sensor is a bit smaller than Lingo's, so I thought it was a more convenient fit on the back of my arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-a-49-otc-continuous-glucose-monitor-for-two-weeks-heres-what-i-learned/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I tested a $49 OTC continuous glucose monitor for two weeks - here's what I learned&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After applying, it asks you a few personal questions, and from there, gives you a target range of glucose. Mine was 70-140, which means that having a 70 might be your resting rate, while after eating, it should move up to the &amp;gt;140 to reflect food intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-color-black"&gt;&lt;div class="c-ShortcodeContent"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A close-up of the Stelo on the back of my arm. The adhesive gets very dirty, very easily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall u-block"&gt;Allison Jewell/ZDNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this sensor, you wait about 20 minutes to receive active readings. Then, the process begins as you log food, stress, and exercise for 15 days. The app's AI software then takes the data from your readings and events or meals you logged to give you insights on stabilizing your glucose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/one-of-the-best-smart-rings-ive-tested-beats-out-the-oura-3-and-ultrahuman/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the best smart rings I've tested beats out the Oura 3 and Ultrahuman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gen AI software uses Google Cloud's &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-updates-gemini-and-gemma-on-vertex-ai-and-gives-imagen-a-text-to-live-image-generator/"&gt;Vertex AI&lt;/a&gt; platform to personalize the Stelo experience. For now, the AI only provides weekly insights from the information collected by the sensor, as well as the food, events, and stress you log. It is in the beginning stages, so Dexcom is still developing the technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Spike alerts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My last trial using Abbott's Lingo CGM helped me tackle broader eating habits. For instance, it helped me reintroduce breakfast into my life, prioritize protein, and gave me a glimpse into how stress affects my body's glucose from Lingo's weekly insights in tandem with playing detective to figure out what food worked best with my body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also: &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-used-oura-rings-new-cgm-integration-to-track-my-glucose-heres-what-i-learned/"&gt;I used Oura Ring's new CGM integration to track my glucose for a few weeks. Here's what I learned&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the Lingo, the Stelo showed me how much stress can affect glucose and, in turn, the rest of your body. Driving and playing video games with my friends seemed to drive up my glucose the most. A casual game of Fortnite with my friends caused a spike and crash, helping me realize I need to control my mental state in those stressful situations and supplement my body with ample nutrients, such as vegetables, healthy fats, and protein instead of high-sugar carbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paying close attention to which carbs affected my body the most also played a significant role in my experience with the Stelo. Diet isn't all-or-nothing, I learned. A few of your favorite high-sugar foods or snacks once in a while aren't going to hurt you, especially if you pair them with activity or nutrient-dense foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can do this not only by watching your glucose in real time but also by reading the app's education. I appreciated the app's spike alerts, which helped me avoid constantly checking my glucose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-smartwatch/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best smartwatches you can buy: Expert tested&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also connect your data with your healthcare provider for an informed opinion. Your provider has a certain code for their clinic, which you can enter in the Stelo app. Once pasted, your data is automatically streamed to your provider through Dexcom's Clarity software. You can also request a hard copy of your data from your provider, but not through the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What I'd like to see with the next model&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-color-black"&gt;&lt;div class="c-ShortcodeContent"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a screenshot of a 24-hour period of data. The app allows you to look at data on certain days back months, which is handy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall u-block"&gt;Screenshot by Allison Jewell/ZDNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I learned how vital exercise -- even a small burst in the middle of the day or after a big meal -- is to stabilize glucose. Even if it's just a 15-minute walk each day, I could see the effects through the app's data. When I started the sensor, my average glucose was in the 60s, just under the target resting range of 70. While it's not unhealthy, I could feel the physical effects of lower blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-expert-backed-tips-to-get-better-sleep-especially-if-you-own-a-health-tracking-wearable/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 expert-backed tips to get better sleep -especially if you own a health-tracking wearable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After I completed the next week of meal and stress logging, the app finally suggested adding a small amount of exercise to stabilize my glucose stream. The next week, I began to walk 15 minutes before work and 15 minutes after dinner. I slowly saw my glucose average rise to the 70-80 range pre-meal and had steady inclines after meals, with minimal spikes and crashes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, my birthday weekend came, and my consumption of birthday cake, alcohol, and hot chicken without exercise reset all of my progress as I started to get more spike and crash alerts, and could literally see it on the graph compared to when I was mindfully eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How accurate is the Stelo?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While researching the Stelo, I saw some Reddit posts reporting inaccurate readings compared to other readers. As it is the first iteration of the product, there are bound to be certain inaccuracies. However, there are many reasons why your Stelo CGM reading might not match up to a standard finger-prick monitor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one, when comparing your Stelo readings to a conventional finger-pricking monitor, you have to factor in a 20% margin of error. This is because Stelo reads the glucose levels from your interstitial fluid, while the finger-prick monitor measures glucose from your blood. Naturally, your interstitial fluid lags behind your blood in terms of glucose levels. It especially lags when you eat a carb or sugar-heavy meal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also: &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-my-health-tracker/"&gt;How I learned to stop worrying and love my health tracker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, most glucose monitors on the market have a healthy margin of error. This is because pinpoint accuracy can be affected by external factors like temperature, user error, interference with test strips, and more. Ultimately, most glucose monitors have a 10% margin of error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the two weeks, I compared my readings to a traditional finger-prick monitor. I recorded my glucose when I woke up, after my first meal, and then after dinner. Altogether, I found that the Stelo monitor rarely dipped below or above the 20% margin. If anything, my finger-prick monitor had more inaccurate one-off readings. Below are just a few of my compared readings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="547e0987-8c78-40d8-adad-be65eb7637a1" class="c-shortcodeListicle g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium"&gt; &lt;div class="c-shortcodeListicle_conten"&gt;  &lt;div class="c-shortcodeListicle_dek"&gt;&lt;div class="c-ShortcodeContent"&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stelo reading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finger-prick reading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morning pre food 4/30&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;83&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;89&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After lunch 4/30&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;96&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;95&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After dinner 4/30&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;93&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;120&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morning pre food 5/1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;89&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;82&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After lunch 5/1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;72&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;81&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After dinner 5/1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;114&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;133&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morning pre food 5/2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;80&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;92&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After lunch 5/2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;88&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;85&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After dinner 5/2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;93&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;88&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a data-cy="infoCard_showMore" class="c-shortcodeInfocard-faq-showMore"&gt;

      &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were quite a few instances where I ate a carb-heavy dinner and saw the CGM lag behind the finger-prick monitor. Still, the Stelo's readings were just a few points off, showing that the Stelo is quite accurate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I would assess my monitor as accurate and, in some cases, reflecting my glucose's lag in migration from my blood to my interstitial fluid. If you're worried about the accuracy of your CGM, I suggest considering margin error, glucose's travel path, and other external factors while wearing the Stelo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Minimal first iteration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The over-patch used to secure the device to my arm became dirty very easily. After a few days, I experienced sharp pain from my first sensor, so I removed it. The new sensor I applied did not cause that issue. I also had a defunct CGM during my second round with the product, even after applying it and waiting 24 hours to see if it would ever turn on. I eventually gave up and put on the other one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-color-black"&gt;&lt;div class="c-ShortcodeContent"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Stelo landing page, which is very simple to navigate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall u-block"&gt;Allison Jewell/ZDNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the functions of this first iteration are minimal&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; like the Lingo, the Stelo has lots of potential for future iterations -- especially with the AI coaching and &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-used-oura-rings-new-cgm-integration-to-track-my-glucose-heres-what-i-learned/"&gt;its collaboration with Oura&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Stelo and Lingo utilize generative AI software, which provides personalized insights and guidance for each individual's needs. But that's it, the AI features end there. Dexcom has big plans to implement more AI-powered features on the device, like a possible new AI function that allows you to take a picture of your food and receive its nutrient information. This feature could be game-changing for dieting apps, as logging food so specifically can be tedious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best Apple Watch you can buy: Expert tested&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Stelo's generative AI feature sound enticing, Dexcom must expand it to provide users with consistent, comprehensive, and beneficial advice. It took a week to receive a suggestion from my weekly insights about adding exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone who had previously used a CGM, I knew what to work on. However, someone who only has a sensor for a month may not have enough time to fully understand their metabolism. I would love to see more suggestions and tweaks from the software, such as daily insights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;ZDNET's buying advice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="c-commerceLink"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stelo-Biosensor-Continuous-Monitoring-Personalized/dp/B0DTZ616WZ?tag=zdnet-buy-button-20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" data-aps-asin="B0DTZ616WZ" data-aps-asc-tag="zd-buy-button-20" data-aps-asc-subtag="__COM_CLICK_ID__|null|dtp"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stelo by Dexcom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; retails for $99 for two 30-day sensors. This device offers an easy-to-use interface to help people make better choices about managing their glucose levels. This device could be very beneficial for those who struggle with obesity, prediabetes, or Type 2 diabetes (not on insulin). Preventing metabolic diseases like Type 2 diabetes takes lots of effort, education, and time, which is why Stelo could be a useful tool. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even hard-core athletes could benefit from this technology to maximize their performance as biologically possible. The Stelo could help give people control over their bodies, with the caveat that it will cost $99 per month. I recommend the Stelo over the Lingo if you prefer a smaller sensor, a quicker way to log events, and a more straightforward process for monitoring your glucose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ZDNET</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 14:18:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiygFBVV95cUxQdzFiMUttcW1sVmNGV002TVVraXY3WlctQngzZk8tUy1lZ0hDVWhKamNzclBLRzExb2VQS2xoYmtZeUhlYU9LUzRqMlJwa0ZKRzBxY1ZZbGlwMzl1Wm01MlVSMHE0a0l0Mjg4NHpHMk8tS3lSV1NNdjNwTDN3Rmw5ZzNhU1R3aEJpQlMyd1VYT0hQNkZkYU1ZdjJCSlhKeUszU0o0OXdVaWE3UWFlQ1BvRjlGN2VRcEpKMFVNTjE3dVlwUk50UWdTVzVR</guid></item><item><title>肌酸会损害您的肾脏吗？神话、事实以及您需要注意的事项-印度时报 | Can creatine damage your kidneys?

It’s like the OG of workout supplements—helping with strength, muscle growth, and even brain power. But there’s always been that one lingering worry: Can creatine mess with your kidneys?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short answer? For most healthy people— it’s totally safe. But, like with anything, there’s some nuance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is creatine?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your body actually makes creatine on its own. It’s made in liver, kidneys, and pancreas, and gets stored in your muscles. When you do quick, explosive stuff like sprinting or lifting weights, your muscles use creatine for fast energy. Supplements (usually creatine monohydrate) just bump up those reserves so you can go harder and recover quicker. That’s why athletes and gym bros love it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the research say?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at some key studies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kreider et al. (2017) did a massive review of creatine’s safety and found no evidence that creatine harms &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28615996/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;kidney &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;function in healthy individuals, even with long-term use (up to 5 years in some studies). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2011 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20976468/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;by Gualano et al., healthy adults took creatine for 21 months with no changes in kidney markers or function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They concluded it’s safe for long-term use in healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2004 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12850845_Long-term_oral_creatine_supplementation_does_not_impair_renal_function_in_healthy_athletes" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Poortmans &amp;amp; Francaux) also showed no negative kidney effects after 5 years of daily creatine in athletes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your kidneys start out healthy, creatine itself doesn’t seem to cause damage or disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;But who shouldn’t go all in without thinking?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s not pretend it’s magic dust for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already have kidney issues? Creatine could be a bit of a red flag. Your kidneys filter creatinine (a byproduct of creatine), so if they’re already not at their best, adding extra strain isn’t ideal. Always talk to your doc before starting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overdoing it? The sweet spot is around 3–5 grams per day (after a loading phase if you’re doing one). Mega-dosing, stacking it with other random supplements, or not following instructions? That’s a no-go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not drinking enough water? Creatine pulls water into your muscles. If you’re not hydrating properly, it could put pressure on your kidneys—especially during sweaty workouts. Water is your best friend here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Want to play it safe? Here’s your game plan:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get a kidney function test before you start, especially if you’re over 40 or have health issues like diabetes or high BP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stick to the recommended dose—3 to 5 grams per day. That’s enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydrate like it’s your job, especially before and after workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice anything weird—like swelling, peeing less, or feeling drained for no reason? Don’t ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t mix creatine with meds or other stuff that stresses your kidneys (like NSAIDs) unless your doc gives you the green light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So, is creatine safe?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most healthy folks—yes. Creatine is one of the most researched supplements out there, and there’s no solid proof that it causes &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-creatine/art-20347591#:~:text=While%20taking%20creatine%20might%20not,kidney%20function%20in%20healthy%20people." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;kidney &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;damage in people with normal kidney function.

              &lt;p&gt;When you think of longevity in animals, chances are that the &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-400-year-old-shark-may-hold-the-cure-to-aging-1785144189"&gt;Greenland shark&lt;/a&gt; will immediately come up. After all, researchers &lt;a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/greenland-shark.html"&gt;estimate&lt;/a&gt; that the enigmatic animal can live for &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; 250 years. It turns out, however, that bats also hold their own when it comes to lifespan, with some species living up to 25 years—equivalent to 180 human years—and they tend to do it cancer-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Rochester (UR) have investigated anti-cancer “superpowers,” as described in a UR &lt;a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/why-dont-bats-get-cancer"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, in four bat species: the little brown bat, the big brown bat, the cave nectar bat, and the Jamaican fruit bat. The results of their investigation could have important implications for treating cancer in humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Longer lifespans with more cell divisions, and longer exposure to exo- [external] and endogenous [internal] stressors increase cancer incidence,” the researchers wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59403-z"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published last month in the journal Nature Communications. “However, despite their exceptional lifespans, few to no tumors have been reported in long-lived wild and captive populations of bats.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Led by biologists Vera Gorbunova and Andrei Seluanov from the UR Department of Biology and Wilmot Cancer Institute, the team identified a number of biological defenses that help bats avoid the disease. For example, bats have a tumor-suppressor gene, called p53. Specifically, little brown bats carry two copies of the gene, and have high p53 activity, which can get rid of cancer cells during &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/apoptosis#:~:text=Apoptosis%20is%20the%20process%20of,a%20role%20in%20preventing%20cancer."&gt;apoptosis,&lt;/a&gt; a biological process that eliminates unwanted cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We hypothesize that some bat species have evolved enhanced p53 activity as an additional anti-cancer strategy, similar to elephants,” the researchers explained. Too much p53, though, runs the risk of killing too many cells. Clearly, bats are able to find the right apoptosis balance. Humans also have p53, but mutations in the gene—which disrupt its anti-cancer properties—exist in around 50% of human cancers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers also analyzed the enzyme telomerase. In bats, the telomerase expression allows bat cells to multiply endlessly. That means they don’t undergo replicative senescence: a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959804996000585"&gt;feature&lt;/a&gt; that restricts cell proliferation to a certain number of divisions. Since, according to the study, senescence “promotes age-related inflammation contributing to the aging process,” bats’ lack thereof would seem to promote longevity. And while indefinite cell proliferation might sound like the perfect cancer hotbed, bats’ high p53 activity can kill off any cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, “bats have unique immune systems which allows them to survive a wide range of deadly viruses, and many unique immune adaptations have been described in bats,” the researchers wrote. “Most knowledge of the bat immune systems comes from studies of bat tolerance to viral infections deadly to humans. However, these or similar immune adaptations may also recognize and eliminate tumors,” as well as “temper inflammation, which may have an anticancer effect.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cells have to go through several steps, or “oncogenic hits,” to become harmful cancerous cells. Surprisingly, the researchers also found that it only takes two hits for normal bat cells to become malignant, meaning bats aren’t naturally resistant to cancer—they just have “robust tumor-suppressor mechanisms,” as described in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings carry important implications for treating cancer. Specifically, the study confirms that increased p53 activity—which is already targeted by some anti-cancer drugs—can eliminate or slow cancer growth. More broadly, their research is yet another example of scientists turning to nature for solutions to human &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-tiny-robot-is-part-bee-part-crane-fly-and-it-finally-has-solid-legs-2000591586"&gt;challenges on all scales&lt;/a&gt;. Though the study focuses on bats, the ultimate aim is, always, finding a cure for cancer in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

It is rare in the US, with fewer than 50 cases reported yearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But now two cases have been confirmed in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nevada/index.html" id="mol-e615fe80-478c-11f0-9059-3f9404b37664"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt; - bringing the US' total count to 864 cases since 1993.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health experts are warning the public to be extra vigilant as warmer weather arrives, especially around areas such as sheds, barns, trailers, garages, and cabins where deer mice may have nested in the cold weather and left droppings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early symptoms of hantavirus include fever, fatigue and muscle aches, and may later progress to headaches, chills, and nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hantavirus can also cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), with patients often experiencing a tightness in the chest, as the lungs fill with fluid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HPS can be deadly and 38 percent of people who develop respiratory symptoms die from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts are sounding the alarm over the spread of a virus seldom seen in the US that comes from mice - the same virus that killed actor Gene Hackman 's wife - after two more cases have come to light &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Betsy Arakawa was found dead in the Santa Fe home she shared with her husband, Gene Hackman, and the mysterious circumstances surrounding their passing gripped the nation's attention for weeks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Melissa Bullock, Nevada State Medical Epidemiologist, told local 2 News Nevada: 'We urge people to be aware of any signs of rodent activity and to take precautions to reduce the risk of exposure to hantavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Anyone who has been in contact with rodents, nests or droppings and subsequently develops symptoms consistent with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome should see a health care provider immediately.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No details are known about the two people who have tested positive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To reduce risk of exposure, state health officials recommend airing out spaces where mice droppings could be, avoid sweeping droppings, use disinfectant and wipe up debris, and wear gloves and a mask. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hantaviruses are a group of viruses found worldwide that are &lt;span&gt;spread to people when they inhale aerosolized fecal matter, urine, or saliva from infected rodents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rarity of hantavirus in the US is partly because the country has fewer rodent species that the illness can circulate amongst, compared to Asia and Europe, where multiple rodent species act as hosts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/virginia/index.html" id="mol-84933260-478f-11f0-b334-8beb2a687d4a" class=""&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; Tech researchers found that while deer mice are still the primary reservoir for hantaviruses in North America, the virus is now circulating more widely than previously thought, with antibodies detected in six additional rodent species where they had not been documented before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Virginia Tech team &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.vt.edu/articles/2025/04/hantavirus-environmental-factors-influence-distribution-paanwaris-paansri-luis-escobar.html"&gt;analyzed data&lt;/a&gt; from the National Science Foundation's National Ecological Observatory Network to better understand how hantavirus spreads in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 2014 and 2019, the program gathered and tested 14,004 blood samples from 49 different mouse species at 45 locations across the US to test for levels of hantavirus antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seventy-nine percent of positive blood samples came from deer mice species, which cause around 90 percent of all hantavirus cases in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Debbie Zipperian, from Montana, survived Hantavirus after being diagnosed with the disease at 46. The former cowgirl told the Daily Mail how it upended her life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows hantavirus cases recorded in the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, researchers found that other rodent species had a higher percentage of hantavirus infections than deer mice – between 4.3 and five percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vast majority of human cases are traced back to two or three key deer mouse species, but the study's &lt;span&gt;findings reveal that the virus is more flexible than scientists once thought, broadening what they know about its basic biology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Virginia had the highest infection rate among rodents, with nearly eight percent of samples testing positive for hantavirus – four times the national average of around two percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorado had the second-highest infection rate, followed by Texas, both known risk regions for the virus, with average positive blood samples more than twice as high as the national average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team's findings could influence how public health officials monitor and evaluate hantavirus risk and help clarify human cases in areas where the usual rodent host is uncommon or missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Paansri said: 'This new information is expected to help us understand where and when hantavirus is most likely to occur, which is crucial for predicting outbreaks and informing public health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We believe that many lessons learned from this study can be generalized to other wildlife diseases, considering that their distribution is global.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 13:46:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item></channel></rss>
