                                        &lt;p&gt;MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) — A person living in New York has tested positive for the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/china-mosquitoes-chikungunya-explainer-050e53750c8c041fc72b7cf62c01b92f"&gt;chikungunya virus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in what state health officials say is the first reported transmission of the mosquito-borne illness within the United States in six years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state Department of Health said Tuesday that the virus, which has been &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/china-chikungunya-virus-outbreak-control-measures-3ee97c21152b05ed0912af646594eafd"&gt;spreading in China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and elsewhere, was identified in a person living in Nassau County on Long Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The county’s health department, in a separate statement, said the person began experiencing symptoms in August after having traveled outside of the region, but not out of the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear how exactly the person, whom authorities have not named, contracted the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say the person was likely bit by an infected mosquito, but they also say the virus has not been detected in local mosquito pools and there is no evidence of ongoing transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The type of mosquito known to carry chikungunya is present in parts of the New York City metropolitan area, including suburban Long Island. The disease cannot be spread directly from one person to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since mosquitoes are less active during the fall’s cooler temperatures, the current risk of transmission is “very low,” said state Health Commissioner James McDonald.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chikungunya is found mostly in tropical and subtropical regions, according to the state health department. Its symptoms include fever and joint pain, headache, muscle pain, joint swelling and rashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The illness is rarely fatal and most patients recover within a week, though newborns, older adults and people with chronic health conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes are at higher risk, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and its territories have not seen a locally acquired case of the virus since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York state has had three other cases of the virus this year, though all were linked to international travel to regions where the virus is prevalent, state health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local mosquitoes can transmit other dangerous viruses, such as West Nile, Eastern Equine Encephalitis and Jamestown Canyon viruses.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A student found the duck earlier in the week, according to the Hawaii Department of Health. Laboratory testing confirmed the duck carried the H5 subtype of influenza A virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confirmation of avian influenza, or H5N1, is pending from the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Iowa, in the next week or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time, officials said, the risk of infection to humans is considered low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Human infections remain rare and are primarily linked to direct animal exposure,” said health officials in the release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/disease_listing/avian-influenza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Avian influenza&lt;/a&gt; has been circulating worldwide, and is highly infectious among wild birds and poultry, with outbreaks on the U.S. continent affecting hundreds of dairy cattle herds in 18 states, including California.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza, so far, has been limited in Hawaii, which has had no human cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawaii’s first outbreak of avian influenza was &lt;a href="https://808ne.ws/3V1duhd" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;confirmed at Susie’s duck sanctuary &lt;/a&gt;in Wahiawa last November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hawaii Department of Agriculture &amp;amp; Biosecurity confirmed that at least 10 birds on the property, including ducks, geese, and a wild zebra dove, died from avian influenza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 70 waterfowl, including some ducks adopted by a family at Pearl Harbor, either died or were euthanized in relation to that outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last November, officials also confirmed avian influenza in a &lt;a href="https://808ne.ws/3WCxRBP" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;wild duck&lt;/a&gt; tested at James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge in Kahuku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That duck showed no signs of infection when tested, and was swabbed and released by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service during an ongoing project on genetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, no new avian influenza detections had been reported in the Hawaiian islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH, DAB, and the state Department of Land and Natural Resources are monitoring health reports, poultry farms and wild bird populations for any signs the virus has spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The student had reported the sick duck to the Hawaii Wildlife Center, a nonprofit that saves and rehabilitates wild birds, including seabirds disoriented by artificial lights during fallout season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fallout season began in mid-September and lasts through mid-December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”As Hawaiʻi enters migratory bird season, this latest case is a reminder that wild birds may carry diseases to the islands and the public should remain vigilant,” said officials in the release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials remind anyone who encounters sick or dead birds to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Avoid touching or handling wild birds, especially waterfowl or shorebirds. Upon finding a wild bird, follow &lt;a href="https://808ne.ws/4om9aFH" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;these instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Report multiple or unusual illnesses in poultry, livestock, or other wild birds to the DAB Animal Industry Division at 808-483-7100, Monday to Friday from 7:45 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., 808-837-8092 during non-business hours and holidays; or via email at &lt;a href="mailto:dabic@hawaii.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;dabic@hawaii.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the night, the world can sometimes feel like a dark place. Under the cover of darkness, negative thoughts have a way of drifting through your mind, and as you lie awake, staring at the ceiling, you might start craving guilty pleasures, like a cigarette or a carb-heavy meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plenty of evidence suggests the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-020-00879-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;human mind functions differently&lt;/a&gt; if awake at nighttime. Past midnight, negative emotions tend to draw our attention more than positive ones, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smrv.2015.10.003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;dangerous ideas grow&lt;/a&gt; in appeal, and inhibitions fall away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some researchers think the human &lt;a href="https://www.nigms.nih.gov/education/fact-sheets/Pages/circadian-rhythms.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt; is heavily involved in these critical changes in function, as they outline in a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnetp.2021.830338/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;2022 paper&lt;/a&gt; summarizing the evidence of how brain systems function differently after dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/there-are-5-profiles-of-sleep-heres-what-yours-says-about-your-health"&gt;There Are 5 Profiles of Sleep – Here's What Yours Says About Your Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their hypothesis, called 'Mind After Midnight', suggests the human body and the human mind follow a natural 24-hour cycle of activity that influences our emotions and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, at certain hours, our species is inclined to feel and act in certain ways. In the daytime, for instance, molecular levels and brain activity are tuned to wakefulness. But at night, our usual behavior is put to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141228" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141228" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/AlarmClockWithPersonSleepingInBackgroundBlurry_R_U_642.jpg" alt="An alarm clock in the foreground with a blurred person in bed " class="size-full wp-image-141228" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/AlarmClockWithPersonSleepingInBackgroundBlurry_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/AlarmClockWithPersonSleepingInBackgroundBlurry_R_U_642-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141228" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Our species is inclined to sleep at night. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADEbULOUn4/"&gt;Motortion/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;From an evolutionary standpoint, this, of course, makes sense. Humans are much more effective at hunting and gathering in the daylight, and while nighttime is great for rest, humans were once at greater risk of becoming the hunted at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, to cope with this increased risk, our attention to negative stimuli is unusually heightened at night. Where it might once have helped us jump at invisible threats, this hyper-focus on the negative can then feed into an altered reward/motivation system, making a person particularly prone to risky behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add sleep loss to the equation, and this state of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/consciousness" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73104" data-postid="177488" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;consciousness&lt;/a&gt; only becomes more problematic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are millions of people who are awake in the middle of the night, and there's fairly good evidence that their brain is not functioning as well as it does during the day," &lt;a href="https://mgriblog.org/2022/07/28/researchers-call-for-new-studies-to-learn-how-our-brains-change-when-were-awake-after-midnight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Elizabeth Klerman from Harvard University in 2022 when the study was published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My plea is for more research to look at that, because their health and safety, as well as that of others, is affected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the hypothesis use two examples to illustrate their point. The first example is of a heroin user who successfully manages their cravings in the day but succumbs to their desires at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second is of a college student struggling with insomnia, who begins to feel a sense of hopelessness, loneliness, and despair as the sleepless nights stack up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141230" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141230" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/PerspnStudyingLateAtNightLookingExhausted_R_U_642.jpg" alt="A person sitting at a desk while it's dark outside, looking tired and trying to study " class="size-full wp-image-141230" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/PerspnStudyingLateAtNightLookingExhausted_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/PerspnStudyingLateAtNightLookingExhausted_R_U_642-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141230" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;At night, our attention to negative stimuli is unusually heightened.

Suicide and self-harm are very common at night. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/neurologic/neurology/nocturnal-wakefulness-and-suicide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;some research&lt;/a&gt; reports a threefold higher risk of suicide between midnight and 6:00 am compared to any other time of day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7953996/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 concluded that nocturnal wakefulness is a suicide risk factor, "possibly through misalignment of circadian rhythms."&lt;br&gt;

In 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0955395920301134" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; at a supervised drug consumption center in Brazil revealed a 4.7-fold greater risk of opioid overdose at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these behaviors could be explained by sleep debt or the cover that darkness offers, but there are probably nighttime neurological changes at play, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers like Klerman and her colleagues think we need to investigate these factors further to make sure we are protecting those most at risk from nighttime wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, the authors said no studies have examined how sleep deprivation and circadian timing impact a person's reward processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, we don't really know how shift workers, such as pilots or doctors, are coping with their unusual sleep routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For six hours or so a day, we know surprisingly little about how the human brain works. Whether asleep or awake, the mind after midnight is a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnetp.2021.830338/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Network Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If this story has raised concerns or you need to talk to someone, &lt;a href="http://www.suicidestop.com/call_a_hotline.html"&gt;please consult this list to find a 24/7 crisis hotline in your country, and reach out for help.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in August 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                                    &lt;div class="hsa-paywall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawaii Department of Health has confirmed a case of rat lungworm disease in an individual on the island of Kauai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rat lungworm disease, a parasitic disease also known as neuroangiostrongyliasis, is known to be endemic on all islands in Hawaii. The diagnosed individual had no history of travel to other islands, outside the state or country, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The individual sought medical care after experiencing symptoms such as headaches, nausea, vomiting, neck stiffness and aversion to bright light. The Hawaii State Laboratories Division confirmed the diagnosis of rat lungworm, using newly available sensitive testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials, however, have not been able to identify the exact source of infection for this individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/disease_listing/rat-lungworm-neuroangiostrongyliasis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Rat lungworm disease&lt;/a&gt;, caused by a roundworm parasite called Angiostrongylus cantonensis, affects the brain and spinal cord and can result in long-term disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parasite is only found in rodents, but infected rodents can pass larvae of the worm in their feces, which can then be ingested by snails, slugs, and some other animals such as freshwater shrimp or prawns, which then become intermediate hosts.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Hawaii, DOH said, most people become ill by accidentally ingesting a snail or slug infected with the parasite, but can also become infected via an intermediate host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH said that from Jan. 1, 2014, to the present, there have been 102 cases of rat lungworm disease reported statewide — 78 from Hawaii County, 13 from Maui County, seven from Honolulu County and four from Kauai County, including this latest case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of cases, 84%, have been in Hawaii County, while the other 16% have been cases reported in visitors. The last case confirmed on Kauai was in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH said early diagnosis is important in order to target treatment, and to reduce the long-term effects associated with this disease. Prevention is also important statewide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thoroughly inspecting and washing all fresh fruits and vegetables under clean, running water is the most effective way to reduce the risk of rat lungworm disease,” said Dr. Sarah Kemble, state epidemiologist, in a news release. “Small slugs and snails on produce can be difficult to see. Cooking food thoroughly also kills the parasite that causes rat lungworm disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH provides the following recommendations to prevent rat lungworm disease:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Wash all fruits and vegetables under clean, running water to remove any tiny slugs or snails. Pay close attention to leafy greens. This is important whether produce comes from a local retailer, farmers market or backyard garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Control snail, slug and rat populations around homes, gardens and farms. Get rid of snails, slugs and rats safely by clearing debris where they might live. Consider using traps and baits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Maintain water catchment systems and replace filters regularly. Cover and protect catchment tanks, as slugs can crawl up the tank and get into the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;                                
                                
                                
                                                                
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="23" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6t002d3b79sgqrerqk@published"&gt;I’m a 46-year-old, bisexual woman who is 10 years older than my partner. I have a ton more experience and kinks than him.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqs4qxu00313b790k8riv2r@published"&gt;I’ve had to let the kinks go because it’s not in his nature. He’s also small compared to previous partners. He doesn’t have a micro penis, but it’s below average. You could say I was a size queen, as I used to only look for partners on the large end of the spectrum before I met him. I was also non-monogamous for five years before him. I had girlfriends, boyfriends, threesomes, and moresomes. It’s been eight years, and there’s no kink, no women, only one threesome, and a small penis.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="130" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6u002e3b79bcif00ay@published"&gt;I’m sad about all of this all the time. The sex is OK, and he puts in so much effort, but I miss the feeling of a larger penis. I love to give oral (so does he), but it’s a bummer that I can’t even use my hands and mouth at the same time. I can’t give him the full experience. I don’t try to have threesomes because I’m embarrassed by his size, and he would not be OK if I dated other men. I plan to be with him for the rest of my life; he is the best person I’ve ever met. However, right now, it’s me and my magic wand against the world. I don’t want him to feel like I have to use it every time.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6v002f3b797bzw61pg@published"&gt;Is there hope for me? How can I stop thinking about other, bigger penises all the time? I’m somewhat OK without BDSM, but I need something. I also find myself craving a relationship with a woman. We don’t have sex very often, which might contribute to the whole situation. Lastly, I’m conventionally attractive and get flirted with all the time. That does not help. I wish I weren’t experienced and “freaky.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="44" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6v002i3b799t6skhc8@published"&gt;There’s plenty of hope in several different directions. Our ability to control our thoughts is pretty limited, and mostly relies on mindfulness or actively thinking about something we want to think about instead of trying to push away the thoughts we hope to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6v002j3b79u2mvxcax@published"&gt;With direct answers to your questions out of the way, I have to point out: You sound pretty miserable. If you simply needed a place to vent, I’m happy we could provide that, and encourage you to consider who you might be able to trust to be that place for you in the future. You’ll want a friend who doesn’t know your partner, or at least isn’t socializing with them extensively, and who is able and willing to hold these frustrations without sharing them around town.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6w002k3b793rmp8gf1@published"&gt;Are you attracted to your partner? Your letter contained an extensive list of ways his physical attributes turn you off, and then a statement about him being the best person you’ve ever met, so I’m left wondering whether there’s anything about him that does turn you on but that you didn’t include.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="142" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6w002l3b79frhkurs0@published"&gt;If you aren’t attracted to him at all, in the sexual sense, could that be contributing to the infrequency of the sex you have together? I’m also wondering whether your description of kink as “not in his nature” means that you’ve made an assumption, and whether there might be more wiggle room there than you think. Have you given him the chance to decide for himself whether he’s up for any of the aspects of BDSM that you’re missing? Reading between the lines a little, men who are respectful, solicitous, and follow their female partners’ leads outside the bedroom often make great male doms with a bit of encouragement and support. What we might see as a man’s “nature” lending itself to sexual dominance can sometimes be an alpha identity or a more explicit tendency to be abusive. Give that some thought.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="127" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6x002m3b79j0ktdndg@published"&gt;Meanwhile, how much of your decision to stay with this partner is based on ideas about monogamy and vanilla sex being more “normal” or “better,” or in fear that you’ll never find a human as great as this one again, and, therefore, should rearrange yourself to keep him? If any of that resonates, spend some time with the friend I suggested you talk with up top, or with a sex-positive therapist, working toward a clearer understanding of what you actually need and want. It absolutely might be the case that you stick with your choice to forgo the extremely novel and varied sex life you used to have. Regardless, I think you’ll have an easier time living with your decision if you’re thorough about arriving at one.&lt;/p&gt;

However, I have one problem with him: His dick is GIGANTIC. It’s both a length problem and a girth issue—it’s nearly as thick around as a soda can. Penis-in-vagina sex is possible for us, but it takes a ton of foreplay and lube to make it happen. Much of the time, I don’t orgasm outside of non-penetrative sex because it feels like I’m being stretched to the breaking point. Is there some way I can loosen myself up so we can make this work physically?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="57" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqs6512003k3b79p87p5oe8@published"&gt;Girth is a little more complicated than length. First, foreplay is fantastic regardless. Ideally, this foreplay includes at least one adequate-to-great orgasm for you, as that tends to help with relaxing the vaginal canal. You also might try very slow penetration at first, or even entering without thrusting at all, to give your body time to adjust.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqs6514003l3b79irakxu97@published"&gt;Speaking of time, you’ve only been having sex with this man for a few weeks, so your body might do some adjusting of its own over the next few months. And you can work on letting the muscles in your pelvic floor relax. Try breathing techniques that encourage physical relaxation, and visualizing your body opening, until you find something that works for you or get fed up with the process. But do give each practice more than a single cursory attempt. Most likely, you’ll need a combination of these tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

We enjoyed this for many years, but once we had our first kid, we stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="122" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqs6gc2003x3b79czcjh5ph@published"&gt;We have two kids now (both under 5), and my husband has been eager to return to our old pastime. I really do not want to do this. Not only am I regularly left drained from dealing with two very young children, but the idea of a sex party taking place in an area where my kids play doesn’t sit well with me, no matter how good a job I might do of cleaning it. I haven’t given my husband a definitive answer on whether we will resume, but I know he’s going to be crushed when I tell him this is a chapter in our lives that I want to remain closed. Any advice on how to break it to him?&lt;/p&gt;

Your kids are going to get older and require less minute-by-minute care. They’ll start going to school for large portions of every weekday and participating in activities that don’t require your supervision in their free time. In a decade and a half, they’ll probably be out of the home entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqs6gc300413b79qdjoniu6@published"&gt;You could attend orgies organized by other people, or at locations outside your home. If you go to your husband with explanations for your decision that are fairly easy to work around, he’s almost certainly going to have hope that you’ll change your mind when the kids are older or if he finds a way to throw the party elsewhere. If you’re done with orgies for other reasons, get clear on that before you broach the subject with your husband and be prepared to share &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; reasons—even if it’s simply that you’re done and aren’t sure why.&lt;/p&gt;

The updated recommendations, published in the Journal of Human Nutrition &amp;amp; Dietetics and Neurogastroenterology &amp;amp; Motility, identify kiwis, rye bread, magnesium supplements, and probiotics as promising options for improving bowel regularity. These are the first evidence-based guidelines to focus on food-based management rather than medications. With constipation affecting around 16% of adults globally, experts say the new framework offers a long-overdue, science-backed approach to managing the condition naturally and improving quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is chronic constipation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constipation is typically defined as having fewer than three bowel movements a week, while chronic constipation refers to symptoms that persist for more than three months. It’s a widespread digestive issue that can cause hard stools, bloating, abdominal pain, and even nausea. According to the American College of Gastroenterology, constipation leads to around 2.5 million doctor visits in the U.S. annually. While anyone can experience it, the problem is especially common among women, older adults, and people with sedentary lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Experts warn that chronic constipation can take a toll on both physical comfort and emotional well-being if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Best foods and supplements that relieve constipation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines recommend several targeted dietary changes to relieve symptoms and improve bowel function:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kiwis&lt;/strong&gt;: Eating three kiwis a day — with or without the skin — can help increase stool frequency. Studies show that kiwis contain enzymes and fibers that support digestive movement, though they don’t significantly change stool consistency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rye bread&lt;/strong&gt;: Six to eight slices of rye bread per day may aid stool frequency, though this quantity might be difficult for some people to manage daily.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium oxide supplements&lt;/strong&gt;: A daily dose of 0.5–1.5 grams can enhance stool softness, reduce bloating, and improve overall comfort.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;keyword id="29506441" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="fiber-supplements" source="keywords"&gt;Fiber supplements&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: More than 10 grams of fiber supplements such as psyllium per day can increase bowel regularity. The dosage should be introduced gradually to avoid gas and discomfort.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Probiotics&lt;/strong&gt;: Specific strains like Bifidobacterium lactis and Bacillus coagulans may help balance gut bacteria and ease symptoms when taken consistently for at least four weeks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High mineral-content water&lt;/strong&gt;: Drinking 0.5–1.5 liters daily, especially water rich in magnesium, can complement other dietary treatments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why diet plays a crucial role&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although traditional advice often centers on eating more fiber and drinking plenty of water, researchers say those recommendations are too broad and not always backed by solid evidence. Eirini Dimidi, lead author of the new guidelines and associate professor at King’s College London, explained that many existing strategies rely heavily on pharmaceuticals rather than nutrition. “We realised that the dietary recommendations available were limited and lacked robust research,” she said. The new review aims to fill that gap by identifying specific foods and supplements that have demonstrated consistent results in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A step toward better digestive health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimidi and her team hope these guidelines will help both healthcare providers and individuals make more informed choices. “We want people to feel empowered to take control of their symptoms using evidence-based dietary strategies,” she said. Chronic constipation can deeply affect daily life — from limiting physical activity to causing discomfort and stress. By embracing these new recommendations, individuals can explore natural, research-backed options to restore regularity and improve their overall digestive health. Even small, consistent dietary changes can make a lasting difference—helping your gut function better and your body feel lighter every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 17:23:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwJBVV95cUxNaE80ZG1YZkRBSEk5Um4zNi1tVUxOMVYzUFl3dVo2MVhlY3N1Z2p4WDVlX2QtbHlpYmRyekU4TmVlaElPem5jeklFQnhvS0Iya2VXWmNGR2xJREVTMjZYaHJsV0FnaE5Udmx0WU0tQTREZE91cXhwd2tTa2kzQktVSXI0eEpkTHp0dV82MUp0LUt0YVQwNnQ1LXlSZ1hybTNTSWVhMlVJVnlhR2JYLWdPUjFGTDFzbG1VOEZUb1pFNUVLaEpYS1RKWUxjWndIVzhVclVYbDVEbzBkVjVkcXNwaThtTndjdUpiWXNROUZxOFdkVkVqdk93Z09mdTlTczhOR2t4NjdXbzNxWWFQZVMwQ3J4dW9pLU0</guid></item><item><title>明尼苏达州几十年来最严重的西尼罗河疫情造成10人死亡- Bring Me The News</title><link>https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-news/10-dead-in-minnesotas-worst-west-nile-outbreak-in-decades</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Bring Me The News</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 17:07:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxOWDNfWGQxNlhnVHVWOEF4ZDdYSTA0aWRZdE1zbDd6ZjU2dFdPSVZxb3NYWVhRRzJFdjBsMHNZZWp4Sk5RNnNwV19vTTR6U29fZURIcFdmZFBqZXpySUl3Z0c0TUVVRllVbVZzV21HZlVSdXkwZk1MTU5iY2lfbmt1LW9IWWs2ZWFzZUx2aDdYZHBPbnp2WC1yMEMtOUo0S0Jf</guid></item><item><title>医生恳求乘客不要在车上犯同样不必要的错误……这可能会让你付出生命的代价--《每日邮报》</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15191127/Emergency-room-doctors-mistake-car-crash-accident.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors in the emergency room are issuing an urgent warning to car passengers who get too comfortable in their seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many passengers instinctively prop their feet on the dashboard to sit back and relax during a road trip, often without considering the potential dangers of this seemingly harmless habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But placing one’s feet on the dashboard is extremely dangerous. In a sudden stop, the body continues moving forward with the car's momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If feet are on the dashboard, this can force the legs into a position that causes severe &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-7924629/Womans-hips-crushed-crash-propped-feet-dashboard.html"&gt;injuries like hip breaks&lt;/a&gt;, bone fractures and joint dislocations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, airbags deploy with tremendous force during a collision. If a passenger's feet are on the dashboard, the airbag can impact the legs with enough power to cause fractures, dislocations, and other severe injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The seat belt is the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14430187/Doctors-dangers-not-wearing-seatbelt.html"&gt;primary defense in a crash&lt;/a&gt;, but this safety measure is compromised when feet are on the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In this position, the seat belt cannot properly restrain the passenger, increasing the risk of being thrown forward. This can lead to severe head injuries, broken bones or even ejection from the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Feet on the dashboard also impedes a passenger's reaction time, preventing them from bracing quickly for sudden stops or obstacles and endangering all occupants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Feet on the dashboard prevents the seatbelt from properly restraining a passenger, dramatically increasing the risk of severe injury or ejection in a crash&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Solomon Behar, a pediatric emergency medicine physician at Miller Children’s &amp;amp; Women’s Hospital in Long Beach, California, told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.aol.com/articles/er-docs-want-people-stop-145000250.html"&gt;Parade &lt;/a&gt;magazine: ‘I do a lot of driving on Los Angeles freeways, and one of the things that makes me cringe is when I pass a passenger who has their feet up on the dashboard.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Placing feet on the dashboard fundamentally alters the passenger's posture and, consequently, the function of the seatbelt, creating a cascade of failure points in the event of a collision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Behar added: ‘[Sitting upright with feed on the floor is safest because] it allows the seat belt and airbag systems to function as they were supposed to, distributing the forces more evenly and actually reducing the risk of drying your legs and pelvis.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During a frontal collision, the body will pivot at the waist and slide underneath the lap belt, which allows the lower body to thrust forward while the upper body is unrestrained, dramatically increasing the risk of severe internal abdominal injuries and spinal damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the car stops or slams into another vehicle in front, the head, torso and lower body are all thrown forward with the car’s momentum, but the locked seatbelt restrains the torso. Meanwhile, the lower body continues to move forward violently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The knees, already pressed against the dashboard, become a pivot point while the dashboard stops the lower legs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The thigh bones are the long, strong levers that concentrate immense force on the hips and knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can lead to a fracture of the socket of the hip joint in the pelvis, which endangers the entire structure of the hip and often requires extensive reconstructive surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Based on 2019-2020 data, the most recent data published by the CDC, the rate of emergency department visits for car crashes varied significantly by age, averaging 11.6 visits per 1,000 people annually. The rate peaked at 19.1 for young adults aged 15-24&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The long thigh bone can snap near the hip or just above the knee from the bending stress and the kneecap can be shattered as it is crushed between the femur and the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jacob Snow, a pediatric emergency room specialist at Pediatrix Medical Group in Las Vegas, Nevada, said: ‘Cars are designed to protect passengers seated with their feet on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It prevents the risk of your legs buckling or being pushed back into your face by the dash itself or the airbags. Additionally, many cars have special airbags designed to protect your legs.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An airbag deploys at speeds between 100 and 220 MPH. If a passenger's feet are on the dashboard at the moment of deployment, the explosive force can drive their knees backward with enough violence to cause severe facial and head trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Snow added: ‘There is always some risk of being involved in a car accident every time you ride or drive. Riding with your feet on the dash adds unnecessary risk.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 16:18:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOcVFnMWJHUHpSS24xY0tJdVFLX3dWbGdSYV9Sc0dWczFMMnhMTWhQbnY2X1lYYmp2a2pFdUZoQWJUNEZobUxBMzJSMUlKanNtcXo3X09Fd0pIWVZNRkFnOUwxV2k0Sm1BQmxTT2ZPbXViUWU1Q2NsSW01a004bzhIWmNyc1dJbllwYlBYUDY5bmJtbTRCb3Y0anZGSkVnaHEyaWUxc2xPYVJfd9IBrwFBVV95cUxQa2tfb3ljcjE5NG5nR0pWRE91eC1lODJuMER1c2xUOGdYd2xmV3BBMWNJc01aeGhab3RaUTJvbWcyOWdta1ROUmF1WURCMjhlSFhzNXB5RnZXRjB4ZGtJRllNRFlLekZtRzNRNDgweDJsLTMzMzRlQ2N3eXB5MFFVS2ZlMGNTM3dOTUs2cHVIb1JWZEV1WmVKaWNtUjM5M2xDU09OMmZFTFBkVzlqMFlF</guid></item><item><title>南非卫生部长对新的艾滋病预防接种表示欢迎，但警告供应有限- ABC新闻-突发新闻、最新新闻和视频</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/south-africas-health-minister-hails-new-hiv-prevention-126514241</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;&lt;span class="oyrPY qlwaB AGxeB  "&gt;JOHANNESBURG -- &lt;/span&gt;JOHANNESBURG (AP) — South Africa's health minister on Tuesday called &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/article/hiv-prevention-shot-lenacapavir-gilead-80fb37e2c5ac9b452488d7b86a10d568"&gt;lenacapavir,&lt;/a&gt; the first twice-yearly HIV prevention jab in the world, a “groundbreaking” tool to fight the disease, but warned initial donated supply would be limited to nearly half a million people in the African country with the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/hub/hiv-and-aids"&gt;highest prevalence rate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This comes just weeks after the U.S. announced plans to buy &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/article/hiv-prevention-lenacapavir-trump-pepfar-e85c9b8772141722fccc4b7b349ef809"&gt;2 million doses of the HIV prevention drug&lt;/a&gt; for low-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The initial supply in South Africa is set to begin in April 2026, funded by a $29.2 million Global Fund grant with an additional $5 million allocated by the Networking HIV and AIDS Community of Southern Africa (NACOSA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Addressing a national healthcare roundtable dialogue in Johannesburg, Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said the Global Funds’ catalytic commitment will deliver around 456,000 lenacapavir initiations over two years, translating into 912,000 doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“We plan to roll out lenacapavir initially in about 23 high-incident districts across six provinces, targeting around 360 high-performing public clinics within these areas for phase one implementation,” said the minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“About half a million people will be able to begin using lenacapavir, and thanks to this support, but demand will likely outstrip supply at first,” said Motsoaledi, highlighting that research data suggested that prioritizing vulnerable populations in high-burden districts first would result in the highest impact in terms of new infections prevented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The minister was quick to caution against complacency with the initial investment after South Africa’s health system was significantly hit by the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-agency-for-international-development"&gt;abrupt cuts to funding&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-trump-pepfar-hiv-aid-freeze-0d9def2a63b0e2f53bfda9441baf584d"&gt;USAID and other U.S. government sources&lt;/a&gt; in early 2025. These cuts have had a severe impact on HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB) treatment, prevention, and research programs across the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Although Motsoaledi expressed gratitude that Gilead had lowered the price from the $28,000, initially touted to $40, per person annually, he said that South Africa aimed to fund its program independently, with long-term funding hinging on lenacapavir’s integration into local systems, such as the essential medicines list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The World Health Organization in July recommended the six-month HIV prevention jab that’s already &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/article/hiv-drug-injectable-ema-europe-approval-6c60e9dc07776af2af88ee121e015e2b"&gt;approved in the U.S. and Europe&lt;/a&gt;, as an additional prevention choice as part of combination approaches. Gilead is expediting registration in 18 high-incidence countries, including South Africa, to deliver lenacapavir until generic versions become available in 2027. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Early in October, Gilead Sciences announced it had executed voluntary, non-exclusive, royalty-free license contracts with six pharmaceutical companies in Egypt, Pakistan, and India to produce and market generic lenacapavir. Despite participating in the clinical trials for the drug in recent years, South African companies were excluded from Gilead Sciences’ voluntary licensing, which has infuriated civil society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“This is not the principle of ubuntu,” said Sheila Mbele-Khama, in reference to the South African philosophy that values principles such as human dignity and fairness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Mbele-Khama, speaking on behalf of the South African National Aids Council (SANAC), claimed during the roundtable that one out of every four new HIV infections took place in the 26 nations that Gilead didn’t give licenses to. “You can’t come in the house to ask us to allow you to learn and then you run away, you no longer include us”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;According to Wendy Cupido, country manager for Gilead, the South African manufacturers that were evaluated in 2024 did not satisfy the technical specifications for the production of sterile injectables at that time. She said, though, that Gilead was still willing to look at further voluntary licensing if a South African manufacturer could develop the required capabilities and meet quality standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Welcoming the over $34 million in investment into the rollout, UNAIDS South Africa country director Eva Kiwango said at a time when foreign assistance funding cuts could lead to an additional 6 million HIV infections globally by 2029, long-acting injectable medicines were a “fresh option for all people at risk,”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“It is not a cure or a vaccine, but it could be a game changer if made accessible to all who could benefit,” said Kiwango. “For many, lenacapavir expands choice, strengthens agency, and reduces barriers linked to stigma, disclosure, or daily adherence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The roundtable is a two-day event that will conclude on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For more on Africa and development: &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse"&gt;https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

After our interview, she said she was going to go for a walk, to enjoy the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;unseasonably warm weather in San Anselmo, just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she's not at the gym with clients or working out herself, she's at the local humane society, where she teaches a range of classes, including basic obedience and canine exercise. She helps&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;old dogs age gracefully and works&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;with four-legged athletes in agility or diving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing about longevity, I speak to a lot of senior athletes. And yet, I'm struck by Mimms' remarkably youthful energy; she appears decades younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She started dancing at age 12, training in ballet at first, and later fell in love with &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/20-dance-styles-from-around-the-world" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;modern dance.&lt;/a&gt; Mimms initially had a career in the restaurant industry before returning to the studio, ultimately training to teach&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;dance and, later, fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, she keeps in shape (and puts off retirement), to inspire others, and offered three &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-lessons-100-year-old-woman-lift-weights-2025-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;longevity tips&lt;/a&gt; for staying spry over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you can breathe, you can move," she said.

She added that it helps that she never married or had children, giving her more time for her own interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While research is mixed on how marriage and childbearing impact longevity, it's likely that she had genetics on her side.

These days, she focuses more on exercises like cable rows, wood chops, lunges, and kettlebell lifts or swings. A typical session is a circuit-style workout of these exercises for about three rounds each, or 30 minutes total, adding up to about three hours a week of strength training.&lt;/p&gt;

The tongue thing persisted, but didn't get worse," he says. But by the time winter rolled around, Greene noticed his &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/womens-health/npr-mary-louise-kelly-hearing-loss-rcna78925" target="_blank"&gt;hearing had gotten significantly worse&lt;/a&gt; in that ear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-865ab6" class="body-graf"&gt;Greene and his wife go out to dinner once a week, and he'd started to notice that, "if I was not on her right side, I couldn't hear the conversation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e22e94" class="body-graf"&gt;At that point, he says, "I realized my hearing was going on the right side, and at the same time, that numbness was spreading to my cheek area from just the tongue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dbc712" class="body-graf"&gt;This time, his doctor sent him to a different ENT, who suspected the issue may be brain-related and recommended Greene get an MRI and see a neurologist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3dc3ac" class="body-graf"&gt;On April 11, 2025, almost exactly a year after his symptoms first began, Greene went for the brain MRI, which confirmed that the issue was neurological: Greene had a nearly golf ball-sized tumor pressing on the nerves responsible for hearing and facial sensations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-99b6c7" class="body-heading"&gt;An MRI Revealed a Brain Tumor &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f39adf" class="body-graf"&gt;Greene was diagnosed with a vestibular schwannoma, a type of non-cancerous tumor that grows out of the lining of a nerve in the inner ear, Dr. Omar Arnaout, a neurosurgeon who specializes in treating these tumors at Mass General Brigham, tells TODAY.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a5efe4" class="body-graf"&gt;Specifically, the tumor develops from Schwann cells, which form the insulated lining of the vestibular nerves that are responsible for balance. But the vestibular nerves share that small inner ear canal with other nerves, including those responsible for hearing and facial sensations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eb3f04" class="body-graf"&gt;Of those nerves, the hearing nerve "is very fragile," Arnaout explains. "It's the most sensitive." So, a tumor that grows on the vestibular nerve is likely to press on the hearing nerve and cause symptoms there first, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cae1cf" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, the symptoms of a &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/what-acoustic-neuroma-dad-35-diagnosed-brain-tumor-t216069" target="_blank"&gt;vestibular schwannoma&lt;/a&gt; (also called a vestibular neuroma) tend to be less dramatic than those of other brain tumors, like &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/mom-severe-headaches-brain-tumor-rcna95149" target="_blank"&gt;glioblastomas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-73f6e0" class="body-graf"&gt;“These are slow-growing, benign tumors, and the symptoms tend to be pretty subtle," Arnaout explains. "So it’s very common for people to go a while before they get diagnosed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ae6e89" class="body-graf"&gt;A story like Greene's — a young, otherwise healthy person with subtle symptoms — is typical for patients who end up being diagnosed with this type of tumor, Arnaout says. Often, the first symptom is either decreased hearing, like Greene experienced, or tinnitus, a type of ringing or buzzing in the ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2e2a9f" class="body-graf"&gt;At first, people typically ignore these early mild symptoms, Arnaout says. But they don't go away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-743193" class="body-graf"&gt;After a while, "the natural thing to do is to get a hearing test," he explains, "and the test actually reveals a certain pattern of hearing loss that is associated more often than not with a tumor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8ee2d9" class="body-graf"&gt;In Greene's case, he underwent two hearing tests. The first, in the spring of 2024, showed that he did have reduced hearing in one ear, but it was still within the range of normal, he recalls. The second happened the day before his MRI, at which point his hearing loss was much more profound. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7be528" class="body-graf"&gt;"It was very frustrating because I could hear that a sound was being made, but I couldn't distinguish what word was being spoken," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-39fff8" class="body-heading"&gt;A Lengthy, Delicate Surgery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4f6ffe" class="body-graf"&gt;When these tumors are smaller, doctors might leave them alone and just monitor them, Arnaout says. "Sometimes we catch them and they're like the size of a grain of rice or a raisin," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c4b0f2" class="body-graf"&gt;But when they're more medium-sized, like Greene's 3-centimeter tumor, "they start to push up against the brainstem, and now you're having a little bit of a different conversation," says Arnaout, who was one of the surgeons who performed Greene's brain surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ffee75" class="body-graf"&gt;If left untreated, the tumor could continue to grow and cause &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/what-acoustic-neuroma-dad-35-diagnosed-brain-tumor-t216069" target="_blank"&gt;more severe — potentially life-threatening — issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-6adf3b"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="5712" data-original-width="4284"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/-Stephen-GreeneAS10142025-3-63a3c2.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/-Stephen-GreeneAS10142025-3-63a3c2.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/-Stephen-GreeneAS10142025-3-63a3c2.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/-Stephen-GreeneAS10142025-3-63a3c2.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/-Stephen-GreeneAS10142025-3-63a3c2.jpg" alt="Stephen Greene's operation required two surgical teams."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Stephen Greene's operation required two surgical teams.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Stephen Greene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3581f9" class="body-graf"&gt;Greene underwent surgery, most of which was performed by a neurosurgery team (including Arnaout in his case) and handed off to an ear surgeon in the final stages. It's not uncommon for these surgeries to be quite long, Arnaout says, and Greene's was around 12 to 13 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2c8e53" class="body-graf"&gt;The brain surgery team creates the opening, takes the pressure off the brainstem, and starts the delicate work around the nerves until the team gets to the ear canal, Arnaout explains, at which point the ear surgery team takes over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0f7ce1" class="body-graf"&gt;In Greene's case, the surgeons decided to leave a small bit (about 5%) of the tumor behind to reduce the risk of facial paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-d87486" class="body-heading"&gt;'You Can't Control It, But You Can Handle It'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a35e94" class="body-graf"&gt;Greene's surgery was successful and he did not have any facial paralysis. But the hearing he lost is permanently gone. He'll be meeting with a specialist in January to discuss possible implants or other devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-db8000" class="body-graf"&gt;And his recovery has been long and challenging in other ways, he says. Waking up after surgery, "there's double vision, there's certainly brain fog, not being able to remember or kind of get your thoughts across," Greene recalls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a07e87" class="body-graf"&gt;He also had to "relearn to walk a little bit."

These subtle movements may offer vital insights into aging and conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Cardiovascular Research&lt;/em&gt;, the study presents the first noninvasive approach for measuring "microvascular volumetric pulsatility" -- the rhythmic swelling and shrinking of tiny blood vessels -- in living humans. Using ultra-high field 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the researchers found that these microvessel pulses become stronger with age, particularly in the brain's deep white matter. This region is essential for communication between brain networks but is also vulnerable to reduced blood flow from distal arteries, which carry blood from the heart to the outermost parts of the body. As these pulses intensify, they may interfere with brain function and contribute to memory decline and Alzheimer's progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Arterial pulsation is like the brain's natural pump, helping to move fluids and clear waste," said Danny JJ Wang, PhD, professor of neurology and radiology at the Keck School of Medicine and senior author of the study. "Our new method allows us to see, for the first time in people, how the volumes of those tiny blood vessels change with aging and vascular risk factors. This opens new avenues for studying brain health, dementia, and small vessel disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long recognized that stiffness and excessive pulsation in large arteries are linked to stroke, dementia, and small vessel disease. However, until now, it has been nearly impossible to observe these rhythmic changes in the brain's smallest vessels without using invasive procedures limited to animal studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome this, the USC team combined two advanced MRI techniques -- vascular space occupancy (VASO) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) -- to monitor subtle shifts in microvessel volume throughout the cardiac cycle. Their results revealed that older adults exhibit stronger microvascular pulsations in deep white matter compared to younger individuals, and that hypertension further intensifies these effects. "These findings provide a missing link between what we see in large vessel imaging and the microvascular damage we observe in aging and Alzheimer's disease," said lead author Fanhua Guo, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in Wang's lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive vascular pulsation may also disrupt the brain's "glymphatic system," a recently discovered network that removes waste substances such as beta-amyloid, a protein that accumulates in Alzheimer's disease. Over time, interference with this fluid circulation could hasten cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Being able to measure these tiny vascular pulses in vivo is a critical step forward," said Arthur W. Toga, PhD, director of the Stevens INI. "This technology not only advances our understanding of brain aging but also holds promise for early diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegenerative disorders."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers are exploring how the method could be adapted for wider clinical use, including on more commonly available 3T MRI scanners. Future studies will test whether microvascular volumetric pulsatility predicts cognitive outcomes and whether it can serve as a biomarker for early intervention in Alzheimer's disease and related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is just the beginning," Wang said. "Our goal is to bring this from research labs into clinical practice, where it could guide diagnosis, prevention, and treatment strategies for millions at risk of dementia."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Wang, the study's other authors are Fanhua Guo, Chenyang Zhao, Qinyang Shou, Kay Jann, and Xingfeng Shao from the Stevens INI, and Ning Jin from Siemens Healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

This progressive loss of brain cells leads to severe symptoms including memory decline, cognitive impairment, and difficulty with movement. Over time, these conditions can greatly diminish quality of life and often leave patients dependent on continuous care. Current medications can help ease symptoms but do not stop or reverse the underlying disease, highlighting the urgent need for new therapeutic approaches. One promising strategy focuses on stimulating neuronal differentiation, the process of forming new neurons that could replace those lost and potentially slow or counteract neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin K, a fat-soluble nutrient best known for its role in blood clotting and bone health, has recently attracted attention for its influence on brain cell development and protection. However, naturally occurring vitamin K forms such as menaquinone 4 (MK-4) may not be potent enough for effective use in regenerative therapies targeting neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a groundbreaking study published in &lt;em&gt;ACS Chemical Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, researchers from the Department of Bioscience and Engineering at Shibaura Institute of Technology in Japan, led by Associate Professor Yoshihisa Hirota and Professor Yoshitomo Suhara, created and tested new vitamin K analogues with stronger neuroactive effects. The team also identified a distinct mechanism through which vitamin K promotes neuronal differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explaining their findings, Dr. Hirota noted, "The newly synthesized vitamin K analogues demonstrated approximately threefold greater potency in inducing the differentiation of neural progenitor cells into neurons compared to natural vitamin K. Since neuronal loss is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, these analogues may serve as regenerative agents that help replenish lost neurons and restore brain function."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To boost vitamin K's biological impact, the team produced 12 hybrid vitamin K homologs by linking them with retinoic acid (an active metabolite of vitamin A that encourages neuronal differentiation), a carboxylic acid group, or a methyl ester side chain. They then evaluated how effectively each compound promoted neuronal differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin K and retinoic acid influence gene transcription through the steroid and xenobiotic receptor (SXR) and retinoic acid receptor (RAR), respectively. The researchers measured SXR and RAR activity in mouse neural progenitor cells treated with the newly developed compounds and found that the hybrids maintained the biological functions of both parent molecules. They also measured the expression of microtubule-associated protein 2 (Map2), a neuronal growth marker, to track cell differentiation. One compound, which combined retinoic acid with a methyl ester side chain, produced a threefold increase in neuronal differentiation compared with the control and showed significantly stronger activity than natural vitamin K. This enhanced version was designated as the Novel vitamin K analog (Novel VK).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand how vitamin K protects neurons, the team compared gene expression patterns in neural stem cells treated with MK-4, which promotes neuronal differentiation, to those treated with a compound that suppresses it. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that vitamin K-induced neuronal differentiation is mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) through downstream epigenetic and transcriptional processes. The effect of MK-4 was specifically linked to mGluR1. Previous studies have shown that mGluR1 plays a key role in synaptic communication, and that mice lacking this receptor experience motor and synaptic impairments similar to those seen in neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delving deeper, the researchers conducted structural simulations and molecular docking studies to elucidate whether the vitamin K homolog interacts with mGluR1. Indeed, their analysis revealed a stronger binding affinity between Novel VK and mGluR1. Finally, the researchers examined the cellular uptake of Novel VK and its conversion to bioactive MK-4 in cells and mice. They noted a significant concentration-dependent increase in the intracellular concentration of MK-4. Moreover, Novel VK converted to MK-4 more easily than natural vitamin K. Further, &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments in mice showed that Novel VK exhibited a stable pharmacokinetic profile, crossed the blood-brain barrier, and achieved higher MK-4 concentration in the brain compared to the control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the study sheds light on the mechanism by which vitamin K and its structural analogues exert neuroprotective effects, paving the way for the development of novel therapeutic agents that can delay or reverse neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concluding with the long-term implications of their work, Dr. Hirota says, "Our research offers a potentially groundbreaking approach to treating neurodegenerative diseases. A vitamin K-derived drug that slows the progression of Alzheimer's disease or improves its symptoms could not only improve the quality of life for patients and their families but also significantly reduce the growing societal burden of healthcare expenditures and long-term caregiving."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope their research translates into clinically meaningful treatments for patients battling neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Though the risk of serious illness from West Nile virus is low, less than 1% of those infected can develop a serious illness known as neuroinvasive West Nile, which is fatal for about 10% of patients. People 50 years of age and older have a higher chance of getting sick and are more likely to develop complications. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Yes, it’s a natural part of the aging process (and there are so many &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/gray-hair-styles" target="_blank"&gt;chic ways&lt;/a&gt; to let it grow out, it can even be a welcome change), but when you’re nowhere near where you thought you would be for that type of hair transformation, it can be a bit jarring. So what gives?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many factors that play into our &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/gray-hair-styles" target="_blank"&gt;hair graying&lt;/a&gt; prematurely. Family history, free radicals in the body, and oxidative stress are just some of the most common ones, says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.instagram.com/lmmedicalnyc/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.instagram.com/lmmedicalnyc/"}' href="https://www.instagram.com/lmmedicalnyc/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Morgan Rabach&lt;/a&gt;, MD, board-certified dermatologist at &lt;a data-offer-url="https://lmmedicalnyc.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://lmmedicalnyc.com/"}' href="https://lmmedicalnyc.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LM Medical NYC&lt;/a&gt;. One that doesn’t get talked about enough is how food—or lack of certain ones—can impact when those gray strands will appear on your head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vitamin deficiencies can contribute to premature gray hair by interfering with melanin production and causing oxidative stress within the hair follicles,” adds Samantha Dieras, RN, DCN, director of ambulatory nutrition services at Mount Sinai Hospital. “The melanocytes (pigment-producing cells) may become damaged or dysfunctional in the absence of these nutrients, leading to loss of color.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: eating or not eating certain foods isn’t the end-all, be-all to losing your natural color. Dieras goes on to say that while studies have shown that it may be helpful to eat certain foods for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6369637/" target="_blank"&gt;repigmentation&lt;/a&gt; of their graying hair, it’s still a small part of the gray hair puzzle. With that in mind, the five best types of foods to incorporate into your diet to at least help include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Copper-Rich Foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foods to Try:&lt;/strong&gt; Liver, oysters, potatoes, and mushrooms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The element copper is key to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5855855/" target="_blank"&gt;melanin synthesis&lt;/a&gt;, says Dr. Rabach, and low levels of it may cause reduced pigmentation production in our hair. Some foods you could eat to offset a copper deficiency include potatoes, where one whole potato contains &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Copper-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;675 micrograms (mcg) of the nutrient,&lt;/a&gt; and mushrooms, which contain &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Copper-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;650 mcg&lt;/a&gt; for every half cup cooked. If you love shellfish and meat, oysters are packed with the nutrient and contain &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Copper-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;4,850 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of copper for every 3 ounces cooked, while 3 ounces of cooked beef liver contains &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Copper-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;12,400 mcg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Iron-Rich Foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foods to Try:&lt;/strong&gt; Red meat, poultry, legumes, and spinach&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE9LclltYVg2dVh0Xy1EVVJhMVR3czNGZkJ3cGU2YUZkd1BIa2Q2b1hNNWFUd0h1UERkZV9YM0VNb1N6VXNfUDcyTkxaZWlIY3k3eUx0U3E2bEVWNWJsQmthZndxd0ZXOElBanc</guid></item><item><title>当海豚用突变的大脑冲上海滩时，对人类的可怕警告-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-15188909/warning-humans-dolphins-Alzheimers.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have uncovered a disturbing link between stranded dolphins and a toxin known to trigger Alzheimer's-like brain damage, which could have implications for millions of people along the US coast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers examined 20 dolphins that washed up along &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/florida/index.html" id="mol-99a06c40-a90a-11f0-9db4-65eae7fbd7ec"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;'s Indian River Lagoon and found high levels of a brain-damaging chemical produced by cyanobacteria, also called blue-green algae. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These microscopic organisms release compounds that are highly toxic to nerve cells, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15080677/tests-predict-dementia-iron-mri-john-hopkins.html"&gt;damaging the brain regions&lt;/a&gt; responsible for memory, thinking and communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dolphins stranded during peak algae blooms had up to 2,900 times more of the toxin than those found at other times of the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14976983/warning-humanity-blue-whales-silent.html"&gt;Their brains also showed&lt;/a&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Scientists have discovered a link between stranded dolphins and a toxin known to trigger Alzheimer's-like brain damage (STOCK)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists found the hallmarks of Alzheimer's in the brains of all the dolphins tested, including misfolded tau proteins (center), amyloid plaques (left) and tangled fibers (right) that destroy neural connections&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, are microscopic organisms that thrive in warm, nutrient-rich waters, especially where agricultural runoff and sewage introduce high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During 'blooms,' these organisms multiply rapidly, turning waterways bright green or blue-green and releasing toxins into the surrounding water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While these blooms may look harmless, they produce a range of toxins, including β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) and its chemical relatives 2,4-Diaminobutyric acid (2,4-DAB) and N-2-aminoethylglycine (AEG), which are highly toxic to nerve cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers noted that over time, the exposure can lead to the same type of brain changes seen in Alzheimer’s disease, including misfolded tau proteins, amyloid plaques and tangled fibers that destroy neural connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The link between these toxins and neurodegenerative disease is not just theoretical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Research involving residents of Guam has shown that people who regularly consume foods containing cyanobacterial toxins are more likely to develop the same brain abnormalities seen in Alzheimer's disease,' the team shared in a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251011105521.htm"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The brains of affected individuals showed the same protein misfolding and plaque formation that occurs in Alzheimer’s patients worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experiments in laboratory animals have confirmed these findings, demonstrating that prolonged exposure to BMAA can induce cognitive decline and brain lesions virtually identical to those observed in Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The team studied 20 dolphins stranded on the shores of Florida 's Indian River Lagoon, finding they all had signs of Alzheimer's &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In dolphins, the situation is particularly alarming, as top predators in marine ecosystems, dolphins are highly susceptible to bioaccumulation, the process by which toxins build up in the bodies of animals at the top of the food chain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Small fish and invertebrates ingest cyanobacterial toxins, and these compounds gradually concentrate as they move up the chain. By the time they reach dolphins, the levels can be extremely high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers at the Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute in Melbourne Beach, Florida, along with collaborators at the University of Miami and the Blue World Research Institute, analyzed the brains of 20 bottlenose dolphins stranded from 2010 to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found dolphins that washed ashore during periods of peak algae blooms had up to 2,900 times more 2,4-DAB in their brains than dolphins stranded at other times of the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The brains displayed many hallmark signs of Alzheimer’s disease, including sticky β-amyloid plaques, hyperphosphorylated tau proteins and TDP-43 protein inclusions, a marker of more aggressive neurodegenerative forms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists also identified changes in 536 genes that correspond to patterns associated with Alzheimer’s in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The problem is worsening with climate change and increased nutrient runoff, as warmer water temperatures and prolonged sunlight create ideal conditions for cyanobacteria to bloom more often and for longer periods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Florida, water released from Lake Okeechobee into the St Lucie River and Indian River Lagoon has repeatedly carried high concentrations of cyanobacteria downstream, creating large areas of toxic water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For dolphins navigating these waters, long-term exposure is practically unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Since dolphins are considered environmental sentinels for toxic exposures in marine environments, there are concerns about human health issues associated with cyanobacterial blooms,' Davis said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 14:57:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQQTgwTkpTUDJmODMzMXFmMmphNWtGLVN6NUFQYUxtbmllTzdqa0NPMjQzNzBtN3NRdlctT05HZmZGX0dqQTVkd1V3N3haUU5rZ0JPWnZPMjV3RkRUSVlkaUoyMHVFZGRXeVFOLWVpZFNBX2hHck5YN1hOWUx0WG5VWW9BS3V6OEM5S1l1SE9tUlFIY04wbko1M1JIUDfSAaIBQVVfeXFMTldUdFFpRWZJa0NBTkg5NTYtREFKOEdkQVg0Tkc3ODFiNXBndVA4ZzRiZlBvamxvcWtTSXNEYXNPRGV4b1NtM2o1bEpSdHpxRnhjQ0JwTWtJWXd6UGhZZnZpcXYzcDNfLXJDQ1ZNNExJdjJ0Ql9nb2NwSVAxRGFManBMaGJBTW9naUlmUzh4MkdWV0xrVm00VHVDN2x2bWFFUzFn</guid></item><item><title>加重背心是怎么回事？ -第19期新闻</title><link>https://19thnews.org/2025/10/weighted-vests-menopause-newsletter/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenberg article-body-width js-hang-punc"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone on Instagram — and walking down the sidewalk or around the playground — seems to be wearing a weighted vest. Everyone but me.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Forbes &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2025/08/19/weighted-vests-are-now-a-fitness-trend-heres-what-you-need-to-know/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the weighted vest market generated $205 million in 2024, and that number is expected to be even higher for 2025. So it’s not all in my head: They’re big business, and American women are happily buying in. A political pollster recently found that &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/19/weighted-vest-women-are-the-2026-swing-voters-00572657"&gt;1 in 6 American women&lt;/a&gt; has one. &lt;/p&gt;


  

  
      
  





&lt;p&gt;That has made me feel a little left out and paranoid. Was I doing a major disservice to my health by not strapping [checks notes] three to 30 pounds to my back to walk around my neighborhood? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cue the expert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So I reached out to &lt;a href="https://www.scranton.edu/directory/profiles/health-and-human-performance/joan-grossman.shtml"&gt;Joan Grossman&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, a registered dietitian/nutritionist who is also an associate professor of health and human performance at the University of Scranton. Her research focuses on how various forms of exercise impact post-menopausal body composition and performance. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Grossman said that when it comes to health and longevity, the most important thing is daily body resistance training, or strength training. Such training — using resistance to build muscle strength — is critical for bone health, heart health and metabolic health; research has found that women who engage in regular strength training live longer. It helps preserve the lean muscle mass that’s important for health but decreases with age. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But don’t get daunted: What Grossman has replicated in her research multiple times over is that 15 minutes a day of strength training is all it takes to elicit real body composition change. This most likely will look like basic exercises that you’re already familiar with: squats, lunges, push-ups and bicep curls are all forms of strength training.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enter the current chatter about weighted vests, often touted as a way for women to get that strength training they need to protect their bone health and build lean muscle mass. But there’s actually really limited research on weighted vests themselves, especially on whether they provide strength training benefits the same way that lifting weights or engaging in even body weight exercises does. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s known so far is that there seem to be &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39525516/"&gt;cardiovascular benefits&lt;/a&gt; from walking with a weighted vest. But a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22338922/"&gt;small study&lt;/a&gt; done by Thai researchers found no difference in bone health between those who walked with weighted vests and those who walked without. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s probably because the best exercises for bone density and lean muscle mass are those that involve executing a full range of body motion while utilizing significant resistance. (Think: a series of lunges while holding hand weights.)&lt;/p&gt;


  







&lt;p&gt;“You have to tug on those muscles in order for the muscles to require that metabolic demand,” Grossman said. “And when I say tug on them, I mean you have to use them. It takes work.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the trick is to &lt;em&gt;keep &lt;/em&gt;using them in this way, even as you continue to age. (Yes, Grossman said — you can definitely be 75 and doing a full body squat. And the best way to ensure that’s possible then? Start practicing now.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, could a weighted vest help with this? Maybe, but the research is far from definitive. And should you buy a weighted vest? Sure, if you want to. But do you need to? Not necessarily. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Grossman also advises some caution: There’s also a risk of injury with weighted vests — whether from strain or loss of balance — especially if people are wearing them while doing other forms of resistance training at a gym with little experience. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So why &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;weighted vests everywhere? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I wanted to unpack what to make of their overwhelming popularity. I called &lt;a href="https://www.newschool.edu/lang/faculty/natalia-mehlman-petrzela/"&gt;Natalia Mehlman Petrzela&lt;/a&gt;, a historian, associate professor at The New School and the author of “&lt;a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/F/bo184287097.html"&gt;Fit Nation: The Gains and Pains of America’s Exercise Obsession&lt;/a&gt;.” She’s a woman in her 40s and so she also sees weighted vests all around her. And when she sees them, she thinks about the ThighMaster. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fitness in the United States “is primarily a marketplace, and there is always a new product being marketed,” she said. Weighted vests are just the latest magic cure for all that ails you as you age — weight gain! loss of bone density! loss of muscle tone! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What feels new, though, is that the product also promises to maximize your productivity. “The fact that a weighted vest is a device that you can just put on when you’re just walking around suggests that just walking around isn’t good enough, that you actually should be optimizing that time on your feet to &lt;em&gt;also &lt;/em&gt;be working out at the same time,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;

                        More From Jennifer Gerson:
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;figure class=""&gt;
                            
                            &lt;/figure&gt;
                                                            &lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li class="ups-block__single-article__item wp-block-single-article-grid__item"&gt;
                
            &lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The immense popularity of weighted vests is also a sign of a change in how society sees middle-aged women.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s this thorny thing happening where there is this shift from seeing women past a certain age as invisible and unattractive and unworthy of any sort of attention to now seeing them as women who can be sexually attractive and have desires and deserve to feel good,” Mehlman Petrzela said. “I think the double-edged sword of that is that there’s this constant pressure to work on yourself and that now, when you’re 55, you actually still have a lot of pressure to look hot and work out all the time and feel great and be working on yourself and not let yourself go — that pressure didn’t exist in, say, 1960 or even 1990.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a whole other weight to carry. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mehlman Petrzela said that when she sees women walking in her neighborhood wearing weighted vests, she commends them on their commitment to caring for themselves and prioritizing health. But also:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It feels a little bit like this Army of Women who are never allowed to stop working on their fitness, even when they’re going about their day. The idea or the reality that we women who are already carrying so much are now carrying an extra burden to do all of that can sometimes feel, well, a little much.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaking of a little much&lt;/strong&gt; … &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a few weeks, we’re going to be talking about something I have been hearing a lot about from my peers IRL: the dynamic of a mother going through perimenopause living in the same household as a daughter going through puberty and what so many hormones under one roof can look and feel like. (I have a middle schooler myself so … yes.) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Is this also you? &lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a0c3cfcdcdd5cec9d4d9e09199d4c8cec5d7d38ecfd2c7"&gt;Please write to me&lt;/a&gt;! I would love to speak with you for this upcoming edition about what you’re experiencing — and what you’re learning about yourself and your child in real time as you change, together. &lt;/p&gt;

So I started to look for a solution to fix that,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael’s girlfriend, Lana, has enjoyed participating in his experiments. “ It’s just very interesting,” she says. “He revealed to me that he was taking his concoction. We experimented with different dosages of everything and saw what that did, so that was kind of cool.” Michael and Lana asked to use pseudonyms to protect their privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lana is not alone among women in preferring more semen. Both Steven and Mike began supplementing after their girlfriends reacted negatively to the small size of their loads. “There are plenty of women who like cum and like to have it on their bodies,” says &lt;em&gt;Good Sex&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74LGNawQJq0&amp;amp;"&gt;Neal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My guess is that the majority of women probably don’t mind having a little bit more ejaculate from their partner,” Neal says. “And I would guess that there’s a not insubstantial subsection of women who actually really would love to have more ejaculate from their partner.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many men find that their partners do not appreciate their newfound talent.

So, this is, I think, a little more selfish.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But achieving more semen volume is more attainable than those other goals. “ It’s so much easier and there’s so much less risk, and quite honestly, it’s a lot cheaper,” Hink says. Ultimately, the desire for a larger load is the desire to satisfy oneself. “It’s the pièce de résistance,” Steven says. “It’s the reward for the job well done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxQcUNsdHhXMnVHQnhadEo0Nl9BUkx0Y0FaQTRJMU1KSEczMnQ2eFltT0kyUkgwdW9pS29zREpiamVzb2xJbXZxcUFyV01CbXl2OVYwNkl4MWRIOXJ5eHFYZkdXRkp4UnlhUWNLTElnaXNnQndYVE96YUNFbHJKdU5kVWlXUHQyajA</guid></item><item><title>日本宣布流感疫情—这对其他国家意味着什么-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03367-z</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03367-z/d41586-025-03367-z_51572084.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03367-z/d41586-025-03367-z_51572084.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="A crowd of mask wearing commuters on a busy street in Osaka City." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03367-z/d41586-025-03367-z_51572084.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Cases of influenza are surging in Japan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Kota Kawasaki/Yomiuri Shimbun via AP/Alamy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan’s health authorities have declared an influenza epidemic, with thousands of people infected with the respiratory virus. The number of infections is unusual for this time of year, researchers say, and could seed outbreaks in countries that are heading into winter in Asia and Europe — although it is unlikely to become a global pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 10 October, 6,013 cases of influenza virus have been reported in Japan. More than 100 schools have closed, and nearly half of the 287 people who were hospitalized for flu in September were children aged 14 or younger. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare declared a nationwide epidemic on 3 October. Outbreaks are classified as epidemics when the number of infections is higher than expected in a given area over a particular period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks of influenza virus tend to occur &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03666-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03666-9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;seasonally each year&lt;/a&gt;, predominantly in winter across countries with temperate climates. In Japan, that usually occurs around the end of November. This year, the increase in people being treated for flu started five weeks earlier than usual, says Vinod Balasubramaniam, a molecular virologist at Monash University Malaysia in Subang Jaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan has had early starts to the flu season in the past few years, but not this early, says Ian Barr, a researcher and deputy director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, who is based in Melbourne, Australia. “You might see cases in October, but not epidemic-type numbers,” says Barr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03519-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03519-3" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Increasing international travel&lt;/a&gt; since the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01315-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01315-9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; is one factor that could be behind the early start to the flu season, says Balasubramaniam. Other factors include climate change and a lack of exposure to the circulating virus, particularly for elderly people and young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information about which strains are circulating in Japan has not yet emerged, but Barr says the outbreaks there could be caused by a strain of influenza A, called H3N2, that surged in Australia and New Zealand over the past two months, coinciding with the end of winter in the Southern Hemisphere. People from Australia are travelling to Japan in huge numbers, he says, meaning there are more chances for virus transmission between hemispheres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

That mix of frustration, disbelief, and just a little bit of amusement? That’s exactly what unfolded in a viral video when one clever rescue Golden Retriever pushed her mom’s patience and ended up leaving thousands of viewers in stitches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Watch rescue Golden Retriever wear mom’s stockings after stealing them in hilarious video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Meet Mango, a rescue &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; who is no stranger to mischief. In a recent viral clip, Mango’s mom shared what happened when her curious pup decided to help herself to a pair of black stockings. Rather than scolding her, Mango’s owner decided to enforce a lighthearted house rule: “You steal it, you wear it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The video opens with Mango proudly holding her mom’s stockings between her paws, looking both guilty and defiant. The on-screen text humorously reads, “Another episode of ‘You steal it, you wear it.’” Moments later, the camera cuts to Mango, who now wears the stockings on her hind legs like a runway model. The sight is both ridiculous and adorable as the fluffy Golden stands confidently, clearly unbothered by her new “outfit.” Her mom jokingly captioned the video, “Girl where did you even find these?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The combination of Mango’s calm demeanor and her unusual outfit had viewers howling with laughter. One user joked, “Wowww we were not prepared for that,” while another encouraged, “Now STRUT your stuff Mango!” Someone else chimed in, “I’m going to go snag something cute right now!!!!” as if inspired to join the trend. Another viewer added, “This needs to come with an NSFW warning,” referencing Mango’s “spicy” runway look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many praised her mom’s lighthearted way of handling a classic case of canine mischief.

Only some groups of &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a34304173/mount-vesuvius-victim-brain-cells-preserved/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain cells;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;brain cells&lt;/a&gt; that are activated during bouts of pain had been identified in the central and peripheral nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, after a series of experiments on mice, biologist Nicholas Betley from the University of Pennsylvania has discovered that a previously overlooked group of &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/animals/a24760/bat-neurons-discovered/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neurons;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;neurons&lt;/a&gt; in the parabrachial nucleus is switched on in individuals with chronic pain. He and his research team also found that there is a molecule that the brain can release for pain relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We focused on the lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPBN), a major entry point of sensory information from the periphery and the first site of integration of many affective behavioral states,” Betley said in a study recently published in the journal &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-09602-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popularmechanics.com%2Fscience%2Fhealth%2Fa69014450%2Fscientists-found-the-potential-off-button-for-stopping-chronic-pain%2F" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nature;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Populations of neurons in the lPBN […] respond to acute [pain-related] stimuli, and prolonged activation of excitatory lPBN neurons can drive a chronic pain-like state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9119955/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:parabrachial nucleus;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;parabrachial nucleus&lt;/a&gt; is made up of different neuron clusters in the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560589/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dorsolateral pons;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dorsolateral pons&lt;/a&gt; of the brainstem. Known as Y1R neurons, they transmit sensory information (such as taste and &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a23834/record-hot-years-could-be-new-normal-by-2025/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:temperature;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;temperature&lt;/a&gt;) in addition to pain, also regulating appetite and threat signals. While Y1R neurons exist in various subpopulations, what they have in common is the expression of receptors for &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00869/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neuropeptide Y or NPY;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;neuropeptide Y or NPY&lt;/a&gt;, which regulates types of brain activity like metabolism, heart rate, immune function, blood pressure, and even stress reduction. Other studies that involved monitoring neural activity and running computer models showed a link to chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Betley and his research team used painful stimuli (such as exposure to a hot surface) to activate Y1R neurons in mice, and as they predicted, the mice showed behaviors associated with persistent &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a33433129/neanderthal-low-pain-tolerance/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pain;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pain&lt;/a&gt;, such as paw licking. When the Y1R neurons were blocked, pain became much less persistent, and the mice only had short pain responses after being exposed to the same stimuli. There was one group of Y1R neurons that stayed active during licking, which suggests that a subpopulation of Y1R neurons is responsible for part of the Y1R response during extended periods of pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Y1R neurons do not directly cause pain, they are thought to be involved in a larger network that is behind painful sensations. The way these neurons are organized allows them to receive sensory inputs, including pain signals sent from the spinal cord, which the neurons then send to multiple regions of the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a69001666/ultrasound-helmet-parkinsons-breakthrough/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain;cpos:12;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something else the researchers wanted to see was whether pain took precedence over survival. They temporarily deprived the mice of food and water and also introduced a frightening stimulus (like the scent of a &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a67955893/early-humans-eaten-by-leopards/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:predator;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;predator&lt;/a&gt;), and when faced with these perceived threats to their survival, the mice experienced significantly less pain. It turned out that production of neuropeptide Y increased in the parabrachial nucleus when the animals were faced with something that could literally mean life or death. Betley’s findings could mean that someday, a drug that signals neurons to produce more NPY could be a viable and safe alternative to painkillers such as opioids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This mechanism is an efficient and tunable system that enables urgent needs to shift brain state away from pain and towards other states that promote &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/math/a29653543/math-zombie-apocalypse/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:survival;cpos:14;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;survival&lt;/a&gt;,” he &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-09602-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popularmechanics.com%2Fscience%2Fhealth%2Fa69014450%2Fscientists-found-the-potential-off-button-for-stopping-chronic-pain%2F" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;cpos:15;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. “Future work could build from these findings to test other endogenous or pharmacological interventions that curb pain state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 13:12:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPc2tlQ0hZTHRDMVJLZmtEb2dpRnAyNFlRSUxoSnVWZk1xeTQ4WDJoS1VJT1Vad2dSQU5MdnNUTWRsTllFUkZ2MzBPTVdPcFVKM2t5YzI4NXBkMldBYy1rWGNqTS1TTXNWZ2s2anMyOUpvMzFheDNrRExFRGlNMklRXzVCQTJSTnFq</guid></item><item><title>简单的脂肪酸可以恢复失败的视力- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251014014307.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;Changes in eyesight are one of the most familiar effects of getting older. Sit in a dim restaurant with someone over 60, and you might hear, "Hold on -- let me pull out my cell phone. I need more light to read the menu!" But what if declining vision with age could actually be reversed?&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at UC Irvine have taken a closer look at that question, investigating a potential treatment aimed at slowing or even undoing "aging" in the eye while also preventing age-related diseases such as macular degeneration (AMD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We show the potential for reversing age-related vision loss," explains Dorota Skowronska-Krawczyk, PhD, an associate professor in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics and the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences. The study, conducted in partnership with scientists from the Polish Academy of Sciences and the Health and Medical University in Potsdam, Germany, presents findings published in &lt;em&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt; under the title "Retinal polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation reverses aging-related vision decline in mice."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding the "Aging" Gene&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research builds on earlier work involving the Elongation of Very Long Chain Fatty Acids Protein 2 (ELOVL2), a well-established biomarker of aging. "We showed that we have lower vision when this ELOVL2 enzyme isn't active," says Skowronska-Krawczyk, who is also part of the Robert M. Brunson Center for Translational Vision Research at the UC Irvine School of Medicine. In that previous study, boosting ELOVL2 activity in aging mice increased levels of the omega−3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the eye and led to better vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new research aimed to find a way to achieve similar benefits without depending on the ELOVL2 enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people age, changes in lipid metabolism reduce the amount of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLC-PUFAs) in the retina. This decline can impair vision and contribute to AMD. The ELOVL2 gene plays a crucial role in producing both VLC-PUFAs and DHA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When researchers injected older mice with a specific polyunsaturated fatty acid, their visual performance improved. "It's a proof-of-concept for turning lipid injection into a possible therapy," says Skowronska-Krawczyk. "What is important is that we didn't see the same effect with DHA." Others have also questioned the ability of DHA to slow AMD progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our work really confirms the fact that DHA alone cannot do the work, but we have this other fatty acid that is seemingly working and improving vision in aged animals," says Skowronska-Krawczyk. "We have also shown on a molecular level that it actually reverses the aging features."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the researchers found genetic variants in the ELOVL2 enzyme that correlate with faster progression of AMD. "Now we actually have a genetic connection to the disease and its aging aspect," says Skowronska-Krawczyk, "so we could potentially identify people at higher risk for vision loss progression." This could lead to not only therapeutic treatment options but also targeted interventions for prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings have only further solidified Skowronska-Krawczyk's view of the importance of the ELOVL2 enzyme. "I am pretty convinced it's one of the top aging genes that we should look at when we think about anti-aging therapies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking Beyond the Retina&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a collaboration with researchers from UC San Diego, Skowronska-Krawczyk has also started to explore the role of lipid metabolism in immune system aging. That study found that the lack of ELOVL2 enzyme induces accelerated aging of immune cells, suggesting that systemic lipid supplementation could potentially counteract the effects of age on the immune system. It also suggested that lipid metabolism might play a role in blood cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our first study explored a potential therapy to address vision loss," says Skowronska-Krawczyk, "but with the information we've since learned about immune aging, we are hopeful the supplementation therapy will boost the immune system as well."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

It's different for all of us and may even differ from day to day. A myriad of factors impact when we eat, from our work schedules to our social calendars and those of our family members. Whether we're eating out, cooking at home, or ordering takeout also can affect our plans. There's also personal preference: Tasting Table surveyed readers on &lt;a href="https://www.tastingtable.com/1158971/what-time-do-you-prefer-to-eat-dinner-exclusive-survey/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the preferred time to eat dinner;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;the preferred time to eat dinner&lt;/a&gt;, and answers ranged from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. But the question remains, is there, in fact, a time we should be aiming for, and how important is a consistent time to our digestion and other health factors? To find out, we consulted an expert, &lt;a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-y4p&amp;amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;amp;contentUuid=8931d6b0-18b1-3310-beb1-fed1c0a43f67&amp;amp;featureId=text-link&amp;amp;linkText=Lena+Bakovic&amp;amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2xldHNsaXZlaXR1cC5jb20vcGFnZXMvbGVuYS1iYWtvdmljIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4OTMxZDZiMC0xOGIxLTMzMTAtYmViMS1mZWQxYzBhNDNmNjciLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vbGV0c2xpdmVpdHVwLmNvbS9wYWdlcy9sZW5hLWJha292aWMifQ&amp;amp;signature=AQAAAUclh73U8Ouz_xwB8vkl0R1XTVfYKsMm5IFTxF7G02w5&amp;amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fletsliveitup.com%2Fpages%2Flena-bakovic&amp;amp;spaceId=980751755" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lena Bakovic;elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Lena Bakovic&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RDN, CNSC at Live It Up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"In my opinion, dinner should ideally be consumed at least two hours prior to bedtime (and sometimes slightly longer, depending on the individual)," Bakovic says. "This strategic timing aids with providing our digestive systems sufficient time to digest and absorb nutrients, while also helping to prevent symptoms of reflux or negatively impacting sleep." If your body hasn't had ample time to digest when you lie down, it could result in stomach pains, heartburn, and acid reflux. Plus, the calories that your body would normally convert into fuel during the day just get stored as fat if you're about to go to bed. This can lead to weight gain, while acid reflux can accumulate into long-term issues like asthma and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Read more: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/10-foods-gordon-ramsay-doesnt-122000054.html" data-ylk="slk:10 Foods Gordon Ramsay Doesn't Touch;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;10 Foods Gordon Ramsay Doesn't Touch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How late is too late for dinner?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woman eating spaghetti at table - D3sign/Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That potential indigestion-related discomfort, Bakovic says, "may, in some respects, be due to the metabolic activity required to digest and absorb food." She explains, "Eating too late can also alter hormonal balance, namely insulin levels, unusually affecting blood sugar ebbs and flows." Insulin is the hormone that turns sugar into energy; it's receptive in the morning to get you ready for the day but not so much at night. Hormones that regulate your appetite and your metabolism follow your circadian rhythm, so if you push against this by eating when your body thinks it's time for bed, the way your body generates energy and feels hungry and full gets thrown off. This could lead to health issues like type 2 diabetes down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, that doesn't mean you have to eat at 5 p.m. if you go to bed at 9:30 p.m. "Eating dinner too early can set us up to eat more food later, in larger portions, and in late evenings or close to bedtime," Bakovic adds. Overcorrecting can just land you back in the position of needing to eat another meal later. The right dinnertime is about balance. This can take dedicated scheduling, but the health benefits are worthwhile. "Generally speaking, smaller and more frequent meals are usually quite easier to digest," the expert adds, "which can help with stabilizing energy levels." Flexibility is key in the long run, as we all know the day can get away from us.

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Seafood&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Generally, the health benefits of fish make certain types of seafood worth the higher price. “Consuming two servings of fish per week has been shown to help lower the risk of heart disease,” says Amy Woodman, owner and dietitian at Farmington Valley Nutrition and Wellness in Simsbury, Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Salmon, in particular, is rich in &lt;a href="/health/healthy-living/foods-high-in-omega-fatty-acids/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/money/personal-finance/2025/splurging-on-groceries.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP.

A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="dementia warning signs"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;. If you can afford it, Lupoli recommends buying wild-caught rather than farm-raised. “They are leaner and have more nutrients,” she says. “They’re just healthier fish. Because they are healthier, they are healthier for our bodies.”&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Wild salmon also has fewer calories, one-third the saturated fat of farmed salmon and fewer contaminants.﻿&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pro tip: &lt;/b&gt;Buying frozen fish rather than fresh can save you money, Sauceda says. Canned fish is also a more affordable option.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Nuts and seeds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/health/healthy-living/nuts-and-seeds-for-brain-health/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/money/personal-finance/2025/splurging-on-groceries.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP.

            &lt;p&gt;You’ll get the most nutritional bang for your buck with almonds, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, pecans and walnuts, according to the Mayo Clinic. Cashews and pistachios are also good options, Lupoli says. Choose raw and dry-roasted nuts instead of those cooked in oil.﻿&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Seeds, such as chia seeds, flax seeds and sunflower seeds, are a good source of protein﻿, fiber and omega-3 fatty acids, according to Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pro tip: &lt;/b&gt;When it comes to nuts and seeds, a little goes a long way, which can help keep costs — and calories — down. Eating a small handful of nuts a few times a week will provide health benefits, Lupoli says. And just a tablespoon of seeds per day offers a wealth of nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Protein supplements&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Protein is essential for &lt;a href="/health/healthy-living/foods-to-preserve-muscle-mass/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/money/personal-finance/2025/splurging-on-groceries.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP.

A &lt;a href="/videos/health/63757699441120/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/money/personal-finance/2025/splurging-on-groceries.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="how to eat more protein"&gt;high-protein diet&lt;/a&gt; also can help prevent spikes in blood sugar, Lupoli says. However, more than 1 in 3 adults ages 51 and older aren’t getting enough protein in their diets, according to research published in &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Journal of Nutrition, Health and Aging&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;If you’re adding protein to your diet through &lt;a href="/health/drugs-supplements/top-protein-powder/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/money/personal-finance/2025/splurging-on-groceries.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="top protein powders"&gt;protein powders&lt;/a&gt;, Lupoli recommends spending more for high-quality options. Look for protein supplements that don’t have added sugars or sweeteners, artificial flavors and colors, or lots of additives. Generally, the fewer the ingredients, the better. Johns Hopkins Medicine has a &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/-/media/bariatrics/nutrition-suggested-protein-supplements.pdf" target="_blank" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/money/personal-finance/2025/splurging-on-groceries.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP.

&lt;p&gt;Some videos don’t need context, backstory, or fancy editing. They just need one fluffy puppy, who serves as a few seconds of pure serotonin. That’s exactly what happens in this Instagram Reel by @poppi.the.golden.girl. In the now-viral video, &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; puppy Poppi is casually sitting inside an orange cooking pot. It looks like the coziest bed she’s ever known.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pups all but need to breathe for people to fawn over their cuteness. Poppi’s funny little head tilts, button eyes, and one paw resting dramatically on the rim are the kind of “too cute to function” moments that make 135K people stop mid-scroll for their hearts to melt a little.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-golden-retriever-puppy-looks-so-happy-while-sitting-in-a-pot"&gt;Golden Retriever puppy looks so happy while sitting in a pot&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The video of the Golden Retriever puppy in a pot doesn’t capture much — and that’s the magic of it. It opens with Poppi just chilling. The in-video text reads, “Send this to someone who needs to see a puppy in a pot,” which feels less like a suggestion and more like a public service announcement. One person in the comments section even sent it to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the clip, Poppi tilts her head, shifts her paw, blinks up at the camera, and the internet collectively loses its mind over the cuteness overload. The pup’s mom captioned it: “How can one thing be this cute?” And most are left asking the same question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It helps that Poppi’s not an only child — she recently joined big sister Pearl, having &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/186109-golden-retriever-emotions-meeting-sister-first-time-video"&gt;met her for the first time&lt;/a&gt; just a few months back. Their mom joked that it’s now “double love, double trouble, double vacuuming,” but it is all “worth it.” Sounds about right for life with Goldens — a glorious mix of chaos, hair, and heart-melting sweetness that passes way too fast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The comments section is full of people who are replaying this clip again and again. One person alliterated, “Poppi the Puppy in a Pot.” Another said, “Well, aren’t you just the most precious little beautiful puppy.” One also commented, “Awww the cutest little potato and little soul of a darling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK — Americans headed to pharmacies for covid-19 vaccines are running into roadblocks and confusion due to new U.S. guidance that abandoned broad support for the shots, contributing to the lowest vaccination rates since they were introduced.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the four-week period ended Oct. 3, covid immunizations were down about 25% nationally, according to IQVIA data in analysts’ research notes.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steven Thompson, a 41-year-old financial professional from Salt Lake City, routinely gets the covid shot through employer-sponsored health insurance. In September, he was told at a Walgreens pharmacy he needed a prescription. Utah, Georgia and Louisiana had been requiring prescriptions while awaiting CDC guidance on who should get the shot.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson’s children’s pediatrician just sent prescriptions to Walgreens. His doctor required a visit.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hate going to the doctor or doing any activity where I don’t know how much it’ll cost,” said Thompson, who now doesn’t plan to get a shot unless local infection rates rise.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;States add to confusion&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah authorized pharmacists to provide the shot in late September without prescriptions, while Georgia and Louisiana dropped the requirement early this month. A Walgreens spokesperson said patients no longer need a prescription.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since their mid-pandemic introduction, covid shots have been recommended for anyone in the U.S. who wanted one. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention withdrew that broad support, calling for consultation with a healthcare provider first.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move came after the FDA approved updated shots only for people aged 65 and over and those at risk of severe disease. The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA and CDC, is now led by longtime anti-vaccine campaigner Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadia Hicks, a 31-year-old communications manager from Atlanta, was surprised to learn she needed a prescription to receive the vaccine last month at a Publix pharmacy. Hicks, who has asthma, consulted her doctor for one.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s causing a lot of anxiety because I think the less information we have, the harder it is to know… is it necessary to get the vaccine now?” she said, adding she did not receive the usual immunization notice from her healthcare system.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Publix spokesperson said its pharmacies can now give covid shots in Georgia without a prescription.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health insurers rely on CDC guidelines, informed by recommendations from its outside expert advisers, to set their vaccine coverage terms.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy gutted that advisory group and replaced it with hand-picked members, many of whom share his controversial vaccine views. As a result, some states said they now questioned the scientific basis for CDC guidance and began setting their own policies. Major insurers have said they will provide coverage for the vaccine through 2026.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People hear about the FDA, the CDC, their health department; there’s lots of different discussions about what is actually the recommendation,” said Dr. Aaron Milstone, a pediatric infectious disease expert at Johns Hopkins Health System in Baltimore.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;U.S. vaccination rates higher than other wealthy nations&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most European countries, Canada and Australia, covid vaccine guidance was already limited to older adults and those at high risk of severe covid.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The midpoint of vaccination rates for adults over 60 in the 21 European Union countries was 8.7% from August 2024 to March 2025, according to the European CDC, well below the 2024 U.S. rate among adults of around 23%, according to CDC data.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covid hospitalizations continue to present a burden on health systems, said Jodie Guest, an epidemiology professor at Emory University.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The science shows us very clearly how important these vaccines are to keep you individually safe, but also those around you who are in the very high-risk groups,” she said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CVS Health Chief Medical Officer Amy Compton-Phillips said in an interview that demand for covid and flu shots has been lower than last year.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a little challenging at the moment, because consumers are looking for organizations they can trust,” she said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which operates one of the nation’s largest pharmacy chains, said it is providing the shots nationwide without a prescription.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, with German partner BioNTech, and Moderna make covid shots based on messenger RNA technology, the safety of which Kennedy and allies have questioned, contrary to scientific evidence. Novavax and French partner Sanofi sell a more traditional vaccine.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The delay in official CDC guidance on updated shots following the FDA’s more limited approval created confusion among consumers and independent pharmacies, which make up about one-third of U.S. pharmacies.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roger Paganelli, a pharmacist at Mt. Carmel Pharmacy in New York City, said many pharmacists are wary of promoting vaccines for patients not approved by the FDA, and that some worry insurers may refuse to cover them.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others are concerned they would lose legal protection that shields them from patient lawsuits, said Paganelli, a past president at Pharmacists Society of the State of New York who plans to continue offering the vaccine.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three pharmacy experts said CDC guidance to consult with patients acts as a barrier to uptake, especially for low-income populations in underserved areas who rely on walk-in immunizations where counseling is impractical.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As far as the mass clinics, pharmacies are only offering the influenza vaccine,” said Dr. Allison Hill, a director at the American Pharmacists Association, “because over the past weeks we’ve gone back and forth with covid-19 policy.”

&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The majority of his life was spent in the countryside, eluding urban air pollution. From 1956, however, he worked for a major company in crop protection and was, naturally, exposed to a variety of pesticides and farming chemicals. Could these have been the trigger? Curious, I approached Sonia Gandhi, a professor of neurology at University College London (UCL) and an assistant research director at the biomedicine charity the Francis Crick Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is understood that pesticides are included in the environmental factors linked to Parkinson’s disease, but it is not yet apparent whether they affect DLB. Gandhi states, however, that environmental toxins may play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pesticides affect the mitochondria of cells, causing a decline in the energy production – this is believed then to cause a bioenergetic deficit that puts the brain cells in a ‘stressed’ state in which proteins such as alpha-synuclein may misfold,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We cannot be certain that pesticides are the culprit for Grandpa’s DLB, or whether it is even possible for them to have been a catalyst decades before his diagnosis, but current work seeks to decipher the how and why of our environment’s role in neurodegenerative diseases. We may never know in Grandpa’s case, but there is hope for future patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, researchers from the Francis Crick Institute and UCL launched an ongoing project named Role of Air Pollution in Dementia (Rapid), which aims to uncover the specific process(es) of and conditions for PM2.5 to incite neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gandhi says: “Our work in Rapid is designed to examine a range of different hypotheses about how PM2.5 may affect brain health. What is clearly needed, though, is research that can understand the route of exposure, the timing and duration of exposures, the effect of combinations of exposures – as this is what happens in the ‘real world’ – and the actual mechanisms by which either pesticides or air pollution, or both, may affect the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For air pollution, we do not yet know the exact mechanisms – it may affect states of inflammation within the brain, or it may interact directly with the protein alpha-synuclein to change its propensity to aggregate or cause neurodegeneration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How PM2.5 triggers &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/dementia/midlife-medications-dementia/"&gt;neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/a&gt; is not yet determined, but what&lt;em&gt; is&lt;/em&gt; clear is that air quality, which is already linked to numerous chronic conditions, must be improved. Some pollution is unavoidable. We can’t put lids on volcanoes or snuff out every spore-spurting plant. But we do have the capacity to manage PM2.5 produced by human activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2010 sets legal limits for particulate matter concentrations to regulate our exposure to PM2.5, while the National Emission Ceilings Regulations 2018 places legal caps on air-pollutant emissions. Environmental policies must now consider the implications of this new research in neuroscience and make amendments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The idea that we may be able to prevent or delay the onset of a condition by changing our environment – this opens a new door in conditions that currently lack cure/disease-modifying therapies,” says Gandhi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weil comments: “This is an important and exciting research finding. It is important to find a potential cause for Lewy body dementia, and finding this link could provide a potential new avenue for treatments, which is what all the patients in my clinic are eager to see.”&lt;/p&gt;

His goldfish had died the year before. Their dog Copper had passed away a month earlier, and his mother Tricia Reagan tried to explain that the same thing happened to his half sister Sarah. But Copper had lived to 105 in dog years. Sarah Saponara was just 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;His mother said his sister took medication that wasn’t hers. It had dangerous stuff in it, and it made her die. Death, she explained, meant he wouldn’t see Sarah again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Two years passed before Miles and Tricia really talked about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; she died again. It would come up randomly — at the grocery store, the park and the zoo: “Tell me how Sarah died."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As Miles grew older, he had more questions: &lt;em&gt;Where did Sarah get the medicine? Did the doctor give it to her? Could all medicines hurt you? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Sibling grief is real and powerful, but it's often overlooked, especially when the grieving sibling is a young child. In the age of widespread access to drugs like fentanyl, overdose deaths have become a heartbreaking reality for more families. For parents, that means facing the impossible task of helping their young kids make sense of loss far too early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/13/USAT/86677445007-img-6643-copy-2.jpeg?width=960&amp;amp;height=958&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt="Sarah Saponara was 21 when she died of overdose after taking a counterfeit Percocet laced with fentanyl.

She started seeking out other drugs to capture that same feeling. At first it was weed, then ketamine and Xanax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She struggled with bipolar disorder and ADHD, but when she was on drugs, she felt like her brain was balanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;By the time Sarah went to college, she didn’t have a drug of choice, but she was addicted to being in an altered state. She ended up dropping out after four semesters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;On an acid trip, she once threw herself out of a moving car on the highway. That was one of the times Tricia felt like she might lose her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Sarah’s addiction uprooted their lives. If Tricia had 100 metaphorical marbles to give to other people, she gave 96 of them to Sarah. At one point, Tricia was worried the person selling Sarah drugs would come to their house, and she sent Liliana, her then-13-year-old middle child, to go live with an uncle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The panic attacks, anxiety and anger hit Liliana in waves: &lt;em&gt;How could Sarah afford drugs, but not food? Why did she keep using? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It took years for her to truly understand the ways addiction had taken control of Sarah’s actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It was really heartbreaking to have to experience Sarah be so dismissive,” Liliana, now 18, says, “There was a lot of anger when she died.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Though they didn’t know the name for it at the time, they were experiencing anticipatory grief — the process of grieving a future loss, which can involve feelings of anxiety, sadness and anger. With overdose-specific loss, those feelings are often more complicated and grouped with the stigma of losing someone to substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It wasn't until after she died that I could say, we went through something horrific,” Tricia says. “It was freaking terrible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/13/USAT/86667389007-img-3271.jpeg?crop=3024,3549,x0,y356&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;height=353&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/13/USAT/86667389007-img-3271.jpeg?crop=3024,3549,x0,y356&amp;amp;width=600&amp;amp;height=706&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Sarah was the oldest of three siblings.

She was with her girlfriend and their roommate. Just hours after snorting the drug, Sarah awoke to find her girlfriend unresponsive beside her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Tricia got the call in the middle of the night: They were at the hospital, and Sarah's girlfriend was dead. She stayed by her daughter’s side. During a brief break to take a conference call, Tricia left the apartment. When she returned with lunch and knocked on Sarah's roommate's door, there was no answer. She and Sarah found him dead, too. A fatal overdose from the same batch of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Later, Sarah admitted they'd known the heroin had killed her girlfriend but had both used it again anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I couldn't understand why she would do that,” Tricia says. “From a distance, it's clear to me that substances have a power that I do not understand…. Her brain was no longer able to process it in a rational way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Six months later, Sarah was gone. She never forgave herself for surviving that tragedy, her mom says. She overdosed at least twice and was in the ER just three days before her death. What eventually killed her on Feb. 17, 2021, was a counterfeit Percocet, laced with fentanyl. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In that final year of Sarah’s life, Tricia hardly slept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Every morning, she checked Sarah’s location and social media. If too many hours went by without hearing from her, Tricia would drive by her apartment, heart racing, to check she was there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Even though she’d imagined the ways Sarah could die thousands of times, nothing compared to the wall of grief that hit her when it actually happened. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Sarah had been the soundtrack to their lives. She played 17 instruments. At her rural conservative high school in Ashland, Virginia, she was the first openly gay member of the homecoming court and was voted class clown. When she died, it was like the music stopped. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Tricia wanted to collapse, but she had two other kids to raise. The fear was paralyzing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“One of the hardest things about parenting, when you've lost a kid to overdose, was (thinking) what role did I play in getting Sarah to where she was? And how can I make sure I don't make that same decision with my other children?" Tricia says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Liliana, seven years younger than Sarah, had memories.

It was her sister’s. Sarah had once nearly been struck by lightning, and that Christmas, Tricia got her the lamp and a bracelet with a poem that read: "Believe me when I tell you that girls like you are made of lightning — hard to forget and remembered by all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There are often feelings of anger, regret and guilt that come with the loss of a loved one to overdose, and it’s important to seek out overdose-specific grief resources.

It finds its own quiet places to live. In the corner of their kitchen, there’s a small space that Miles calls “Sarah’s house.” Over the years, he’s filled it with little things for her: a few photos from family trips, small toys, and, one Christmas, a tiny doll bed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“She needs a bed in her house,” he told Tricia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She smiled and asked gently, “Do you think she sleeps there?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Miles shook his head. “No,” he said. “She’s in the stars.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you or someone you love is struggling with a substance use disorder contact the &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/helplines/national-helpline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;SAMHSA National Helpline&lt;/a&gt; at 1-800-662-HELP (4357) for information and resources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rachel Hale’s role covering Youth Mental Health at USA TODAY is supported by a partnership with Pivotal and Journalism Funding Partners.

  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;A Washington man appeared to be destined to develop &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nervous-system-health/alzheimers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; — but against all genetic odds, he has eluded the common dementia for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;Researchers at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis recently published a study focusing on Doug Whitney, 76, who lives near Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has a rare inherited &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/genetics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;genetic mutation&lt;/a&gt; in the presenilin 2 (PSEN2) gene, which virtually guarantees early-onset Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/study-reveals-why-super-agers-maintain-outstanding-memory-80s" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;STUDY REVEALS WHY ‘SUPER AGERS’ MAINTAIN ‘OUTSTANDING MEMORY’ INTO THEIR 80S&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of Whitney’s family members who inherited the gene have experienced cognitive decline starting in their early 50s or sooner, according to a WashU press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitney, however, shows no signs of mental decline. WashU researchers wondered if the reason for his continued cognitive health could help protect others against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doug Whitney, Alzheimer's research participant, appeared to be destined to develop Alzheimer’s disease — but against all genetic odds, he has eluded the common dementia for decades.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(UWash Medicine/Megan Farmer)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in the journal Nature Medicine, the researchers analyzed his genetic data and brain scans, identifying "changes in genes and proteins" that could explain how he has defied the odds to remain &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;mentally sharp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also discovered that Whitney’s brain had virtually no buildup of tau, the hallmark protein that signals the onset of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/new-mri-brain-scan-predicts-alzheimers-risk-years-before-symptoms-develop" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;NEW MRI BRAIN SCAN PREDICTS ALZHEIMER'S RISK YEARS BEFORE SYMPTOMS DEVELOP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These extensive studies indicate a remarkable resistance to tau pathology and neurodegeneration," said senior study author Randall J. Bateman, M.D., the Charles F. and Joanne Knight Distinguished Professor of Neurology at WashU Medicine, in the press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urged by his cousin, Whitney first came to WashU in 2011 to participate in a study focused on families with inherited forms of Alzheimer’s, as many of his relatives had developed early-onset disease. At the time, he believed he did not have the gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;&lt;p class="quote-text"&gt;"He actually was able to escape the expected course of the disease."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitney’s mother was one of 14 children, nine of whom had the Alzheimer’s gene. Ten of them died before they were 60. Whitney’s own brother developed the disease before dying at age 55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was 61 at the time — well past the age where it should have onset," he told Fox News Digital during an on-camera interview. "But they tested me, and lo and behold, I did have the gene. I was amazed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a study published in the journal Nature Medicine, the researchers analyzed Whitney's genetic data and brain scans.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(UWash Medicine/Megan Farmer)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were just as "confounded," Whitney recalled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;tested me&lt;/a&gt; three times to make sure that there wasn't some slip-up. But it's true. I had the gene. And now I'm 76 years old and still haven't had any symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive clues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jorge Llibre-Guerra, M.D., an assistant professor of neurology and co-first author of the study, echoed that it was a "big surprise" to learn that Whitney was a carrier of the genetic mutation — officially known as an "exceptional resilience mutation carrier."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He actually was able to escape the expected course of the disease," he said in the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/omega-3-may-help-protect-women-from-alzheimers-disease-new-study-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;OMEGA-3 MAY HELP TO PROTECT WOMEN FROM ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE, NEW STUDY SAYS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, in this most recent study, the WashU researchers aimed to explore potential reasons for Whitney’s absence of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we are able to uncover the mechanism behind this resilience, we could try to replicate it with a targeted therapy designed to delay or prevent the onset of Alzheimer’s, leveraging the same &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;protective factors&lt;/a&gt; that have kept Mr. Whitney from developing this disease to benefit others," said Llibre-Guerra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doug and Ione Whitney often work on puzzles together to help maintain mental sharpness.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(UWash Medicine/Megan Farmer)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who have the PSEN2 mutation tend to have an "over-production" of amyloid protein, which &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/brain-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;builds up in the brain&lt;/a&gt; during the first stage of Alzheimer’s, according to the researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second stage, as symptoms of cognitive decline begin, there is typically a buildup of tau protein in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/missing-link-alzheimers-disease-found-study-human-brain-tissue" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;'MISSING LINK' TO ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE FOUND IN STUDY OF HUMAN BRAIN TISSUE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Whitney’s case, brain scans showed a "significant accumulation" of amyloid, but almost a complete absence of tau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One theory for how Whitney may have escaped his genetic fate stems from his time &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/navy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in the Navy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers discovered that Whitney’s brain (not pictured) had virtually no buildup of tau, the hallmark protein that signals the onset of cognitive decline.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers analyzed Whitney’s cerebrospinal fluid, they found a "a significantly higher-than-normal level" of "heat shock" proteins, protective molecules that cells produce when they’re under stress, including &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/heat-wave" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;high heat exposure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his many years of working as a shipboard mechanic in the Navy, Whitney was exposed to high temperatures for extended periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/dementia-risk-slashed-one-common-health-intervention-study-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;DEMENTIA RISK SLASHED WITH ONE COMMON HEALTH INTERVENTION, STUDY FINDS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the engine room of ships, the temperatures … would range from 100 to 110 degrees, for four hours at a time," he told Fox News Digital. "They concluded that possibly there was some gene or protein that could mutate and protect me genetically from the disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don’t yet understand how or if heat shock proteins may be mediating the effect," Llibre-Guerra noted in the release. "However, in this case, they may be involved in preventing aggregation and misfolding of tau proteins, but we do not know for sure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"They tested me three times to make sure that there wasn't some slip-up.

And that’s for something as low stakes as a vitamin D supplement; it’s not the end of the world if I’m a little deficient. But when it comes to HIV prevention, missing a dose of your prescribed daily prevention pills could mean the difference between protection and new infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A new drug called lenacapavir might entirely change the game, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Right now, our most widely used tool to stave off HIV — which &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet"&gt;killed an estimated 630,000 people&lt;/a&gt; last year — is through prevention pills, called pre-exposure prophylaxis. PrEP works extremely well and has prevented millions of HIV infections in the 13 years it’s been around. But the catch is that it needs to be taken every single day. In much of the Global South, having &lt;a href="https://www.prepwatch.org/resources/getting-prep-rollout-right/"&gt;consistent access to it remains a big hurdle&lt;/a&gt;, on top of issues with adherence and stigma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That’s the reason why, by 2023, only about 6 million people worldwide were on PrEP, a fraction of the tens of millions who could benefit. Each year, another 1.3 million people still acquire HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But a discreet shot taken &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; twice a year, like the newly approved lenacapavir, takes forgetfulness — and some stigma — out of the equation. For a field where breakthroughs have been rare, lenacapavir has almost vaccine-like efficacy (even though it’s not one). In clinical trials, the drug showed 100 percent protection in women and approximately 96 percent in men, transgender and nonbinary people. Those are the kind of numbers policymakers can’t ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The US Food and Drug Administration approved it in June, the World Health Organization endorsed it in July, and the European Union followed in August. And the Trump administration — which &lt;a href="/future-perfect/397399/usaid-omb-purge-government-agency-spending-leave"&gt;grounded its live-saving global health work to a complete stop&lt;/a&gt; eight months ago — has recently made lenacapavir the center of its “&lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/America-First-Global-Health-Strategy-Report.pdf"&gt;America First&lt;/a&gt;” global health strategy. The administration plans to roll out the drug in about a dozen low-income countries by early 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That’s all remarkable news. Low-income countries typically have had to wait decades, if not more, before newer, better drugs trickled down. This time, at least in theory, access could come almost simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But whether lenacapavir actually makes a dent in the HIV epidemic will depend less on science than on politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;AIDS-related deaths have dropped dramatically since 2005, in large part because of PEPFAR.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Council on Foreign Relations&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Four decades ago, an HIV infection was a near-death sentence. But since then, we’ve marched toward progress — making better drugs with simpler regimens and widening access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But even after all that work, we still don’t have a cure or a true vaccine. That’s why an innovation like lenacapavir feels notable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For years, HIV drugs targeted the virus’s enzymes, and it wasn’t obvious that targeting anything else would work. Then in the 1990s, researchers backed by the National Institutes of Health began studying how the virus builds its cone-shaped shell, called the capsid. Most &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/23/fda-approval-lenacapavir-yeztugo-gilead-history-development-breakthrough-william-pao/"&gt;scientists dismissed it&lt;/a&gt; as “undruggable” — a smooth protein structure with no obvious place for a medicine to stick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But a small band of virologists thought differently. They spent years hunting for a molecule that could jam the capsid’s formation. After countless dead ends, that hunch paid off: The work led to lenacapavir, the first drug to successfully attack the virus’s shell and block multiple steps in its life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;“This drug is extraordinary — the closest thing to a vaccine that we have.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z3"&gt;— Dr. Megan Ranney, Yale School of Public Health dean&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In a landmark clinical trial that began in 2021 and enrolled more than 2,000 teen girls and young women from South Africa and Uganda, no one who received lenacapavir contracted HIV. The effect was so striking that, in June 2024, an independent safety board told researchers to end the trial’s blinded phase early — continuing would’ve meant withholding an obviously effective drug from some participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“It would’ve been unethical not to,” said Linda-Gail Bekker, an infectious disease physician at the University of Cape Town and one of the trial’s lead investigators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Those numbers are really impressive, but lenacapavir’s efficacy as an injectable is another plus. In much of sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV burden is among the heaviest, injectable contraception is already the most widely used form of birth control. For many women, injections are more discreet and practical than taking a daily pill. “It’s a very recognized concept…injections are a very attractive option,” Bekker said. That familiarity could be the difference between a prevention tool that works in theory and one people actually use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As lenacapavir emerged from late-stage trials, with results showing near-perfect protection, the world took notice. In 2024, the editors of &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, the prestigious scientific journal, named lenacapavir their &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/breakthrough-2024#section_breakthrough"&gt;breakthrough of the year&lt;/a&gt;. “This drug is extraordinary — the closest thing to a vaccine that we have,” said Dr. Megan Ranney, the dean of the Yale School of Public Health and one of the &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; editors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A twice-yearly shot that can nearly eliminate new infections should be the stuff of celebration. Lenacapavir could mark the beginning of the end of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But as always in public health, the science is only half the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A breakthrough only matters if it gets off the shelf and reaches the people who need it most. And in much of the world, that depends on policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Since 2003, the US &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/pepfar/"&gt;President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief&lt;/a&gt;, or PEPFAR, has been an essential, global lever for HIV treatment access. PEPFAR is a George W. Bush-era program that has delivered lifesaving HIV treatment to poor countries and has &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/about-us-pepfar"&gt;helped save more than 25 million lives&lt;/a&gt; over its 22-year history. The program is funded by the US Congress, which renews its authority and budget — both of which can get caught up in politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;When President Donald Trump returned to office in January, he ordered a &lt;a href="/future-perfect/402944/pepfar-hiv-donald-trump-elon-musk-global-health"&gt;broad freeze on US foreign aid, throwing PEPFAR into limbo&lt;/a&gt;. Grants were halted, drug shipments stalled and USAID — the program’s main implementer — was dismantled almost overnight, stoking fears that the world’s most successful HIV program was about to be killed off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Then last month, the administration announced its &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/releases/the-united-states-presidents-emergency-plan-for-aids-relief/2025/09/pepfar-commits-to-distributing-breakthrough-hiv-drug-lenacapavir-demonstrating-american-excellence-in-science-and-american-leadership-in-hiv-prevention"&gt;plans to revive PEPFAR&lt;/a&gt; to deliver the breakthrough drug lenacapavir. (But right now, it’s unclear how the ongoing government shutdown will affect PEPFAR funding.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The administration says it will prioritize delivering lenacapavir to pregnant and breastfeeding people in eight to 12 yet-to-be-announced countries, as part of Trump’s push to &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/09/department-of-state-gilead-sciences-and-the-global-fund-announcement-of-lifesaving-and-innovative-pepfar-initiative/"&gt;end mother-to-child transmission of HIV&lt;/a&gt; by the end of his term. On paper, that’s a tidy goal — two injections can protect both mother and baby through pregnancy and nursing — but advocates say that choice isn’t rooted in science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In sub-Saharan Africa, young women, broadly, account for the majority of new infections, and elsewhere, it’s gay and bisexual men, trans people, sex workers, and people who use drugs — those who were disproportionately infected and died in the early decades of the HIV epidemic. Now, channeling the new drug only through maternal health programs risks leaving those communities out yet again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Prioritizing pregnant and breastfeeding people is ideological, not scientific,” said Asia Russell of &lt;a href="https://healthgap.org/"&gt;HealthGAP&lt;/a&gt;, a New York City-based AIDS advocacy organization. “They’re a very, very small fraction of those at risk.” In sub-Saharan Africa, pregnant and breastfeeding people face real risk — a few out of every hundred contract HIV each year — but they’re still a small slice of a larger epidemic that’s largely driven by young women and queer men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Patients wait to be seen at the maternal and child health unit at Kuoyo Sub-county Hospital in Kisumu, Kenya — a region with one of the highest HIV rates in the country. Clinics like this have been hit hard by recent US aid freezes, leaving gaps in care and prevention.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Michel Lunanga/Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;State Department official Jeremy Lewin also made their philosophy clear during the administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/09/department-of-state-gilead-sciences-and-the-global-fund-announcement-of-lifesaving-and-innovative-pepfar-initiative"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt;. “There are no NGOs involved in this — none of those sort of beltway bandits here,” he said, referring to the aid groups that have traditionally implemented US-funded HIV programs. (It’s a loaded term and a misleading one, given that &lt;a href="https://www.stateoig.gov/uploads/report/report_pdf_file/fy-2024-coordinated-pepfar-oversight-plan.pdf"&gt;oversight bodies&lt;/a&gt; haven’t uncovered corruption at scale.) “It’s going to be the countries [who are] responsible for distributing it through their national healthcare systems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That might sound efficient in Washington, but it’s more complicated on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That’s because HIV isn’t like cholera or the flu — something you can beat with a one-size-fits-all campaign. It affects some groups more than others and carries deep stigma, because it’s tied to sex, sexuality, and drug use, all of which are moralized in many societies. And in many countries, the state is the very institution that enforces, even criminalizes, that stigma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Bekker, who runs an HIV research center in South Africa, said that even in places without formal bans, public clinics can feel hostile to sexual and gender minorities. “The result,” she said, “is that people just don’t show up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://files.kff.org/attachment/Issue-Brief-Key-Issues-and-Questions-for-PEPFARs-Future.pdf"&gt;PEPFAR’s own history&lt;/a&gt; shows that prevention works best when community-led groups such as LGBTQ+ clinics or drop-in centers are included in the response. Those are the spaces that reach groups left out by official systems. Jirair Ratevosian, a former senior PEPFAR adviser, said ending infant infections is crucial, but so is supporting community- and faith-based clinics “where people actually feel safe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Gilead Sciences, headquartered in Foster City, California, developed lenacapavir — the twice-yearly HIV prevention shot now at the center of the US rollout.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Besides the Trump administration (and all its political theater), there’s one more key player: Gilead Sciences, the California-based company that developed lenacapavir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In September, Gilead made two big promises. First, it agreed to sell lenacapavir to PEPFAR at “&lt;a href="https://www.gilead.com/news/news-details/2025/gilead-announces-partnership-with-pepfar-to-deliver-twice-yearly-lenacapavir-for-hiv-prevention-for-up-to-two-million-people-in-primarily-low--and-lower-middle-income-countries"&gt;no profit&lt;/a&gt;,” although it’s unclear what that actually means. Second — and more importantly — it signed licensing deals with six generic manufacturers, sharing its technology so those companies can start preparing to make cheaper versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Typically, drug companies fiercely guard new medicines under patents for 20 years, during which time they alone can make and sell the drugs — and only countries that can afford the list price get access. Once those patents expire, generics can enter the market and drive costs down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;By making these licensing deals, Gilead is trying to shorten that wait time so, if all goes to plan, poorer countries could get lenacapavir in just a few years instead of decades later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The licensing deal allows generics to be sold in 120 low- and lower-middle-income countries, covering most of the world’s poorest nations. Once those versions hit the market, they’ll cost a fraction of Gilead’s price tag — which in the US is $28,128 a year per patient, though few people pay that sticker price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But the deal leaves out many upper-middle-income countries such as Brazil or Argentina, where infections have been rising. Those nations fall into a gray zone — too rich for cheap generics, too poor to afford Gilead’s prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For Gilead, a for-profit company, sharing its drug formula with generic makers might sound generous, but it’s not as straightforward as it looks. The licenses “carve the world into low-value markets where generics can operate [where Gilead won’t be making money anyway], and profitable ones where Gilead keeps its grip,” said Tahir Amin, an intellectual-property lawyer and co-founder of &lt;a href="https://www.i-mak.org/"&gt;Initiative for Medicines, Access, and Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit that advocates for patent reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Meanwhile, major philanthropists — the &lt;a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/media-center/press-releases/2025/09/hiv-prevention-lenacapavir"&gt;Gates Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://unitaid.org/news-blog/lenacapavir-for-hiv-prevention/"&gt;Unitaid, Clinton Health Access Initiative, and Wits RHI&lt;/a&gt; — are doing their part to help generics reach the market faster. They’re backing two Indian generic manufacturers with funding and technical support to help scale production so that low-cost versions of the drug are available by 2027. If that works, it would cost just $40 per person per year — roughly what daily oral PrEP costs today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If that happens — that is &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; we’re able to make cheaper generics faster, roll them out equitably, and deliver them where people feel safe — lenacapavir could make a real dent in the HIV epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;Breakthrough science doesn’t guarantee a breakthrough in public health.

Mitochondria are bean-shaped organelles that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03646-1" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03646-1" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;power cells&lt;/a&gt; and have myriad other cellular tasks. Exploring their DNA is essential for understanding the energy production and exchange that underlies metabolic health. And more than 300 mutations in this DNA cause mitochondrial diseases — incurable genetic disorders with a wide range of symptoms that can rob people of their sight and hearing, trigger muscle problems and spark seizures&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. These disorders affect roughly 1 in 5,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because CRISPR can’t help with these problems, researchers have been looking for other ways to precisely edit the mitochrondrial genome. And the past few years have brought some success: the tools are already proving to be a boon for creating accurate animal models of mitochondrial diseases. “The progress has been remarkable,” says Jin-Soo Kim, a chemical biologist who develops mtDNA editing tools at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology in Daejeon, South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If researchers can make mtDNA editing safe and accurate enough, it could eventually be used to treat, and even cure, these genetic conditions. “It would be a medical breakthrough,” says Kim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A bacterial origin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact origins of mitochondria are murky, but the leading theory holds that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03224-5" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03224-5" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;the organelle’s story started&lt;/a&gt; around 1.5 billion years ago when a single-celled microorganism called an archaeon gobbled up a roaming bacterium that survived inside its host. This event marked the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01316-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01316-0" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;beginning of the eukaryotes&lt;/a&gt; — the large group of organisms, including plants, animals and fungi, in which cells contain organelles that are enclosed inside membranes. The swallowed bacterium retained its characteristic circular DNA as it settled into its new home, but over time it sacrificed most of its genes to the nuclear genome of its host.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the evolutionary lineage that gave rise to humans and other animals, this genetic transfer whittled the resident bacterium’s genome down to just 37 genes that code for 13 proteins involved in energy production, turning it into a specialized organelle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03064-x" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03307-x/d41586-025-03307-x_51487186.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Mitochondria expel tainted DNA — spurring age-related inflammation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The small amount of mitochondrial DNA that stuck around in animals differs in key ways from nuclear DNA, which in humans encodes around 20,000 genes. For a start, mtDNA is typically inherited solely from the mother. There can be several copies of mtDNA in each mitochondrion, and the organelle has its own built-in machinery for making RNA and proteins from that DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitochondrial DNA is also much more error-prone, with a mutation rate estimated to be 10–20 times greater than that of nuclear DNA. This is in part because it has to contend with a barrage of damaging reactive oxygen species — unstable molecules that are generated in mitochondria during normal energy production. But it’s also because it &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00334-4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00334-4" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;doesn’t have histones&lt;/a&gt;: the proteins that protect and package nuclear DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with its counterpart in the nucleus, mtDNA’s toolkit for repairing itself is rudimentary. The nucleus is quick to fix a snapped DNA strand using an arsenal of repair mechanisms, but mitochondria can mend only some defects. They often simply throw away their broken DNA. This difference limits the options for gene-editing tools, because nearly all such tools for nuclear DNA use its inherent repair pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been notoriously challenging to develop approaches for modifying mitochondrial DNA, says Stephen Ekker, a molecular biologist at the University of Texas at Austin. “Its bacterial origins are revealed when you start trying to edit it,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most crucial hurdle for scientists trying to tinker with the mitochondrial genome is that it is locked behind a wall of membranes that doesn’t allow external nucleic acids to pass into the organelle. Although there have been hints that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03837-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03837-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;CRISPR-based gene-editing tools&lt;/a&gt; — which rely on RNA to guide them to the correct sequence — might be able to overcome these barriers, many researchers remain unconvinced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Snip and trash&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there are other ways in. More than a decade before CRISPR became a research tool, mitochondria researchers began experimenting with other editing tools that could cross mitochondrial membranes and coax the organelles into &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03064-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03064-x" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;ditching their problematic DNA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every cell contains a vast number of mitochondrial genomes, because cells contain thousands of mitochondria and each one can carry several copies of mtDNA. Healthy and mutated mtDNA often coexist: a state known as heteroplasmy. It’s when the proportion of mutated mtDNA reaches 60–80% in a particular tissue or cell type that mitochondrial diseases manifest&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01064-5" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03307-x/d41586-025-03307-x_51117492.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Cells are swapping their mitochondria. What does this mean for our health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If researchers could reduce the faulty copies of mtDNA in cells, they could eliminate the resulting disease. So, they turned to enzymes called zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) to snip the double-stranded mtDNA. Whereas targeted snipping of nuclear DNA cajoles the cut DNA strands to glue themselves back together without the harmful mutation, the cut DNA in mitochondria is simply cast out. This elimination triggers the remaining intact copies to replicate themselves so that the correct level of mtDNA is maintained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most cases, the mutated copies will be reduced to an acceptable level as the normal copies are replicated. “That’s going to make up for what you’re destroying,” says Carlos Moraes, a geneticist at the University of Miami in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there has been progress with this approach, it hasn’t made its way out of the laboratory. And even if it did reach the clinic, the technique would be powerless against diseases caused by mutations that are often present in all copies of a person’s mtDNA, such as Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), a rare condition that causes rapid vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What researchers need are tools that do more than cut DNA but that don’t rely on guide RNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;CRISPR-free base editing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When CRISPR–Cas9 emerged as a tool in 2012, it became the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/531155a" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/531155a" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;go-to gene editor&lt;/a&gt; for all kinds of application. A guide RNA directs the Cas9 enzyme to a specific DNA sequence, where the enzyme does the cutting. Genetic changes are introduced as the DNA repairs itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach became even more useful in 2016, when David Liu, a chemical biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and his colleagues introduced a more precise technique called &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03543-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03543-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;base editing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In this case, researchers modify the Cas9 enzyme and rely on another enzyme, called a deaminase, to convert one DNA base letter to another — such as cytosine (C) to thymine (T) or adenine (A) to guanine (G).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01716-y" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03307-x/d41586-025-03307-x_27197990.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Hope, despair and CRISPR — the race to save one woman’s life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although base editing and other CRISPR techniques took off for nuclear DNA, Liu and other research teams couldn’t get it working on mtDNA. Because CRISPR’s guide RNA doesn’t readily pass through a mitochondrion’s double membrane, using precise tools on mtDNA remained a pipe dream. “We did not have much success,” says Liu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A solution materialized in 2018 when Joseph Mougous, a microbiologist then at the University of Washington in Seattle, and his colleagues stumbled across a toxin made by the bacterium &lt;i&gt;Burkholderia cenocepacia&lt;/i&gt;. This enzyme, a deadly weapon against other bacteria, wreaks havoc by ultimately converting base C to T across the bacterial genome&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mougous, now based at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, e-mailed Liu asking whether the enzyme, called DddA, would be of any use to him. “I knew exactly what it might be used for — base editing mtDNA!” says Liu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But switching every C to a T would be lethal to cells. Liu and his colleagues set out to “tame the beast”. They split DddA into two inactive pieces so that the enzyme would do its handiwork on mtDNA only when the pieces were brought together in a particular orientation. And instead of using guide RNA, Liu and his colleagues modified proteins found in TALENs to direct the DddA segments to their target sequences (see ‘Making the edit’).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03307-x/d41586-025-03307-x_51566922.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03307-x/d41586-025-03307-x_51566922.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Making the edit: a diagram showing a method of editing base pairs in mitochondrial DNA, using an enzyme DddA attached to a protein TALE, that binds to specified DNA sequences." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03307-x/d41586-025-03307-x_51566922.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your mood fluctuations feel less like your usual stress and anxiety and more like the beginnings of a villain origin story (and you’re also experiencing symptoms like insomnia and feeling warmer than usual), it could be the beginning stages of perimenopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what doctors call the transition to menopause, which is the end of a person’s reproductive years and technically marked by 12 consecutive months without a period, with the full transition taking anywhere from two to eight years, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/menopause/menopause-basics" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7956240" data-affiliate="true"&gt;according to the Office on Women’s Health&lt;/a&gt; (OWH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perimenopause usually begins after the age of 40 (though it can start earlier), the variabilities of which — both in ovarian function and hormone levels — can leave you feeling out of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s generally a confusing time that catches many of us by surprise, in large part because of how wildly unpredictable symptoms of perimenopause can be,” Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.annabarbieri-md.com" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7956240" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Anna Barbieri&lt;/a&gt;, New York-based OB-GYN and founding physician at &lt;a href="https://www.elektrahealth.com" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7956240" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Elektra Health&lt;/a&gt;, told HuffPost. “Hormonal changes, and the way symptoms show up, are anything but linear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some, periods can still be regular in the early stages of perimenopause, making it easy to brush off mood-related symptoms (anxiety, irritability, crying spells) as being caused by things like stress, sleep deprivation or burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But start adding signs of cognitive decline to the mix — drawing a blank as to what someone just told you, forgetting what you walked into a room to do — and these ongoing mental blips can trigger understandable waves of panic and fear as to what exactly is going on with that mind of yours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The possible links between perimenopause and mental health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our 20s and 30s (pre-menopause), there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.menopause.org/for-women/menopauseflashes/menopause-symptoms-and-treatments/going-mad-in-perimenopause-signs-and-solutions" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7956240" data-affiliate="true"&gt;predictable ebb and flow&lt;/a&gt; to our hormones — ditto post-menopause, a time when our hormones are low, but steady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perimenopausal period is marked by one long hormonal fluctuation, with levels of estrogen and progesterone (typically referred to as “female” hormones) varying quite a bit. Testosterone — a “male” hormone that’s produced at lower levels in people assigned female at birth — takes a slow dip as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: “Your hormones are a rollercoaster, and the rest of you is along for the ride,” Barbieri said.&lt;/p&gt;

Yeah, this one’s got that in spades. In a video posted by @pearl.the.golden.girl, big sis Pearl is lying on her side when her puppy sister Poppi toddles over and curls up right into her belly, like she was meant to fit there all along. The whole scene feels like a warm hug — calm, safe, and full of love and understanding. &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; Pearl seems to have a mountain of patience for her little sister, and Poppi’s every move screams that she trusts her older sister with her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Golden Retriever puppy cuddling big sister will melt anyone’s heart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The video has won several hearts online. The in-video text sets the tone: “Getting our dog a puppy so she never had to be lonely.” From there, it’s just pure comfort and sweetness. Little Poppi comes, sits, and lies down right in the crook of Pearl’s belly. She finds the coziest spot between Pearl’s front and hind legs before resting her head on her sister’s back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Pearl gets up at this, but then lies straight back down. She ensures that Poppi has enough space to stretch. In the next shot, Poppi rests her head against Pearl’s front leg. The puppy gets up for just a second and then puts her head down again, becoming as comfortable as possible. She sighs like she’s finally found home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The video ends with them curled up together, fast asleep and perfectly nestled against each other, like puzzle pieces that fit. The caption reads, “Can you even? This moment melted me. They feel so safe with each other and every time they cuddle. I can’t help but be so thankful for their bond already.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Viewers clearly felt the same way. One comment called them “the best corner of the internet,” while another wrote, “If people were more like dogs, what a wonderful place this would be.” The post has over 106K likes, and honestly, it’s easy to see why — Pearl and Poppi make love look effortless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/194162-video-golden-retriever-puppy-cuddling-big-sister" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Video: Golden Retriever Puppy Coming to Cuddle Big Sister Is Cutest Thing on Internet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Video: Golden Retriever Puppy Coming to Cuddle Big Sister Is Cutest Thing on Internet&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 10:24:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxQdWZnYU1SNWY3d1BoRUhuMDRkaTRlSE8tXzJBQzBSRzliYk8tUDlfaVp5U1NFaWl5LTRWdHUzZFJEellpaFFqUllrR1pQTUxOcEdra1JPTkJoMmczcnZYY2FWU0tZYVBhRmxSRVN0c2gtekFBLTdjcllJQ2YxX1k4YTNWTksxSWxxa3BLQ3ZTdHJPd2hLdHc</guid></item><item><title>没有人认真对待的头痛如何让这位29岁的新妈妈付出了生命的代价（独家） - AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/headache-no-one-took-seriously-083000616.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shannel Pearman&lt;/p&gt; Shannel Pearman and her husband Jared&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NEED TO KNOW&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shannel Pearman had built the life she always dreamed of: a thriving career as a TV reporter, a loving husband in Jared — a photographer she met while working at a station — and a home in Baltimore&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple had been eagerly awaiting the arrival of their first child, a son due in May 2019, For most of her pregnancy, everything went exactly as she hoped. But as her due date neared, troubling symptoms crept in: sudden swelling, rapid weight gain and elevated blood pressure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day had started off perfectly. Family filled the Pearman home in Baltimore, Md., eager to meet &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shannelpearman" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Shannel Pearmen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Shannel Pearmen&lt;/a&gt; and her husband Jared’s newborn son — the first grandchild on both sides. There was food, laughter and the kind of joy that comes from gathering around a baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even as the house buzzed with happiness, Shannel was battling a nagging headache. She brushed it off as the exhaustion of new motherhood, assuming that by bedtime a little medicine would make it fade. Instead, the pain only grew worse. Her son’s cries kept her awake through the night — something that, looking back now, she says may have saved her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By morning, the headache had escalated. Without warning, Shannel was overcome by the urge to vomit. As she rushed to the bathroom, Jared followed close behind. When she looked up at him, half of his face had vanished from her vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that instant, she knew something was terribly wrong. Shannel called her mother, a nurse, who urged her to get to the hospital immediately. The couple grabbed their one-week-old baby, threw a few things into a bag and sped through the night to the emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was supposed to be one of the happiest times of my life,” Shannel, then 29, tells PEOPLE exclusively. “We had just had our first child. We were over the moon. But overnight, everything changed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shannel Pearman&lt;/p&gt; Shannel Pearman and her husband Jared&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just weeks earlier, life had felt picture-perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was June 2019, and Shannel had built the life she always dreamed of: a thriving career as a TV reporter, a loving husband in Jared — a photographer she met while working at a station — and a home in Baltimore. The couple had been eagerly awaiting the arrival of their first child, a son due in May 2019, and for most of her pregnancy, everything went exactly as she hoped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was my first child. I was glowing and happy, just wanting to rub my belly and enjoy it,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as her due date neared, troubling symptoms crept in: sudden swelling, rapid weight gain and elevated blood pressure. Shannel voiced her concerns repeatedly, but says they were brushed aside. “Everyone kept telling me it was normal — that the swelling would go down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, her condition worsened. At 41 weeks, she was induced and labored for hours before doctors determined an emergency C-section was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because of the surgery, I couldn’t hold my son right away,” she recalls. “That was so emotional. I had just given birth, my son was here, but I couldn’t hold him yet. I just couldn’t wait to finally have him in my arms. When the moment finally came in the early hours of the morning, even though I was exhausted, it was one of the best feelings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shannel Pearman&lt;/p&gt; Shannel Pearman and her husband Jared with their newborn son&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the troubling symptoms didn’t disappear. Shannel left the hospital with reassurances that everything was fine — that the swelling was normal and would resolve with time. She was told to come back in six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But just one week later, on June 1, 2019, a splitting headache and blurred vision sent her racing back to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What followed was a blur. Doctors shuffled her between units — labor and delivery, then other departments — but never ordered a CT scan. Hours slipped by. It wasn’t until her mother arrived from Delaware and demanded answers that a scan was finally performed. That’s when they discovered the truth: Shannel was in the middle of a &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23969-hemorrhagic-stroke" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hemorrhagic stroke;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hemorrhagic stroke&lt;/a&gt;, caused by a ruptured blood vessel in her brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was disbelief,” she says. “I was 29 years old. I was healthy. I had no health issues. I had just been in the hospital. Everything seemed fine. We didn’t think anything seriously wrong was happening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shannel Pearman&lt;/p&gt; Shannel Pearman in the hospital&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long after, Shannel lost consciousness. The last thing she remembers is sitting in the ER holding her newborn as medical teams tried to comfort her. From there, she was rushed into emergency brain surgery, during which doctors removed half of her skull to relieve the swelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her next clear memory is waking up in a different hospital. She remembers fumbling with her phone, trying to send texts until someone enlarged the font so she could read the words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The first few days felt like an out-of-body experience,” she says. “I had lost my left peripheral vision in both eyes. Waking up and not being able to see was emotional. But more than anything, I was just thankful to be alive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shannel Pearman&lt;/p&gt; Shannel Pearman in the hospital after her stroke&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before her stroke, Shannel, now 35, had planned to breastfeed her son. It had taken a few days to find a rhythm with him — and just as she did, everything changed. But her family refused to let that dream slip away. While she was in the ICU, Jared taught himself how to use a breast pump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No one there knew how — I was the youngest patient on the floor — so my husband had to figure it out himself,” she says. Relatives pitched in, creating a relay system: pumping, cleaning parts and driving milk from the hospital to their baby so she could continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Something my family always noted is that no matter what I was going through, whenever I spoke, I was full of positivity,” she adds. “I was excited about what life could look like after I got through all of this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her optimism carried her, but recovery was grueling. Shannel spent less than a week in the hospital before she was discharged, but until her second surgery on July 25, she had to wear a protective helmet anytime she wasn’t sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hated that thing,” she admits. “It was so bulky and uncomfortable, and I had to wear it constantly. I’m thankful for its purpose — it protected my head — but I couldn’t wait to be rid of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When her helmet finally came off, it felt like freedom — yet the relief was paired with a sobering truth: nothing was going back to the way it was. She would not return to work, she could no longer drive and her vision would never fully come back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the help of occupational therapists and specialists, Shannel began to relearn how to navigate life. Still, at first, she didn’t fully understand what living with a brain injury would mean. Weeks — even months — passed before the reality truly set in. She had regained the ability to walk and talk, but invisible struggles remained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I struggle with processing, with crippling migraines, with reading and speaking sometimes,” Shannel explains. “There are moments when I can’t find the word I want or can’t get it out. And because the disabilities are invisible, it makes it even more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Essentially everything I do now is impacted by my brain injury,” she adds. “Something as simple as writing on paper takes extra effort. Everything has changed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shannel Pearman&lt;/p&gt; Shannel Pearman wearing her helmet and holding her son&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back, Shannel says that rather than hide what she was going through, she made a different choice: to share it. Just days after leaving the hospital, she posted updates on Instagram — helmet on, baby in hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what began as personal updates for friends and family soon grew into something larger, as strangers connected with her honesty. Today, she uses that platform to raise awareness about maternal health, Black maternal health and stroke among young people — issues she admits she barely knew about before her ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her posts have since reached millions, including one video of her struggling to recall the color yellow. That clip alone has been &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shannelpearman/video/7536997510041193758" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:viewed more than 6.6 million times;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;viewed more than 6.6 million times&lt;/a&gt; and drawn over 16,000 comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When that one picked up traction, I was so surprised because honestly, I didn’t even want to post it,” she admits. “I share so much of my journey, but that moment felt too raw, too vulnerable. I thought it was embarrassing. But my husband captured it, and I thought, maybe I should share — because it’s one thing to hear me talk about the struggle, it’s another to actually see it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, she posted the clip and logged off, too nervous to check. When she finally returned, the response floored her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was taken aback that this video — the one I almost didn’t post — was getting millions of views,” she says with a laugh. “But then I started reading the comments, and it made me emotional."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On one hand, there was so much love and encouragement from strangers cheering me on," she adds. "And on the other hand, there were people who could relate. That broke my heart, but it also made me grateful. Because for them, seeing that video meant they weren’t alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, one of the hardest things she’s shared publicly has been her decision about whether to have another child. She and Jared had always dreamed of a bigger family, but after the stroke, the idea felt terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Part of me felt like the stroke had robbed me of so much,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took a year and a half of therapy, medical consultations and prayer before they were ready to even consider it. Ultimately, they made a plan — and when Shannel became pregnant again, joy came with new fears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her second pregnancy wasn’t easy. PTSD triggered anxiety and depression, but she carried on and eventually welcomed a daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our family is complete,” she says with a laugh. “We have our baby boy, our baby girl. Confidently, we are never having another child again — I cannot go through this again. Our family is complete, and it is perfect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shannel Pearman&lt;/p&gt; Shannel Pearman and her husband Jared and kids&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days, she says her focus is simple: “surviving the day.” Her symptoms remain unpredictable; stress, overstimulation or bright light can trigger severe migraines. She relies on Nurtec for relief, plus supplements and calming routines — coffee, hydration, slow mornings — to reduce risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, life with two little ones and a brain injury is anything but quiet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Where my brain needs peace and quiet, my kids give me everything but that,” she laughs. “I’m just trying to show up and be the best mom I can be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She’s even started talking to her son about her disability. “He’s six now, and that has been heartbreaking. The first conversation I had with him was explaining that I’m visually impaired, or ‘partially blind,’ as I say to him, and that’s why Mommy doesn’t drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had a suspicion he already knew, because sometimes he’d test me — like standing on my left side to see if I could see him," she adds. "When I finally sat him down, he could repeat back what I said, but I don’t think he fully understands. For my sixth stroke anniversary, we watched some of my videos together, and he recognizes when I’m in a hospital gown — he’ll say, ‘That’s a stroke video, Mommy had a stroke.’ But I don’t think he quite grasps what that means.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on her journey, Shannel’s voice softens and tears fill her eyes. “I hate that it has happened, and I hate that I’m disabled,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years after her stroke, the weight of her new reality hit hard. She wasn’t going back to work as a reporter. She couldn’t drive. Depression took hold, and dark days stretched on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But last year marked a turning point. She realized she could sit in bed all day and cry, but life wouldn’t wait. Her children were growing, and she had been given a second chance — a new opportunity she couldn’t waste. “I can’t just rot away — I don’t deserve that, my kids don’t deserve that, my husband doesn’t deserve that,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk: PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So she made a conscious choice to embrace the life she still had. “Yes, this sucks, but I’m going to live. I’ll take my kids to the Maryland State Fair, and maybe I’ll have a migraine afterward — but it’s okay. We’ll roll with the punches. Since making that shift, I’ve been able to truly be happy in this space. My old self would be proud of that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her outlook has transformed. The struggles remain, but she’s focused on what truly matters: family, life, and creating memories. "Nothing else matters,” she says, a quiet certainty in her voice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/headache-nearly-cost-new-mom-29-her-life-exclusive-11812304" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 10:07:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE52TzhDcmFNcXF5aG1rbTVTZmVUUzVfS0Z6cU9NaDdDenlCVHFNZUZzYWJzaWFST2F3MUF0UHY4S0lyUmpYRUJQWGVXZnk4T2h2VWxIbWxyY0JCR3FUVU16YW1pV3ZXVncybE5OY2x0b01yXzVJQjVBU2JJd3ZrbzQ</guid></item><item><title>一氧化碳中毒的首个解毒剂，在几分钟内“净化”血液-好消息网络</title><link>https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/first-antidote-for-carbon-monoxide-poisoning-cleans-blood-in-minutes/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

BY-SA&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s invisible, it’s lethal, and it’s been with us for decades, but carbon monoxide poisoning can now be fought with the first-ever antidote that rapidly removes the toxic molecule from the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon monoxide or CO, poisoning accounts for 50,000 emergency room visits in the US each year and causes about 1,500 deaths, each one being lamented as a shameful waste and tragic oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the only treatments for CO poisoning are oxygen-based therapies, which help the body eliminate the toxic gas. However, even with treatment, nearly half of survivors suffer long-term heart and brain damage. This has created an urgent need for faster, more effective interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a study &lt;a href="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/news/2025/new-protein-therapy-shows-promise-as-first-ever-antidote-for-carbon-monoxide-poisoning.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; by University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) in &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2501389122" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;PNAS&lt;/a&gt;, the research team developed a new engineered protein-based therapy called RcoM-HBD-CCC, which acts like a sponge to soak up carbon monoxide from the blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RcoM (short for “regulator of metabolism”) is a natural protein isolated from the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Paraburkholderia xenovorans &lt;/em&gt;which uses it to sense minute levels of carbon monoxide in its environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers engineered a version that is highly selective, grabbing CO without interfering with oxygen or other important molecules in the bloodstream like nitric oxide, which is vital for the regulation of blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In tests on mice, the new therapy worked quickly to remove CO from red blood cells and was safely flushed out of the body through urine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CO is known commonly as the “silent killer,” because this odorless, invisible gas, typically released from combustion sources, including stovetops, propane heaters, car exhausts, and firewood, poisons in a gradual manner that isn’t immediately obvious to the victim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE FIRST AID ADVANCES: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Revolutionary Antidote Neutralizes Venom of 19 of World’s Deadliest Snakes–Thanks to Man Who Immunized Himself" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/revolutionary-new-antidote-neutralizes-venom-of-19-of-the-worlds-deadliest-snakes/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Revolutionary Antidote Neutralizes Venom of 19 of World’s Deadliest Snakes–Thanks to Man Who Immunized Himself&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In healthy bodies, oxygen inhaled from the air binds to the protein hemoglobin on the surface of red blood cells, which then ferry the oxygen to all the tissues of the body. CO however, competes with oxygen for hemoglobin. It enters the bloodstream and binds to hemoglobin with a 200 to 400-fold greater affinity than oxygen. That means CO hogs most of the hemoglobin seats, so not enough oxygen molecules can get a ride to the tissues that need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the only available treatments for carbon monoxide poisoning involve giving 100% pure oxygen, sometimes under pressure in a hyperbaric chamber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All too often, patients are not transported, diagnosed, and treated in time to reverse the effects of CO poisoning, which can cause lasting cardiac and neurological injuries or even death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE HOUSEHOLD TOXINS DEFEATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Flint Finishes Replacing 11,000 Lead Pipes, Concluding Activists’ Decade-Long Effort to Secure Clean Water" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/flint-finishes-replacing-11000-lead-pipes-concluding-activists-decade-long-effort-to-secure-clean-water/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Flint Finishes Replacing 11,000 Lead Pipes, Concluding Activists’ Decade-Long Effort to Secure Clean Water&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infused in the bloodstream, scavenger hemoproteins like RcoM-HBD-CCC rapidly bind to carbon monoxide molecules, reducing the time it takes to clear half of the carbon monoxide in the blood to less than a minute, compared to more than hour with pure oxygen therapy and five hours without any treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A potential drawback the researchers were aware of is that so-called “scavengers” like RcoM also have an affinity for oxygen, and so may uptake the nitric oxide mentioned earlier. This can cause wild and potentially unsafe changes in blood pressure, but RcoM-HBD-CCC caused no such side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unlike other protein-based treatments, we found the compound caused only minimal changes in blood pressure, which was an exciting finding and raised the potential for this new molecule to have clinical applications,” said study corresponding author Mark T. Gladwin, MD, Dean of UMSOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This has the potential to become a rapid, intravenous antidote for carbon monoxide that could be given in the emergency department or even in the field by first-responders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future studies will likely include more pre-clinical research to determine the safe and effective dosage range for RcoM-HBD-CCC in treating carbon monoxide poisoning. It could also form the basis for new research in other fields, including as an oxygen delivery therapy or blood substitute. This could include hemorrhagic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe anemias, and the preservation of organs for transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;
