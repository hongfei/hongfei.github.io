			&lt;p&gt;Many of the body's processes slow down or falter as we get older, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/body-resurrects-cells-marked-for-death-solving-a-50-year-mystery"&gt;tissue regeneration&lt;/a&gt;. In a new study, researchers detail a promising method to get this vital repair work back up to speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, from a team at the University of California, San Francisco, identified four &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"&gt;transcription factors&lt;/a&gt; – proteins that control the activity of other genes – that have a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-a-way-to-recharge-aging-human-cells"&gt;rejuvenating effect&lt;/a&gt; on cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers boosted production of one of these transcription factors in the liver cells of elderly mice, they noticed numerous benefits: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-daily-habits-could-be-causing-your-liver-serious-harm"&gt;fat and scarring&lt;/a&gt; were significantly reduced, and glucose tolerance improved – all signs of a more youthful organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/blood-of-exceptionally-long-lived-people-reveals-crucial-differences"&gt;Blood of Exceptionally Long-Lived People Reveals Crucial Differences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also tinkered with the levels of all four transcription factors in lab-grown human &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"&gt;fibroblast cells&lt;/a&gt;. Fibroblasts make up connective tissue and provide scaffolding around other cells and organs. Again, multiple signs of youthfulness were spotted as a result, including increased cell division and boosted energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By altering gene expression using the transcription factors we identified, old fibroblasts behaved as if they were younger, and improved the health of old mice," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1112231"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biochemist Hao Li.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188901" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188901" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/LiverScarring.jpg" alt="Liver scarring diagram" class="wp-image-188901 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/LiverScarring.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/LiverScarring-600x419.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-188901" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Increasing the expression of EZH2 (bottom row), one of four transcription factors identified, reduced liver scarring (blue stain) in older mice compared to controls (top row). (Sengstack et al., &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, 2026)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify the four key transcription factors, the researchers first compared old and young human fibroblast cells using a computational model to see how &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hundreds-of-genes-act-differently-in-male-vs-female-brains-scientists-discover"&gt;gene expression&lt;/a&gt; differed with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having drawn up a shortlist of 200 transcription factors that could be controlling the 'youthfulness' of cells, they began systematically toggling them on and off – changing the transcription factors produced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this tinkering led the researchers to the final four transcription factors that they tested in more detail: E2F3, EZH2, STAT3, and ZFX. Altering the levels of these factors in liver cells of mice and human fibroblast cells grown in plastic dishes shifted the cells &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-restore-aging-blood-stem-cells-to-a-more-youthful-state-in-mice"&gt;towards a younger mode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" class="alignnone wp-image-189354 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that these proteins had an effect across two different species and cell types suggests we could be looking at a universal blueprint of sorts, one that could be broadly applied to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/young-immune-cells-partly-reverse-alzheimers-symptoms-in-mice"&gt;reactivate youthful states&lt;/a&gt; in older cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These results suggest a shared set of molecular requirements for cellular and tissue rejuvenation across species," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2515183123"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's still early days for this research, and we're not yet talking about &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/gains-in-human-life-expectancy-may-have-already-passed-their-peak"&gt;extending lifespans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/axolotl-discovery-brings-us-closer-than-ever-to-regrowing-human-limbs"&gt;replacing limbs&lt;/a&gt; or rejuvenating the whole body. We only have the results from a few cell types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term safety needs to be considered, too. The experiments in mice lasted only a few weeks, so we still don't know what effects rejuvenating cells in this manner might have over extended periods. Too much cell growth connected to EZH2 has been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1933744100"&gt;linked with cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, with a global population that's growing older and living longer, potential ways of keeping our bodies &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-turning-point-when-your-bodys-aging-accelerates"&gt;healthier for longer&lt;/a&gt; should warrant further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our work opens up exciting new opportunities to understand and ultimately reverse aging-related diseases," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1112231"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biochemist Janine Sengstack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2515183123"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The paper, based on a review of 25 cluster cases, found that the patients had all suffered from known and diagnosable illnesses including cancer and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The lead author of the JAMA paper, Dr Anthony Lang, told the BBC on Friday that the provincial report "confirms our suspicion or belief that there was no environmental factor that could have accounted for such a broad range of neurological problems". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"There was no consistent neurological disease that we had seen in this small group of patients we described," Lang added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"So this just confirms exactly what we've suspected and really emphasises the suffering and pain that patients and families have had."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Nesbitt and other patients have rejected accusations that Marrero has misdiagnosed patients, and said he rightfully raised concerns about their test results of elevated metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She added some patients have expressed they do not want to see another neurologist "because they don't trust anybody anymore".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"He's a kind man, he's intelligent, he does due diligence," Nesbitt said, adding that he has done a considerable amount of testing on patients to help give them answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Marrero did not immediately reply to a request for comment about Friday's report. In September, he told the BBC that other senior federal and provincial scientists had also believed there was a novel syndrome in New Brunswick and that he was now being portrayed as the sole purveyor of the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"They are trying to present me as it," he said. "I was part of it, but I was not it. The only difference is, when the table was empty, I stayed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 20:01:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1VMzBWT2dPdmFsTTlfbUhfc3ZncVlEMlV3NGRhS3J3SU10TGkxRERiLXp1RVFzN1NPRzVBUnlKQmVkRmdZQ2JMdmM0ZWc2bHIxMjdBWmI5a3RPd9IBX0FVX3lxTFBwTFVWUjFHV0tkUG43M3NyRVFjc0d6N3c0aWU4ZF9xVU5BSWMtUjhib1ZYUC1hOEEtOW96Rk83cEZIQkRpN1NoNEY4YWpFYTE1bnBaUnFPU0JIZlEtdTlz</guid></item><item><title>旧金山报告本季首例流感死亡病例，加利福尼亚州各地病例呈上升趋势--《旧金山纪</title><link>https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/san-francisco-flu-deaths-21311591.php</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

So far I have everything from 2025 to 2018 updated. The great news is every recipe on my site is linked to WW recipe builder (only works from your phone) so it will automatically give you the new points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why High Protein?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As many of you know, I’ve been following a &lt;a href="https://www.skinnytaste.com/high-protein/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow"&gt;high-protein&lt;/a&gt; diet for the past few years for muscle gain, and it’s been a total game changer for me! I feel stronger and more satisfied, which keeps me from reaching for sweets or chips between meals or at the end of the day. I know a lot of you struggle with hitting your protein goals, so I was inspired to create this &lt;a href="https://www.skinnytaste.com/high-protein/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow"&gt;high-protein&lt;/a&gt; meal plan for the week. If you enjoy it, I’ll share 1 or 2 each month. Plus, I’m working on a high-protein cookbook, so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To reach my protein goals, I typically divide it across three meals. For example, if my goal is 120 grams of protein per day, I aim for at least 30 grams per meal, plus 10 to 30 grams with each snack. If you’re not sure how much protein you should eat in a day, this &lt;a href="https://examine.com/guides/protein-intake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; may be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How It Works&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re new to my &lt;a href="https://www.skinnytaste.com/meal-plans/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow"&gt;meal plans&lt;/a&gt;, these are meant as a guide, with &lt;strong&gt;plenty of wiggle room&lt;/strong&gt; for you to &lt;strong&gt;add more food&lt;/strong&gt;, coffee, beverages, fruits, &lt;a href="https://www.skinnytaste.com/recipes/snacks/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow"&gt;snacks&lt;/a&gt;, dessert, etc. or swap recipes out for meals you prefer, you can search for &lt;a href="https://www.skinnytaste.com/recipes/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow"&gt;recipes&lt;/a&gt; by course in the &lt;a href="https://www.skinnytaste.com/recipes/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow"&gt;index&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on your goals, you should aim for at least 1500 calories* per day. There’s no one size fits all, this will range by your goals, your age, weight, etc. Always talk to your nutritionist or dietician for your specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Note&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those with kidney or liver disease, gout, specific metabolic disorders, or older adults with reduced kidney function may need to limit protein to avoid complications. It’s always best to consult a healthcare provider or dietitian before significantly increasing protein intake, especially if you have any underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

"It's very clear based on where these outbreaks are occurring."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The CDC currently &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; that people receive two doses of the MMR vaccine, the first at ages 12 to 15 months and the second between 4 and 6 years old. One dose is 93% effective, and two doses are 97% effective against measles, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;However, federal data shows vaccination rates have been lagging in recent years.

    &lt;p&gt;This is all relatively straightforward, but it turns out the significance of Dr Epley and his manoeuvre is considerably greater (importantly so) than previously appreciated. Dr Hilary Cox of Newcastle University reports that those calcium crystals may also account for a much wider range of balance problems and predisposition to falls (with all their attendant hazards) in the older age group, even in the absence of those classic symptoms of acute positional change induced vertigo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is necessarily more difficult to ascertain and remedy, nonetheless “barriers to diagnosis and treatment can be overcome with simple practical measures”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;An unusual remedy for hiccups which does not require a trip to A&amp;amp;E&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/12/31/millions-go-to-ae-for-hiccups-and-sore-throats/"&gt;As recently reported&lt;/a&gt; in this paper, many more people nowadays are heading to A&amp;amp;E for their ‘minor’ symptoms: for coughs a tenfold increase over the past five years to 435,000, almost 300,000 for constipation, 69,000 for a blocked nose, 20,000 for nausea and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still the surprising revelation of 4,200 attendances for hiccups would certainly suggest the need for a greater appreciation of the diverse range of simple remedies. The most familiar – holding one’s breath and counting to 40 – is presumed to splint the diaphragm (stop it moving), countering the spontaneous muscular contractions responsible for the hiccup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that does not work, several methods of sipping water can be tried. “My mother used to make me stand, bend over a glass of water and take regular sips from the wrong (far) side of the glass”, one reader recalls. Another advises, “Grip the nose, press the ear flaps inwards and drink from a cup of water.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The erstwhile world authority on hiccups, Dr Janet Travell, advised the rather different approach of stimulating the uvula, the fleshy protuberance at the back of the throat. This can be accomplished by, for example, pulling forcefully on the tongue or stroking with a cotton bud. Swallowing dry granulated sugar or sucking on a lemon wedge soaked in Angostura Bitters may be effective for similar impact on the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, there is the option of activating the autonomic nervous system that controls the rhythmic contractions of the muscles of the diaphragm. This is most readily accomplished by pressing on the eyeballs or massaging the carotid artery on the side of the neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1988, emergency physician Dr Francis Fesmire reported the impressive benefits of a more intrusive method in a 27-year-old man afflicted with hiccupping up to 30 times a minute for 72 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When pulling on the tongue and eyeball compression proved unsuccessful, slow circumferential rectal massage was attempted. The frequency of the hiccups slowed immediately and ceased soon after.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Email queries and comments in confidence to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ck-anchor ck-custom-link" href="mailto:Drjames@telegraph.co.uk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drjames@telegraph.co.uk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The Commonwealth has ZIP codes that range from very low risk for a measles outbreak, such as Winthrop’s 02152, to very high risk, such as Middlefield’s 01243 and Conway’s 01341, based on the percentage of children younger than 5 who have had at least one shot of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Compared to other New England states such as New Hampshire and Vermont, Massachusetts has comparatively fewer high-risk ZIP codes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Outbreaks are much more likely to happen where there is low vaccination,” said Dr. Ben Rader, scientific director of Boston Children’s Hospital’s innovation group, who coauthored the paper with Brownstein. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In their study, the researchers sought to capture children who are often missing from official reporting systems, such as those who are homeschooled, uninsured, or too young to attend kindergarten. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;For that reason, their estimates for the number of kids vaccinated for measles are lower than those of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Brownstein and Rader started this work while researching vaccine hesitancy during the COVID-19 pandemic. They noticed that skepticism surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine seemed to spill over into routine childhood immunization, including the measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, shot.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;To gather their data, the researchers used an online surveillance platform called Outbreaks Near Me, where parents voluntarily reported whether their children under 5 had received at least one dose of the MMR vaccine. They then applied a&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;statistical method that uses limited survey data and population information to estimate what’s happening in a community, and a geospatial AI tool developed by Google to estimate vaccination rate down to the ZIP code level. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Places that we found had severe pockets of under-vaccination ultimately became sources of major outbreaks in the US, like in West Texas and New Mexico,” Brownstein said. “But even more concerning is that it will likely reflect where we’re going to see future outbreaks in the coming years.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dr. David Hamer, professor of global health and medicine at Boston University, said Massachusetts remains relatively protected except for a few areas. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;However, New England’s interconnectedness complicates risk. Travel between states increases the chance that measles from higher-risk areas could spread. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It just increases our vulnerability for those areas in our state in particular that might have low vaccination rates,” said Dr. Nahid Bhadelia, an infectious disease physician and founding director of Boston University Center on emerging infectious diseases. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Bhadelia noted that parts of Western Massachusetts are beginning to show lower vaccination coverage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The concern for a state like Massachusetts that still maintains a pretty high overall vaccination is when you get these coalescing pockets of lower immunity,” she said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Hamer said measles is one of the most contagious viruses known, requiring population-wide vaccination rates of roughly 93 to 95 percent to maintain herd immunity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Vaccination, of course, is about protecting yourself and your families, but it’s also about your community,” Brownstein said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Bhadelia said that losing measles elimination status would signal more than just a symbolic failure. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It really gives you a state of the nation in terms of our public health and our public health readiness and preparedness,” she said. “It’s reputational, but it also is saying something about disease burden within the country.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;A panel of international experts will review the US’s &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/19/well/year-anniversary-measles-outbreak-elimination-status.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/19/well/year-anniversary-measles-outbreak-elimination-status.html"&gt;measles elimination status&lt;/a&gt; later this year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;She said rapid case identification, contact tracing, and public education will be essential to prevent outbreaks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The best we can do is continue to make sure that children are getting their first dose of MMR, and that they’re getting their second dose at the appropriate age,” Hamer said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends children receive their first dose between the ages of 12 and 15 months and the second dose between ages 4 and 6. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Despite growing risks nationwide, Massachusetts’ strong public health infrastructure remains a critical safeguard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We’re great, but we’re not perfect,” Brownstein said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

Gut-wrenchingly said she was on a journey toward forgiving the driver who crashed into her family three years earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She became a campaigner for increased highway safety while raising her family, but in June 2025 Chris says he began to realize something was wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told People that he noticed Lori was 'getting more clumsy', and would accidentally run into walls, stub her toe, and drop drinking glasses on a more regular basis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within a month, he says he noticed stroke-like symptoms, as Lori's 'mouth started to droop a little bit... it became too much to ignore.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After taking her to hospital, Lori was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, devastating the family almost 20 years after the tragedy that took the lives of their three young children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was hoping we were done with the life-changing, life-altering disasters where life as you knew it yesterday is gone,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In 2007,  a big rig truck slammed into the back of Lori Coble's  minivan, killing her children Kyle Christopher, 5, Emma Lynn, 4, and Katie Gene, 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lori is pictured with her husband Chris and the triplets she gave birth to a year after the deaths of her other three children. Tragically, she has now died of brain cancer aged just 48 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lori died on Wednesday evening aged 48, just weeks after being put on hospice care with stage 4 glioblastoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;her family shared the news on social media, writing that she was 'deeply loved and supported throughout this journey' as she fought the disease for months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Lori was deeply loved and supported throughout this journey. She was surrounded by care, peace, and those who held her close as she passed,' her family wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Her strength, kindness, and quiet courage touched far more people than she ever realized.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family received an outpouring of support, as many paid tribute to Lori for having rebuilt her life in the wake of losing her children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this month, Chris told People as his wife entered hospice care that only welcoming their triplets - Jake Christopher, Ashley Lynn, Ellie Gene, each carrying an older sibling's middle name - got him through the heartbreak almost 20 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It took me over four years to come out of the fog and pain of what happened,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lori shared her story with Oprah in 2010, where she said being blessed with triplets felt like a miracle, and gut-wrenchingly said she was on a journey toward forgiving the driver who crashed into her family three years earlier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lori's husband Chris said her terminal brain cancer diagnosis was devastating after having previously lost their children.

But at the same time, I was trying to avoid falling apart in front of them, I’d go into the other room and cry real quick and come back and put a smile on my face.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Family friend Becky Leonard said Lori re-dedicated herself to raising her triplets, saying she found her resilience 'extraordinary.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Everybody who knows her, loves her,' she said. 'First and foremost, she's a mom.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chris said when Lori was diagnosed with brain cancer, doctors told her she had two choices - to fight it and possibly survive another year, or be made comfortable for the remainder of her time she had left. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She wanted to fight it,' Chris said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Chris said Lori's diagnosis came after he noticed she was 'getting more clumsy', and would accidentally run into walls, stub her toe, and drop drinking glasses on a more regular basis - before her 'mouth started to droop a little bit... it became too much to ignore'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tributes poured in for Lori following news of her passing as she became a symbol of hope and resilience for many across America &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added at the time, three weeks before Lori passed away: 'Everything we do is not to save her life, it’s to keep her alive as long as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I started mourning the loss of my wife the day she got diagnosed. I didn’t have a lot of hope at the outset – and that weighed heavily on me. I was really upset, mad, angry. How could this be happening to us again?' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He recalled that after her first brain surgery, Lori told him: 'This isn't going to take me down. I'm not done.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She wants to be a grandma. She wants to be there when her kids graduate. She wants her life that she’s built so beautifully,' he said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a second surgery was more complicated, and resulted in Lori losing motor control on her left side. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There were a lot of people in the hospital that were really pulling for her,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lori tragically went downhill following the surgery, and by mid-November she suffered a brain infection, which was followed by an infection in her lungs and pneumonia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I would give my life for hers in a heartbeat. But I can't do that. I'm helpless,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 14:27:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxPSFdtZkJYSUFCNE9jSEFyWDRBOHhfSHlxb2dMSmlUX2NoMjBqdTJMZS0wR1hSOGdpN3JZRDNaWTFsWURXOFFBb3lFZjRfVHYtN3M1aFRXcTUyRndHVzVBTHNSQXF4OUVRclFUcHlPOTFhNlluU2V3WEZ4VUtOaWRKSUFYTmpxcldDc2FDZ0JvWnAtckpxdDdwblpycjZIRWw1X3pkam130gGrAUFVX3lxTFBoQ1QyRXFHX3VDV1NyYnpxbi1RZzdzUHJnQ1dLUDRvODktTUZ1MVpNMjFSZ3k4aGtTNXNzVTh1UGxyZjE3QTYtSkdFMkNQb0JzdzBaM21rZ3JGWjFGanZhUHozUmk0NVZUU2dtcUs2QkpqeEdYMVZNbE1lQVlIVmY1T1kwRUx5dU00UkJlUElxSVQyb3I5TFNMdHVQY3RXM0NIR3ZVaGJaZ212MA</guid></item><item><title>两天的燕麦片可以降低胆固醇水平- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2026-01-days-oatmeal-cholesterol.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="success-screen" id="successScreen"&gt;

As it turns out, however, men getting more irritable as they get older probably shouldn't be excused as just a byproduct of aging. In fact, doctors are beginning to take notice and point out that it's not something to be glossed over as a stereotypical trope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Irritable male syndrome is so common among men that doctors are starting to take notice.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2026-01/irritable-male-syndrome-common-doctors-notice.png" alt="Man with irritable male syndrome" title="Doctors Are Beginning To Acknowledge Irritable Male Syndrome" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;New Africa | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/irritable-male-syndrome-ims-is-an-actual-condition-and-it-could-explain-a-lot-goog_l_696931bae4b09fa9c797ddc0" rel="nofollow"&gt;According to HuffPost&lt;/a&gt;, in 2001, Dr. Gerald Lincoln first used the term "irritable male syndrome" (IMS) to describe how a decrease in testosterone in sheep and rams correlated with "increased irritability and aggression." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychologists have since used his findings to identify similar mood changes in men who often have a natural drop in testosterone as they age. Basically, men go through a similar body and mind change as women, and just like with perimenopause and menopause, science is dragging its feet when it comes to exploring these aging changes and how they might impact mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/men/features/irritable-male-syndrome-high-on-stress"&gt;Abraham Morgentaler&lt;/a&gt;, MD, detailed, "They have a shorter fuse. In popular culture, people link male anger with high testosterone, but as a rule, we see it more in men with low testosterone — most commonly when levels are dropping. That’s when men get cranky." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/why-men-bad-telling-how-feel-according-research"&gt;Why Men Are So Bad At Telling You How They Feel, According To Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Irritable male syndrome isn't just characterized by testosterone loss.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2026-01/irritable-male-syndrome-not-just-testosterone-loss.png" alt="Man dealing with more than just testosterone loss associated with irritable male syndrome" title="Doctors Are Beginning To Acknowledge Irritable Male Syndrome" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;baranq | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/irritable-male-syndrome-ims-is-an-actual-condition-and-it-could-explain-a-lot-goog_l_696931bae4b09fa9c797ddc0" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr. Justin Houman&lt;/a&gt; explained the symptoms of IMS to HuffPost as including "mood changes ... lower motivation and feelings of depression, difficulty concentrating or memory lapses, low energy and fatigue, reduced libido, [erectile dysfunction,] loss of muscle mass and strength, increased body fat, and sleep disturbances." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not happening overnight, these fluctuations creep up on men in the same way age takes away the keen eyesight a person had in their youth. It's a slow change. Many are calling the condition male menopause, but just as women shouldn't have to share gender specific medical conditions, neither should men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age and life stressors carry a lot of weight and influence on the physical body and psyche. Therefore, life takes a toll on people, no matter the gender. It can't be avoided, neglected, or repressed when men's issues are valid to feel and talk about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/insecurities-men-hide-wives-afraid-be-seen"&gt;3 Insecurities Most Men Hide From Their Wives Because They're Afraid To Be Seen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Having lowered testosterone has become stigmatized, making men reluctant to talk to their doctors about the changes they experience.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shedding light on irritable male syndrome is integral to improving the health and wellness of men in middle age, which is why podcaster &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/israel.cassol/"&gt;Israel Cassol&lt;/a&gt; is using his platform to talk about his own struggles. He told the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/10/29/influencer-40-wants-acknowledgment-of-male-menopause/"&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt;, "Men shouldn’t see this as a weakness or something shameful. It’s a natural part of life for many, and talking about it helps break the stigma around men’s emotional health." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's vulnerable to admit and accept a diagnosis from any doctor, especially a diagnosis that tells you this is all a part of aging, and simultaneously is looked at societally as somehow emasculating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/testosterone--what-it-does-and-doesnt-do" rel="nofollow"&gt;Harvard Health&lt;/a&gt; noted,  "More than a third of men over age 45 may have reduced levels of testosterone than might be considered normal (though, as mentioned, defining optimal levels of testosterone is tricky and somewhat controversial)." In a nutshell, IMS is more common than we think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The easy way out of this depletion is to start testosterone therapy to bring T back up to a "normal" level. However, as the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/mens-health/in-depth/male-menopause/art-20048056" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt; noted, it's a decision to make after seeing a doctor and doing a full screening. More importantly, this is a health issue that deserves more attention and more research. Remember the years when hormone replacement therapy was controversial for women? Even now, it's still hard for many middle-aged women to be properly diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IMS is much more than just being grumpy. It adds an important layer to the conversation of mental health for men, something that is still woefully disregarded. Being aware that this happens to many both reassures and validates men troubled with identity and body issues that everyone experiences to various degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/annoying-reason-men-cant-multitask-according-science"&gt;The Annoying Reason Men Can Only Seem To Do One Thing At A Time, According To Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emi Magaña is a writer from Los Angeles with a bachelor's in English.

We wanted to start a family. We longed to experience the profound love between parent and child. I also wanted to birth a new life that I thought would redeem my old, a life beautiful enough to motivate me to keep going in the face of psychosis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to combined national survey data collected by the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration from 2008 to 2014,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://answers.childrenshospital.org/parent-mental-illness/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="18% of parents in the U.S." data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69600683e4b07c21634e0510" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://answers.childrenshospital.org/parent-mental-illness/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;18% of parents in the U.S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; had experienced a mental health condition in the previous year.

Multiple.” The attempts blur together in my mind. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tim reached for my hand. I clutched his. The resident’s steel eyes seemed to saw through my skull. “Have you ever had strong beliefs that other people said didn’t make sense?” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Five years ago,” I replied. “I’d stopped my antipsychotic cold turkey because I hated the weight gain.” I did my best to describe the delusions that had traumatized me. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You thought you were being recruited by the CIA?” the resident asked. “And your dad was a criminal mastermind trying to kill you?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Yes.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;I sound batshit crazy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’d been shattered by psychosis— how could I ever be whole enough to bring a child into the world? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The supervising psychiatrist entered. We discussed how I’d resumed the antipsychotic medication, how it had stabilized me and made my happy, healthy life possible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Ma’am, I have a duty to say this,” the doctor said, his brown eyes gentle in a way the resident’s hadn’t been. “Very little is known about this medication in pregnancy.” But, he added, “It seems to cause miscarriages in rats.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like many antipsychotics, my medication, one of the second generation of atypical antipsychotics developed after the initial discovery of Haldol and Thorazine in the 1950s, hadn’t been well studied in pregnancy, he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11695384/#:~:text=Preterm%20birth.,an%20antipsychotic%20drug%20in%20pregnancy.&amp;amp;text=NR-,Spontaneous%20abortion.,likely%20due%20to%20confounding%20factors.&amp;amp;text=Miscarriage.,Further%20research%20is%20recommended.&amp;amp;text=The%20postpartum%20follow%2Dup%20was,and%20fetal%20echocardiography%2C%20were%20performed." role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Some research" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69600683e4b07c21634e0510" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11695384/#:~:text=Preterm%20birth.,an%20antipsychotic%20drug%20in%20pregnancy.&amp;amp;text=NR-,Spontaneous%20abortion.,likely%20due%20to%20confounding%20factors.&amp;amp;text=Miscarriage.,Further%20research%20is%20recommended.&amp;amp;text=The%20postpartum%20follow%2Dup%20was,and%20fetal%20echocardiography%2C%20were%20performed." data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; links atypical antipsychotics to miscarriage; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39234854/#:~:text=The%20adjusted%20odds%20ratios%20(aOR,and%20the%20risk%20of%20miscarriage." role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="other studies" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69600683e4b07c21634e0510" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39234854/#:~:text=The%20adjusted%20odds%20ratios%20(aOR,and%20the%20risk%20of%20miscarriage." data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;other studies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; find no risk. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For me — as for so many women — the dangers of stopping the medication outweighed any potential risk to a baby, he told us. Pregnancy with a psychotic disorder isn’t just complicated by the illness itself, but by the gaps in care and the lifestyle challenges that so often come with it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S295028532300011X#:~:text=Other%20psychosocial%20studies%20have%20supported,24" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="I faced heightened odds " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69600683e4b07c21634e0510" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S295028532300011X#:~:text=Other%20psychosocial%20studies%20have%20supported,24" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I faced heightened odds &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;of developing gestational diabetes, having a preterm birth or delivering an infant with low birth weight.

Tim rubbed my back. His touch couldn’t comfort me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The psychiatrist threw his hands wide. “So many women in our hospital who are on these medications have beautiful babies. But there’s a risk.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I developed mental illness as a teenager and attempted suicide for the first time when I was 21. In the following years, I suffered breakdown after breakdown, until, at age 30, when I stopped my antipsychotic and spiraled into delusions, I received a new diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. My parents sought guardianship and moved me to a group home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But I was resilient. I became medication compliant, moved home and found volunteer work that transitioned into a job. I started running and competed in 5Ks. Seeing my progress, my parents eventually terminated the guardianship. Later, I earned a master’s degree and bought my first home. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I met Tim when I was 34. He was intelligent and funny, gentle and stable — and we fell head over heels for each other. With him, I hoped to start a family. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;During our engagement, on a bright spring day, the daffodils’ yellow stars strewn profusely across the lawn, I told my dad that Tim would make a good father. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“And you’d make a wonderful mom, honey,” he told me. “I wouldn’t have said that even two or three years ago, but you’ve proven me wrong. I couldn’t be happier.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author and her husband pictured during their engagement in 2018.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of course, I worried about passing on my illness. Children of parents with severe mental illnesses have a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3885302/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="1 in 3 chance" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69600683e4b07c21634e0510" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3885302/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1 in 3 chance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of developing a psychotic or major mood disorder by adulthood. Schizoaffective disorder manifests in late adolescence, so I wouldn’t know for nearly two decades whether I had passed on my condition. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tim and I discussed the possibility that sleep deprivation and stress might cause me to destabilize. We also talked about the long-term implications if I required hospitalization during our child’s formative years. Tim once said to me, “I’m scared I’ll have to take care of two people — you and a baby.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I knew support would be crucial. I investigated doulas and child care and enlisted a commitment to help from my parents. I planned to leave my full-time job and work part-time from home. I also took comfort from the examples of friends with mental and physical disabilities who were wonderful parents. They told me that parenting was both the hardest thing they’d ever done and the most rewarding. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Research demonstrates that even people with conditions as serious as mine can make great parents. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/about/policy/parents-disabilities.pdf" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="An eight-year study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69600683e4b07c21634e0510" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.apa.org/about/policy/parents-disabilities.pdf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;&lt;span&gt;An eight-year study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; cited by the American Psychological Association found that the adult children of parents with various disabilities generally showed high self-esteem and had positive childhood experiences. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the clinic, the specialist outlined a plan: I’d gradually taper off several of my medications to prepare my body for pregnancy, while remaining on the vital antipsychotic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Later, back in our apartment, Tim and I talked and talked, weighing the potential risk to my mental health, as well as the risk of miscarriage. We decided to go for it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In April 2020, after the first taper had begun, I found myself sobbing over the sweet potatoes I was slicing for dinner. I could only think of lying down and letting an overdose-induced sleep close over my head forever. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once again, I willed my own death. But this time, I fought. In what has been my only hospitalization in the past nine years, I checked myself into a local behavioral health unit and sobbed myself to sleep. Knowing that I desperately needed to stabilize, I resumed the medication. At that point, I was in no shape to become a mom. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;“Tim once said to me, ‘I’m scared I’ll have to take care of two people — you and a baby.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the years that followed, I researched adoption from foster care and domestic infant adoption. Tim and I attended orientations, and I made endless cold calls to adoption agencies to ask if they would consider facilitating an adoption by a woman with a history of psychiatric hospitalization. Receptionists hung up. I became more strategic. They still hung up. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally, on a late autumn afternoon in 2024, a social worker leveled with me: My severe psychiatric history meant that no agency would adopt to us, despite my years of stability. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The reproductive health needs of women with severe mental illnesses are complex and still &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7971324/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="largely go unmet" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69600683e4b07c21634e0510" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7971324/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;largely go unmet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;But we’re not the only ones for whom the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;need for reproductive psychiatry is pressing.

Not even the antipsychotic, though its effects on pregnancy remained mysterious. I made an appointment to get my IUD removed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By early spring, I felt nauseous. My stomach cramped so badly I clutched a heating pad. My breasts grew larger, and the nipples changed color. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was too soon for a pregnancy test. Still, my primary care doctor said it was possible to have all these symptoms at such an early stage of pregnancy. I was excited. At home, I smiled into Tim’s eyes: “I think you’re going to become a dad.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Days later, my period started. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was sure I had been pregnant. But as the days passed, I worried how I would react if I miscarried again. Could I handle more loss? Or would I spiral until I lost myself? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Throughout that winter and early spring, I’d had nightmares that I gave birth to a child with a psychotic disorder or landed myself back in a psychiatric inpatient unit. I wanted to be brave enough to go out and grab the beautiful life I craved, but deep down, I was terrified.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I reflected on the miracle that Tim and I already shared a happy, stable home. And I was healthy. My mom said to me, during one of the long phone conversations we had that spring, “Meggie, you can choose wellness.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I valued my health even more than my dream of motherhood, I realized. I &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;could&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; choose my own wellness — and wellness would make attaining other dreams possible. Tim and I held each other as I told him I didn’t want to put myself through another try. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s all right, Meggie,” he whispered back, smoothing my hair. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author relaxes with her cat Zooey at home in 2021.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Photo courtesy of Meg LeDuc"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Photo courtesy of Meg LeDuc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are other ways to nurture besides motherhood. On a recent family vacation, I stacked alphabet blocks with my 4-year-old niece, my twin brother’s daughter, into words she read aloud: “car,” “balloon,” “banana.” Her 18-month-old brother bumped a toy truck against my shin. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vroom, vroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. I smiled down at my tiny niece and ruffled her hair. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It spells ‘girl’!” she crowed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Looking at her, my heart breaks. But it also sings. Most times, I take joy in my gorgeously good little life: me, my husband, our brood of rescue kitties. As time goes on, its goodness only grows. Where I once wished for death, I found a desire to live. I gave up my hope of having a baby, but still created the beautiful life I’d dreamed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you or someone you know needs help, call or text 988 or chat &lt;a href="https://988lifeline.org/chat/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="988lifeline.org" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69600683e4b07c21634e0510" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://988lifeline.org/chat/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;988lifeline.org&lt;/a&gt; for mental health support.

man Steven Spinale did something most of us have probably done countless times in our lives, pluck out a pesky ingrown hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However this seemingly harmless decision would be one which would &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/ingrown-hair-sepsis-man-brain-dead-510163-20240322"&gt;change his life forever&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;After removing the ingrown hair from his groin, Steven, then 36, began to feel 'pretty sick' with doctors stumped as to what could be causing his symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It wasn't until the father's health declined so badly that he needed to be put on life support that doctors were able to figure out the full extent of what was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;He'd developed &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/health"&gt;sepsis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Despite a four percent chance of survival, Steven was able to recover (GoFundMe)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;An extreme response to the body fighting off an infection, sepsis causes damage to the body's organs and is nearly always fatal without medical intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Symptoms of sepsis are often difficult to spot, with the NHS &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sepsis/"&gt;advising&lt;/a&gt; that anyone with 'blue, grey, pale or blotchy skin, lips or tongue' or confusion should be taken to A&amp;amp;E for urgent treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;In Steven's case, he'd developed sepsis from a rare bacterial infection after removing the ingrown hair, with the bacteria 'ravaging thru [sic] his body and shutting down all his organs'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The Texas native also caught influenza A, double pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) while in hospital as well as suffering a 'small stroke after the sepsis reached his heart'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Given the sheer number of life-threatening complications, Steven was placed in a medically-induced coma, was likely 'brain dead' and given just a four percent chance of surviving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However in a miraculous turn of events, Steven was able to regain consciousness and recover. His recovery has been documented by family members, who've shared numerous updates on his health via social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;In one &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/tiktok"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; posted in November 2025, his sister Michelle shared various clips of Steven's 'milestones' which include physiotherapy, sitting up in bed eating food and learning to walk again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;More recent photos revealed Steven's life after being discharged from hospital, including going fishing and spending time with family members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"We never lost hope," she wrote in another TikTok which showed photos of him in the ICU and waking up. "And luckily [he’s] alive today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"We never lost hope of faith. And thank God we didn’t because look at him now," she added in another clip.

    &lt;p&gt;If you have ever lifted a weight, you know the routine: challenge the muscle, give it rest, feed it and repeat. Over time, it grows stronger. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, muscles only &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1249/MSS.0b013e3181915670"&gt;grow when the challenge increases over time&lt;/a&gt;. Continually lifting the same weight the same way stops working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might come as a surprise to learn that the brain responds to training in much the same way as our muscles, even though most of us never think about it that way. Clear thinking, focus, creativity and good judgment are built through challenge, when the brain is asked to stretch beyond routine rather than run on autopilot. That slight mental discomfort is often the sign that the brain is actually being trained, a lot like that good workout burn in your muscles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about walking the same loop through a local park every day. At first, your senses are alert. You notice the hills, the trees, the changing light. But after a few loops, your brain checks out. You start planning dinner, replaying emails or running through your to-do list. The walk still feels good, but your brain is no longer being challenged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Routine feels comfortable, but comfort and familiarity alone do not build new brain connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sTqquL0AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;neurologist&lt;/a&gt; who studies brain activity, I use &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2018.11.052"&gt;electroencephalograms&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/a-century-after-the-eeg-was-discovered-it-remains-a-crucial-tool-for-understanding-the-brain-213843"&gt;EEGs&lt;/a&gt;, to record the brain’s electrical patterns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research in humans shows that these rhythms are remarkably dynamic. When someone learns a new skill, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1820296116"&gt;EEG rhythms often become more organized and coordinated&lt;/a&gt;. This reflects the brain’s attempt to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0402820101"&gt;strengthen pathways needed for that skill&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Your brain trains in zones too&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists believed that the brain’s ability to grow and reorganize, called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/541870"&gt;neuroplasticity&lt;/a&gt;, was largely limited to childhood. Once the brain matured, its wiring was thought to be largely fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that idea has been overturned. Decades of research show that adult &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41583-021-00433-z"&gt;brains can form new connections&lt;/a&gt; and reorganize existing networks, under the right conditions, throughout life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the most influential work in this field comes from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2018.04.007"&gt;enriched environment studies in animals&lt;/a&gt;. Rats housed in stimulating environments filled with toys, running wheels and social interaction developed &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0053888"&gt;larger, more complex brains than rats kept in standard cages&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2005.04.009"&gt;Their brains adapted&lt;/a&gt; because they were regularly exposed to novelty and challenge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human studies find similar results. Adults who take on genuinely new challenges, such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2025.1663218"&gt;learning a language&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2018.12.010"&gt;dancing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-13416-2"&gt;practicing a musical instrument&lt;/a&gt;, show measurable &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2025.1663218"&gt;increases in brain volume and connectivity&lt;/a&gt; on MRI scans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The takeaway is simple: Repetition keeps the brain running, but &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2020.00076"&gt;novelty pushes the brain to adapt&lt;/a&gt;, forcing it to pay attention, learn and problem-solve in new ways. Neuroplasticity thrives when the brain is nudged just beyond its comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Tasks that stretch your brain just beyond its comfort zone, such as knitting and crocheting, can improve cognitive abilities over your lifespan – and doing them in a group setting brings an additional bonus for overall health.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/knitting-group-royalty-free-image/1977315544?phrase=knitting%20health&amp;amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;amp;adppopup=true"&gt;Dougal Waters/DigitalVision via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The reality of neural fatigue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like muscles, the brain has limits. It does not get stronger from endless strain. Real growth comes from the right balance of challenge and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the brain is pushed for too long without a break – whether that means long work hours, staying locked onto the same task or making nonstop decisions under pressure – performance starts to slip. Focus fades. Mistakes increase. To keep you going, the brain shifts how different regions work together, asking some areas to carry more of the load. But that extra effort can still &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329212"&gt;make the whole network run less smoothly&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neural fatigue is more than feeling tired. Brain imaging studies show that during prolonged mental work, the networks responsible for attention and decision-making &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-78768-3"&gt;begin to slow down&lt;/a&gt;, while regions that promote &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119812"&gt;rest and reward-seeking take over&lt;/a&gt;. This shift helps explain why mental exhaustion often comes with &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/sleep-loss-rewires-the-brain-for-cravings-and-weight-gain-a-neurologist-explains-the-science-behind-the-cycle-255726?utm_medium=article_clipboard_share&amp;amp;utm_source=theconversation.com"&gt;stronger cravings for quick rewards&lt;/a&gt;, like sugary snacks, comfort foods or mindless scrolling. The result is familiar: slower thinking, more mistakes, irritability and mental fog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the muscle analogy becomes especially useful. You wouldn’t do squats for six hours straight, because your leg muscles would eventually give out. As they work, they build up &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpregu.00114.2004"&gt;byproducts that make each contraction a little less effective&lt;/a&gt; until you finally have to stop. Your brain behaves in a similar way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, in the brain, when the same cognitive circuits are overused, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2022.07.010"&gt;chemical signals build up&lt;/a&gt;, communication slows and learning stalls. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But rest allows those strained circuits to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsycho.2021.108076"&gt;reset and function more smoothly over time&lt;/a&gt;. And taking &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsaa143"&gt;breaks from a taxing activity does not interrupt learning&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, breaks are critical for efficient learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/714015/original/file-20260122-56-itvcr4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Overdoing any task, whether it be weight training or sitting at the computer for too long, can overtax the muscles as well as the brain.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/businesswoman-has-stiffness-in-neck-and-shoulders-royalty-free-image/2137509949?phrase=overworking%20the%20muscles&amp;amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;amp;adppopup=true"&gt;Halfpoint Images/Moment via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The crucial importance of rest&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among all forms of rest, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/STR.0000000000000453"&gt;sleep is the most powerful&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleep is the brain’s night shift. While you rest, the brain takes out the trash through a special cleanup system called the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(18)30318-1"&gt;glymphatic system&lt;/a&gt; that clears away waste and harmful proteins. Sleep also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smrv.2021.101449"&gt;restores glycogen&lt;/a&gt;, a critical fuel source for brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And importantly, sleep is when essential repair work happens. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.5.2S.S6"&gt;Growth hormone surges during deep sleep&lt;/a&gt;, supporting tissue repair. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00424-011-1044-0"&gt;Immune cells regroup&lt;/a&gt; and strengthen their activity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During &lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/public-education/brain-basics/brain-basics-understanding-sleep"&gt;REM sleep&lt;/a&gt;, the stage of sleep linked to dreaming, the brain replays patterns from the day to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11910-013-0430-8"&gt;consolidate memories&lt;/a&gt;. This process is critical not only for cognitive skills like learning an instrument but also for physical skills like mastering a move in sports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, chronic sleep deprivation &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1706694115"&gt;impairs attention&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5665/sleep.4668"&gt;disrupts decision-making&lt;/a&gt; and alters the hormones that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23616"&gt;regulate appetite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2018.02.010"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;. This is why fatigue drives &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2869.2008.00662.x"&gt;sugar cravings and late-night snacking&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleep is not an optional wellness practice. It is a biological requirement for brain performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Exercise feeds the brain too&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-023-03492-8"&gt;Exercise strengthens the brain&lt;/a&gt; as well as the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physical activity &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41574-019-0174-x"&gt;increases levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF&lt;/a&gt;, a protein that acts like fertilizer for neurons. It promotes the growth of new connections, increases blood flow, reduces inflammation and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-023-03492-8"&gt;helps the brain remain adaptable across one’s lifespan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why exercise is one of the strongest &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)00184-9"&gt;lifestyle tools for protecting cognitive health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Train, recover, repeat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important lesson from this science is simple. Your brain is not passively wearing down with age. It is constantly remodeling itself in response to how you use it. Every new challenge and skill you try, every real break, every good night of sleep sends a signal that growth is still expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do not need expensive brain training programs or radical lifestyle changes. Small, consistent habits matter more. Try something unfamiliar. Vary your routines. Take breaks before exhaustion sets in. Move your body. Treat sleep as nonnegotiable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the next time you lace up your shoes for a familiar walk, consider taking a different path. The scenery may change only slightly, but your brain will notice. That small detour is often all it takes to turn routine into training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brain stays adaptable throughout life. Cognitive resilience is not fixed at birth or locked in early adulthood. It is something you can shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want a sharper, more creative, more resilient brain, you do not need to wait for a breakthrough drug or a perfect moment. You can start now, with choices that tell your brain that growth is still the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;As we age, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-mere-sight-of-a-sick-person-can-trigger-our-immune-system"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; gradually declines in function, leaving the body more vulnerable to disease. Scientists have discovered a new way to rejuvenate a key component of immune function, potentially boosting health in later years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard focused on the thymus, a small organ in front of the heart that's crucial for the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprising-immune-cell-discovery-wins-2025-nobel-prize-heres-the-science"&gt;development of T cells&lt;/a&gt;. These immune cells act as guards, identifying and fighting threats such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="188377" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From early adulthood, the thymus shrinks and slows, limiting T cell production. In mouse models, the researchers were able to repurpose part of the liver as a thymus substitute, sending the molecular signals that stimulate T-cell production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tattoos-affect-your-immune-system-in-ways-were-only-beginning-to-understand"&gt;Tattoos Affect Your Immune System in Ways We're Only Beginning to Understand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As we get older, the immune system begins to decline," &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-study-suggests-way-rejuvenate-immune-system-1217"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; MIT neuroscientist Mirco Friedrich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We wanted to think about how can we maintain this kind of immune protection for a longer period of time, and that's what led us to think about what we can do to boost immunity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188380" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188380" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/TCells.jpg" alt="Liver diagram" class="wp-image-188380 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/TCells.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/TCells-600x429.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-188380" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers used the livers of the mice to stimulate T cell production. (Friedrich et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the researchers compared the immune systems of young mice with old mice to identify three key signaling proteins that decline with age: DLL1, FLT3-L, and IL-7. These handle the jobs of turning cells into T cells and keeping those cells healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, an mRNA treatment package was assembled; mRNA (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;messenger ribonucleic acid&lt;/a&gt;) is like a set of instructions for protein production. This treatment was injected repeatedly into the livers of older mice, producing the desired signaling effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The liver is a high-output protein producer, even in old age. What's more, blood leaving the stomach and intestines must pass through the liver, and it's relatively easy to access for treatments like this, making it an ideal target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In older mice given the mRNA treatment for four weeks, there were notable increases in both the number and diversity of T cells. They responded more strongly to vaccinations and were better able to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-breakthrough-treatment-safely-kills-cancer-cells-with-light"&gt;fight off cancer tumors&lt;/a&gt; – signs of a boosted, younger, healthier immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our approach is more of a synthetic approach," &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-study-suggests-way-rejuvenate-immune-system-1217"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; MIT neuroscientist Feng Zhang. "We're engineering the body to mimic thymic factor secretion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the T cell production boost generated through the liver was temporary. This reduces the risk of overstimulating the immune system, which can lead to inflammation and the body &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/nightmares-may-have-an-eerie-link-to-autoimmune-disease"&gt;attacking itself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results are promising, but this needs to be demonstrated to be a viable approach in humans as well as in mice. The researchers plan to expand their study in the future by looking at other types of animals, signal proteins, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprising-immune-cell-discovery-wins-2025-nobel-prize-heres-the-science"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been previous attempts to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/imr.12418"&gt;rejuvenate T cell production&lt;/a&gt;, including putting immune system boosters directly into the bloodstream, often with side effects and risks. These early results suggest this liver-based approach could offer a safe and effective alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we can restore something essential like the immune system, hopefully we can help people stay free of disease for a longer span of their life," &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-study-suggests-way-rejuvenate-immune-system-1217"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Zhang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09873-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Trump assiduously courted R.F.K. Jr.’s support throughout the campaign, so why wouldn’t he put an anti-vaccine crank in charge of American public health? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But nothing in life is as inevitable as all that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Slow Boring</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 11:03:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE5qazhPckxScnhqbU9PeG51VFBQM2E5bE41UWdSemhxeE42R2VCU01uZGFYN2pHY1hNYzlGZUVWUURHTV9uX0hKT3dVdTJERmplOTV5VkpTSzd6UUE2UG5lNml0Z3ZUN3cwUHNxZFJMYw</guid></item><item><title>如果Ozempic不能彻底解决所有问题，该怎么办？ -论点|耶路撒冷德姆萨斯</title><link>https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/what-if-ozempic-doesnt-fix-literally</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div dir="auto" class="body markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Worst Take of the Week is a new occasional column where the author will rant about something we found stupid, annoying, bad, and/or irritating.

I’ve never asked myself “Does chemotherapy make cancer patients happy?” or “Does insulin make diabetics happy?” or “Do malaria medications make &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/790174/estimated-share-of-total-malaria-cases-by-country/?srsltid=AfmBOoqiO8ha-ghDm5z7pzW1pgJ7vqquo9HTqM0dd2HDISOv8i4xaYna" rel&gt;Nigerians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; happy?” because the purpose of these medical advancements is to either save people’s lives or make them healthier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it possible that some cancer or malaria survivors go on to be unhappy? I’m sure that some do, but it would never occur to me to evaluate the effectiveness of chemotherapy on this question. The purpose of chemotherapy is to cure cancer, not to give your life meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/what-if-ozempic-doesnt-fix-literally?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/what-if-ozempic-doesnt-fix-literally?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s worth spending some time talking about how bad obesity is.

Of course, this would be impossible, but the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt; same can be said for obesity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yes, in theory, most every person should be able to lose weight through exercise and diet, but there are a good many theories that don’t pan out in real life. And there are few things more well-validated in the nutritional sciences than the finding that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://hartfordhospital.org/about-hh/news-center/news-detail?articleId=65632" rel&gt;most diets fail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Probably the most widely cited research on the fact that diets usually fail is the boringly but appropriately named “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29156185/" rel&gt;Maintenance of Lost Weight and Long-Term Management of Obesity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While dropping some weight, including pretty substantial weight loss, is certainly possible through a variety of diets, within five years, more than 80% of lost weight will be regained. The entire article went into the physiological and environmental reasons behind this problem, and it’s pretty accessible to nonresearchers, so if you’re interested (and I hope you are, Arthur) you can go read it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One study that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523295362" rel&gt;looked into the roughly 20% of overweight people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; who are successful at losing and keeping at least 10% of their initial body weight found that it requires an extraordinarily high level of willpower. These people are exercising roughly an hour a day and maintaining a low-calorie, low-fat diet with a high degree of vigilance in monitoring their body weight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the facts are incontestable: For &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;whatever&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; reason, the vast majority of people who are desperately trying to lose weight, who are steeped in a society that reminds them constantly of the physical, social, and emotional harms of remaining overweight, are unable to do so. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These facts should make one curious. They should make one interested in new and exciting solutions to this seemingly intractable problem that increasingly afflicts people the world over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many people prefer confirmation bias to curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given these sad facts and the reality of rising obesity rates, GLP-1 drugs are a modern marvel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They help people lose weight, yes, but studies have found that this weight loss is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36216945/" rel&gt;sustained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; with continued treatment. While semaglutide (Ozempic) averages about 15% of mean weight loss, tirzepatide (Zepbound) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35658024/" rel&gt;averages about 20%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and Eli Lilly’s newest drug may even help obese individuals &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/lillys-next-gen-drug-tops-zepbound-weight-loss-late-stage-osteoarthritis-trial-2025-12-11/" rel&gt;lose almost &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/lillys-next-gen-drug-tops-zepbound-weight-loss-late-stage-osteoarthritis-trial-2025-12-11/" rel&gt;30%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/lillys-next-gen-drug-tops-zepbound-weight-loss-late-stage-osteoarthritis-trial-2025-12-11/" rel&gt; of their starting weight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Not only do these drugs help people lose and keep off weight, they reduce the rate of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37952131/" rel&gt;strokes and stroke-related deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, they slow the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38785209/" rel&gt;progression of chronic kidney disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, they cut the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39555826/" rel&gt;incidence of heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and it’s possible they may even help reduce &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2831975" rel&gt;dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2829811" rel&gt;addiction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brooks’ main point is that GLP-1 drugs offer you “weight loss &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; struggle” and that “satisfaction is the joy you get from an accomplishment &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;after struggle.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;He went on to point out that while there’s nothing wrong with taking Ozempic “this is hardly evidence to yourself that you are a person of character and strength.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think many of my previous arguments apply here, but in addition, I think Brooks carries a fatal misunderstanding of how GLP-1 drugs actually work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ozempic and Mounjaro are not magic drugs that make excess weight vanish. Users &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2836527" rel&gt;still need to follow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a diet and exercise plan to achieve their goals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These drugs work to “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/diet-exercise-still-important-when-taking-weight-loss-medication/" rel&gt;reduce food cravings, increase fullness, slow digestion, and help with blood glucose control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.” But as basically any modern human in a developed nation understands, it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5735853/" rel&gt;is possible to eat a lot of food even if you are full&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and have no cravings. And nothing can make you lace up your running shoes or hit the gym; these are still choices individuals have to make. GLP-1 agonists just lower that bar from “nearly impossible” to “possible with reasonable effort.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When normally dieting, people lose weight but then get &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;hungrier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which is a part of why it’s so hard to maintain that consistency. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5108589/" rel&gt;One study found&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that “weight loss leads to a proportional increase in appetite resulting in eating above baseline by ~100kcal/day per kg of lost weight – an amount more than 3-fold larger than the corresponding energy expenditure adaptations.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On Dr. Ashwin Sharma’s great newsletter, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.glp1digest.com/p/glp-1s-are-quietly-killing-your-cravings" rel&gt;GLP-1 Digest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Sharma pointed readers to a “groundbreaking randomized controlled trial” that included scans of “people’s brains in real-time as they looked at images of high-calorie, high sugar foods (think pizza, cakes, burgers etc) while taking tirzepatide, liraglutide, or a placebo.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So yes, current GLP-1 agonists are not magic pills. But, honestly, I’m fine biting the bullet: it would be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; if they were. Even if a single pill could cure you of obesity or heroin addiction or cancer or smoking, unlike Brooks I am not worried about robbing you of whatever satisfaction you might get from the hard slog of quitting unaided.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes things aren’t complicated: good things are good and bad things are bad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/what-if-ozempic-doesnt-fix-literally?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/what-if-ozempic-doesnt-fix-literally?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While I think the question is orthogonal to the main point of GLP-1s, Brooks did highlight a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-75965-2" rel&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; showing that GLP-1 use is associated with increases in reported depression, anxiety, and suicidal behaviors. These are scary findings with reasonably sized effect sizes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After citing this research, Brooks concluded that the “jury’s still out” on whether GLP-1s will raise users’ well-being. But the juries are very much not out. Two of them have come back. And the verdict? Total exoneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In fact, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-requests-removal-suicidal-behavior-and-ideation-warning-glucagon-peptide-1-receptor-agonist-glp" rel&gt;days before&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Brooks published his column highlighting this study, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration published its findings showing that after “comprehensive FDA review” there was “no increased risk” of suicidal ideation or behavior and requesting that the warning label should be removed from these products.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This review went over observational studies, case reports, and clinical trial data, as well as a comprehensive meta-analysis that included 107,910 patients and a retrospective cohort study that included 2.2 million users, neither of which found an increased risk of suicidal ideation or behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Perhaps Brooks could be forgiven for missing this update, but in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/meeting-highlights-pharmacovigilance-risk-assessment-committee-prac-8-11-april-2024" rel&gt;April of 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the European Medicines Agency — a decentralized EU agency responsible for “scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of medicines” — concluded that the existing evidence did not support a causal association between GLP-1s and “suicidal and self-injurious thoughts and actions.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is not even mentioning a May 2025 systematic review and meta-analysis that found GLP-1s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2833558" rel&gt;were not associated with increased risk of psychiatric adverse events&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. There are other papers, but instead of grappling with this research, Brooks poked fun at some rodent studies, quipping that it seems hard to “tell when a rat is feeling depressed.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brooks’ problem is that he seems to think humans lack opportunities to exert willpower and discipline. Yes, overcoming adversity is important to living a good life, but we live in a fallen world, and there will always be adversity — we don’t need to manufacture it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;How do I know this? Because the majority of Americans are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; obese and still have to face the normal human problems of working a job, finding a partner, making and keeping friends, and getting triggered by widely read and badly reasoned articles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A perennial problem for take-slingers, of which I am one, is that most of the important questions are boring. For instance, does B6 compounded tirzepatide perform better than Zepbound? Can newer GLP-1 agonists prevent the loss of muscle mass? Or should the government cover Ozempic-for-all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could list 5000 questions I have for researchers about the science of obesity, and at no point would I alight on: Should we worry that the miracle wonder drug eliminating the leading cause of preventable deaths works too well?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed" class="digestPostEmbed-flwiST"&gt;&lt;div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-flexDirection-column pc-reset"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/the-toxic-modernity-narrative" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;h2 class="pencraft pc-reset color-pub-primary-text-NyXPlw line-height-36-XIK16z font-display-nhmvtD size-30-tZAWf_ weight-bold-DmI9lw reset-IxiVJZ"&gt;The toxic modernity narrative&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-flexDirection-row pc-mobile-flexDirection-column pc-gap-16 pc-paddingTop-16 pc-reset"&gt;&lt;div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-flexDirection-column pc-reset flex-grow-rzmknG"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-QiPycG"&gt;On Tuesday, The Guardian published the best news I’ve heard all year: The microplastics panic was based on dubious science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed" class="digestPostEmbed-flwiST"&gt;&lt;div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-flexDirection-column pc-reset"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/most-americans-support-some-vaccines" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;h2 class="pencraft pc-reset color-pub-primary-text-NyXPlw line-height-36-XIK16z font-display-nhmvtD size-30-tZAWf_ weight-bold-DmI9lw reset-IxiVJZ"&gt;Most Americans support some vaccines.

			&lt;p&gt;High blood sugar spikes after meals could be a contributing factor &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-gene-may-be-responsible-for-over-90-of-alzheimers-cases"&gt;to Alzheimer's risk&lt;/a&gt;, according to a new study that gives us more insight into the relationship between  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="189166" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, insulin resistance, and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jdi.12087"&gt;have found&lt;/a&gt; that diabetes and dementia can be connected in some cases. But whether one is causing the other, and what biological mechanisms are involved, remain areas that scientists are still investigating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, researchers from the UK ran an analysis of a large genetic dataset covering 357,883 individuals, finding that people with a relatively higher level of blood sugar (glucose) in the two hours after eating were also 69 percent more likely to develop &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/garlic-could-be-a-secret-weapon-to-keep-down-your-glucose-and-cholesterol"&gt;Garlic Could Be a Secret Weapon to Keep Down Your Glucose And Cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This finding could help shape future prevention strategies, highlighting the importance of managing blood sugar not just overall, but specifically after meals," &lt;a href="https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2026/01/14/blood-sugar-spikes-linked-to-higher-risk-of-alzheimers-disease/amp/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist Andrew Mason, from the University of Liverpool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used a technique called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_randomization"&gt;Mendelian Randomization&lt;/a&gt; (MR) to analyze the data. Instead of actually taking measurements of post-meal blood sugar, they looked for people with genes known to be associated with sugar spikes after eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_189169" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189169" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/AlzheimersGraph.jpg" alt="Alzheimer's risk graph" class="wp-image-189169 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/AlzheimersGraph.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/AlzheimersGraph-600x248.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-189169" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The data showed a significantly increased risk of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="189166" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; connected to 2-hour post-load glucose (2hPG). (Mason et al., &lt;em&gt;Diabetes Obes. Metab.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this looks at the genetics that each person is born with, it takes out the influence of environmental factors and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-one-critical-thing-you-can-do-to-cut-your-risk-of-dementia"&gt;other health conditions&lt;/a&gt;, allowing cause-and-effect to be determined more confidently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there was a strong connection between post-meal blood sugar spikes and Alzheimer's, no link was found for standard glucose or insulin levels, or insulin resistance, for either Alzheimer's or dementia overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, brain scans carried out on a subset of the participants showed no relationship between glucose or insulin traits and changes in brain or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brains-memory-center-never-stops-making-neurons-study-confirms"&gt;hippocampus size&lt;/a&gt;, or more white matter damage – the implication being that something more subtle is happening to connect sugar spikes with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Previous observational and MR studies &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-0905"&gt;have suggested&lt;/a&gt; that 2-hour post-load glucose is a glycaemic trait that strongly predicts poorer cardiovascular outcomes," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/dom.70353"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that the genetic predisposition for this marker of postprandial glucose is also associated with an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's still not clear why a post-meal burst in sugar raises the risk of dementia, but we know that the brain &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2337/db20-0895"&gt;relies on glucose&lt;/a&gt;, just like the rest of the body. It's possible that some kind of inflammation or stress is being caused in brain cells after meals, and further down the line, targeting it could lead to dementia treatments or prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" class="alignnone wp-image-189354 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there's a notable caveat to the research: the team was unable to replicate the findings in an older genetic dataset of 111,326 people – perhaps because of differences in how the participants were selected, the researchers suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original UK Biobank dataset used tends to skew towards healthier participants and individuals of a higher socioeconomic status, and exclusively draws on people of White British ancestry, so more work is required to test this idea in more diverse groups of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We first need to replicate these results in other populations and ancestries to confirm the link and better understand the underlying biology," &lt;a href="https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2026/01/14/blood-sugar-spikes-linked-to-higher-risk-of-alzheimers-disease/amp/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; genetic epidemiologist Vicky Garfield, from the University of Liverpool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If validated, the study could pave the way for new approaches to reduce dementia risk in people with diabetes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/dom.70353"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Guinea-Bissau experienced a coup in November, and top leaders were recently replaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A team of research experts at the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, at Nantote’s request, will travel to Guinea-Bissau to help officials review the study. Officials from Denmark and the US have also been invited to review the trial, Jean Kaseya, director-general of the Africa CDC, said at the press meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The decision to halt the trial is not for international organizations or foreign countries to determine, Kaseya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s the sovereignty of the country,” he said. “I don’t know what will be this decision, but I will support the decision that the minister will make.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Officials with the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have called into question the credibility of the Africa CDC, after officials with the organization &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/15/hepatitis-b-vaccines-study-africa-cancel" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; the study was cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“To be clear, the trial will proceed as planned,” Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, said in a statement on Wednesday. He said the Africa CDC was waging “a public-relations campaign aimed to shape public perception rather than engaging with the scientific facts”. When asked by the Guardian, he offered no proof of either claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;An HHS official also called the Africa CDC “a powerless, fake organization attempting to manufacture credibility by repeating its claims publicly”, adding that the organization was “not a reliable source”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kaseya said he had spoken to senior HHS officials, who were unaware of the statement, and he pointed to the Africa CDC’s key role in responding to outbreaks with global implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s very important to fund research that Africans actually want,” said Abdulhammad Babatunde, a medical doctor and global health researcher in Nigeria. “Africans want to solve Africa’s problems, not satisfy the curiosity of the funders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers would have given hepatitis B vaccines to 7,000 infants at birth and withheld the vaccines for another 7,000 infants until six weeks of age in order to study the overall health effects of giving the vaccines alongside other shots. Nearly one in five adults and about 11% of young children in Guinea-Bissau have hepatitis B – putting them at high risk of severe illness and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This is not acceptable,” said Babatunde of the study’s design. “To prevent things like the Tuskegee study and others, the control group has to get the standard of care, and the intervention group should get [potentially] better care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-b" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; giving the hepatitis B vaccine to all newborns within 24 hours of birth. Infants in Guinea-Bissau currently receive the shot at six weeks of age, but the doses will roll out to all newborns in 2028 in order to close gaps in care standards. “The current reason why the vaccine is not achieving coverage in Guinea-Bissau is because there’s no funding, and the funding should try to promote the vaccine, not use children as lab rats,” Babatunde said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Officials in an imbalanced power structure may be intimidated, he said. “It might be a very tough call for the officials in Guinea-Bissau, depending on what they stand to lose if they restrict the study. At this moment, it’s [time] for other African member states to come support Guinea-Bissau, to maintain their sovereignty and protect the children of Guinea-Bissau.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When deciding whether a revised version of the study will move forward, “the most important voice” is that of Guinea-Bissau’s ministry of health, which is responsible for protecting the health of all Bissau-Guineans, said Gavin Yamey, professor of global health at the Duke Global &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Institute. “So hearing from ministry officials today is hugely important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The confusion in Guinea-Bissau comes back to how the trial was given the green light, said Nantote, who spoke in Portuguese through a translator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;An early version of the study was approved by Guinea-Bissau’s six-person ethics committee, Comité Nacional de Ética em Pesquisa em Saúde (CNEPS), on 5 November, &lt;a href="https://www.bandim.org/protocol-for-the-trial-the-broader-health-effects-of-hepatitis-b-vaccination-at-birth-an-investigator-initiated-randomized-controlled-trial-in-guinea-bissau/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Danish researchers. The researchers have since made updates that have not been approved by the committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Guinea-Bissau ethics committee, CNEPS, initially approved the study, according to an individual who identified himself to the Guardian as the interim director of CNEPS. The study did not mention that infants would go unvaccinated, he said – but the ethical concern is that the vaccine would be withheld from some newborns at birth, when it is most needed. No further changes have been made to the design of the trial because it was “suspended” by the country’s ministry of health, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We think that they did not meet and they did not address this issue adequately,” Nantote said of the ethics committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Danish researchers did not appear to seek approval from ethics boards in Denmark or the US, though the Helsinki declaration requires approval from research ethics committees in both the sponsoring and host countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The HHS did not respond to the Guardian’s questions on ethical concerns and its characterization of the Africa CDC. The researchers did not respond to inquiries about the trial’s cancellation or questions about their research. The HHS, the researchers, and the University of Southern Denmark did not respond to inquiries about whether US or Danish ethical committees were consulted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nantote and Kaseya both highlighted the challenges to health in Guinea-Bissau. Less than a quarter of the country has access to basic services such as water and sanitation. Poverty and food insecurity are persistent. With limited access to healthcare, maternal mortality is high, and malaria is a leading cause of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The authorities of Guinea-Bissau, they know that,” Kaseya said. “They are doing their best to address that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 11:02:00

that babies receive a vitamin K shot at birth to protect them from severe bleeding in early life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;These recommendations have significantly reduced vitamin K deficiency bleeding. Without this injection at birth, babies are over 80 times more likely to develop severe bleeding, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vitamin-k-deficiency/faq/index.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;However, in recent years, health care professionals say more parents are refusing vitamin K shots for their newborns. Additionally, a study published earlier this month found that the proportion of newborns who did not receive a vitamin K shot has nearly doubled in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Doctors told ABC News this trend is very concerning and warned that foregoing this shot at birth puts babies at higher risk for life-threatening bleeding early in life that can have debilitating or deadly consequences.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;What is vitamin K, and why do babies need it at birth? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Vitamin K is necessary to help the body form clots appropriately, but babies are born with very small amounts of this vitamin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This puts them at increased risk of a condition called vitamin K deficiency bleeding, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vitamin-k-deficiency/fact-sheet/index.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;To prevent this bleeding, a vitamin K injection has been recommended for newborns in the U.S. since the early 1960s. It's given as a single, intramuscular shot soon after birth.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Vitamin K is a critical factor for clotting the blood, so the best way that we can prevent bleeding in newborn babies is to give them a shot of vitamin K," Dr. Kristan Scott, a neonatologist at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told ABC News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Since this injection became standard of care, doctors say it is now very rare for babies to experience vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the U.S., but they worry more babies will suffer from bleeding complications as more parents refuse the shot.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"It was a really successful public health intervention that decreased the likelihood infants were going to have bleeds, whether that be spontaneous in their head or abdomen or following a procedure like a circumcision," Dr. Katharine Clouser, a pediatric hospital medicine provider at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, told ABC News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Clouser explained that in addition to babies having low levels of vitamin K at birth, they don't get enough from breast milk or formula, making this early injection important for bleeding prevention as early as possible.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;That protection extends until babies have introduced enough solids in their diet that contain higher levels of vitamin K, which is usually around 6 months old, Clouser said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Why are fewer newborns receiving vitamin K? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Doctors told ABC News that, in recent years, more parents have been refusing or questioning the necessity of a vitamin K injection at birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Clouser said that within her group at the hospital, along with discussions among groups across the country, "many people are anecdotally seeing that we're having more discussions about families who are refusing." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;She continued, "Many pediatricians, and even those who are practicing general pediatrics outside in an office, they're often counseling these families before the baby is born, meeting them before they're born and having a lot of these discussions, which we were not needing to have prior to the last couple of years." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Some of the refusals have been fueled by misinformation, such as fears the preservative in the shot could harm children, or distrust in the medical system, the doctors say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Parents may have also confused the vitamin injection with a vaccine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Vitamin K is not a vaccine, it's a supplement," Scott said. "Vitamin K is just a vitamin K supplement and is safe for babies." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;A recent study, published in the medical journal &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2842444?guestAccessKey=94d98e67-297d-479f-a0ad-9b3daee96709&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=120825" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;JAMA&lt;/a&gt;, for which Scott was a lead researcher, found an ongoing drop in newborns receiving the protective shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Scott and other researchers analyzed more than 5 million health records from 2017 to 2024. They found that in 2024, 5.2% of newborns did not receive a vitamin K injection at birth compared to about 3% in 2017.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This equates to nearly 190,000 babies who did not receive a vitamin K shot in 2024, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr038.pdf" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;based on population estimates.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"[This] might sound like a small increase, but it's a really significant increase in the number of families who are refusing the injectable vitamin K," Clouser, who was not involved in the study, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Scott said many medical colleagues have shared anecdotes that they are seeing more babies with vitamin K deficiency bleeding as more parents refuse this shot.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"What's concerning is that that number could potentially continue to increase, and then we are going to have a larger number of babies that, unfortunately, are at risk of vitamin K deficiency bleeding," Scott said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Numerous studies that have been done over decades have ruled out harms such as a link between the vitamin K shot and childhood cancer, the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vitamin-k-deficiency/faq/index.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;CDC says&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Doctors recommend that parents talk to a trusted health care provider or pediatrician before making a decision to refuse vitamin K, to better understand the benefits of the shot and the risks of refusing it.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Clouser said giving a vitamin K injection at birth is a very common practice around the globe.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We have a ton of safety data over years and years and years of these formulations, and in fact, we give a smaller dose than we used to, knowing that we have found a really effective dose." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;What are the risks of not receiving vitamin K at birth? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Bleeding can happen anywhere in the body without adequate vitamin K, but one of the most feared complications is bleeding that occurs in or surrounding the brain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Any brain bleed can be life-threatening and, if it's not life-threatening, it can potentially lead to permanent disability for the rest of that baby's life," Dr. Leah Croll, assistant professor of neurology at SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, told ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Croll explained that babies are at increased risk for brain bleeding because the blood vessels in and surrounding the brain grow rapidly early in life.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Those growing arteries and veins can be more likely to break and bleed, and that can cause very devastating consequences that can be potentially permanent," she said. "I'm very, very concerned to learn that parents are potentially electing to opt out of vitamin K administration at birth." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Croll went on, "The idea that this decision could have these consequences, that the baby is then left to deal with for the rest of their life, is really almost hard to wrap your mind around." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Scott said excessive bleeding from the umbilical cord or after any procedure, such as a circumcision, is also a common complication of vitamin K deficiency bleeding. One &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1477513124006752" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; found that vitamin K injection after birth reduced the risk of severe bleeding by sixfold after circumcision.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Meanwhile, doctors say the risks of the vitamin K injection itself are rare and minimal. The risk of complications from not receiving a vitamin K shot at birth far outweighs the risks of the injection itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"There is a risk of a local redness or irritation from an injection because it is an injection, but beyond that, there are really minimal harms to giving vitamin K," Scott said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;An oral formulation of vitamin K exists, but it is riskier to use in place of the intramuscular injection, doctors say. Instead of a single shot, oral vitamin K would have to be given in multiple doses for weeks early in the baby's life to offer protection from bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Truthfully, we don't know how much of the oral vitamin K a baby would be absorbing. And so, to truly use evidence to prevent risk in vitamin K deficiency bleeding, we should be giving the intramuscular shot," Scott said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Clouser said that doctors have evidence of what can happen when vitamin K stops being used. In the early 1980s, some hospitals in England stopped providing vitamin K as a routine recommendation due to an alleged association between the vitamin K shot and childhood cancer, and it was only recommended for children at high risk for bleeds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Following this move, cases of vitamin K deficiency bleeding increased among newborns in England, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1421901/#:~:text=Abstract,the%20respective%2095%25%20confidence%20intervals." target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;research found&lt;/a&gt;. The oral formulation of vitamin K was less effective, eventually leading to revised recommendations in favor of the shot, given universally for all babies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Oftentimes, families are not receiving the whole story, right?" Clouser said. "They hear that England paused it for a while, but don't know what happened afterward. And so, I think that parents are really wanting to have more information and they don't know who they can trust." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I think that what we need to recognize is that a trusted pediatrician, your trusted [obstetrician] are all recommending this vitamin K injection," she said.

I dashed it out in about 10 minutes - how for the first time in my 20-year career, I ended up using notes while doing live TV news thanks to the perimenopause brain fog. I didn't expect many replies.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;To my surprise, it sparked a national conversation. I was overwhelmed with wonderfully supportive messages – nearly 400 comments on LinkedIn and dozens of private messages, and hundreds more beneath &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gpkenx9dzo" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;a piece about it&lt;/a&gt; on the BBC News website. Many of them followed similar lines: calling me "brave" for speaking out. Or thanking me for "normalising" brain fog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;I didn't feel particularly brave (or normal!) at the time - but it did spell out to me just how much shame and stigma was attached to some of the symptoms of perimenopause and menopause, even though it affects pretty much half the population at some point in their life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Hollywood stars like Oprah Winfrey and Halle Berry have spoken out about their own experiences of menopause and its impact, as have TV presenters Davina McCall and Lorraine Kelly. Gwyneth Paltrow called for a "rebrand" of menopause back in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And there have been some changes. For example, menopause screening is to be officially incorporated into &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cq50z185d78o" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;NHS health checks in England&lt;/a&gt; offered to women over 40 from this year. Plus, an Employment Relations Bill means that UK employers of 250 or more need to have "menopause action plans". This comes into effect from April 2027 (and on a voluntary basis from this April).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Yet a self-selecting survey of around 1,600 women, published in October by University College London, found that more than 75% felt that they are not well-informed enough about menopause. Which suggests that something is going amiss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/646a/live/413a4630-e7cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/646a/live/413a4630-e7cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/646a/live/413a4630-e7cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/646a/live/413a4630-e7cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/646a/live/413a4630-e7cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/646a/live/413a4630-e7cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/646a/live/413a4630-e7cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/646a/live/413a4630-e7cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images for BAFTA Gwyneth Paltrow " class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Getty Images for BAFTA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Gwyneth Paltrow called for a "rebrand" of the menopause back in 2018&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;What's more, many women say there is still stigma surrounding menopause and feel they cannot openly talk about the menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;One woman in her 60s, an academic specialising in social policy, messaged me to say that she had started making light of her "menopausal moments" around female colleagues. But it was still "embarrassing," she added - especially when she forgets some specific policy terms in her area of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Yet concealing symptoms, or masking menopause, can be draining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"The energy expended in masking or making up for the challenges women face will often further deplete reserves and reduce thresholds for overwhelm," says Fionnuala Barton, a GP and certified menopause specialist with the British Menopause Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This, she argues, could potentially increase the risk of burnout.

There are an estimated four million women aged 45 to 55 employed in the UK, according a government report published in 2024 – this is the most common window for menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Jo Brewis, professor of people and organisations at The Open University Business School, says that when people mask symptoms at work, this can lead to a set of what economists call intensive margin costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"In other words, the effort involved creates an extra burden for those affected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Some may leave their jobs altogether. An estimated one in 10 women, aged between 40 and 55, working through menopause have left a job because of their symptoms, according to a report from The Fawcett Society in 2022, which analysed data from a survey of around 4,000 UK women carried out by Savanta ComRes research consultancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a2d/live/e1e5ddb0-e7cf-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a2d/live/e1e5ddb0-e7cf-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a2d/live/e1e5ddb0-e7cf-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a2d/live/e1e5ddb0-e7cf-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a2d/live/e1e5ddb0-e7cf-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a2d/live/e1e5ddb0-e7cf-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a2d/live/e1e5ddb0-e7cf-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a2d/live/e1e5ddb0-e7cf-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="FilmMagic via Getty Images Halle Berry attends a red carpet event

For example, the Japanese word for menopause, "konenki", means renewal and energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;There, it's sometimes described as a "second spring" - which nods to a positive transition into a different phase of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr Megan Arnot, honorary research fellow in evolutionary anthropology at University College London, says: "Many countries still carry a stigma around menopause, similar to the UK, though it seems attitudes here have begun to shift in recent years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;However, she suggests there are cultures and countries where menopause is framed more positively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"In many indigenous communities, including Native American and Mayan cultures, menopause is seen as a transition into wisdom and leadership, granting women greater respect and influence […] Similarly, among Indigenous Australian communities, postmenopausal women often become key cultural educators and spiritual guides."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/16c7/live/28860150-e7d0-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/16c7/live/28860150-e7d0-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/16c7/live/28860150-e7d0-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/16c7/live/28860150-e7d0-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/16c7/live/28860150-e7d0-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/16c7/live/28860150-e7d0-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/16c7/live/28860150-e7d0-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/16c7/live/28860150-e7d0-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images A woman walks over a crossing in Tokyo

Problems. We never ask them, did anything change during this time that was positive for you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"If you only ask questions about negative things, you're going to have very negative perceptions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She spent ten years living and working in Japan, and talking to women there left her with "a sense of potential and hope for the next phase of [her] life".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Admittedly, I don't currently share this view - and if my husband said that to me right now, I couldn't guarantee his safety. But perhaps there is something in the idea of, instead of fixating on the rollercoaster of symptoms, considering the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;No 'one size fits all' answer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Menopause has long been big business: there are dietary supplements, symptom trackers, therapeutic headbands, and life coaches all specialising in it. My targeted social media feeds are full of adverts for midlife natural remedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The menopause market was estimated to be worth more than $17bn (£13bn) in 2024, and is projected to reach more than $24bn (£18bn) by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But often none of this is enough by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;When it comes to the workplace, Brewis stresses that employers need to be careful about how they offer support. In her view, line managers need specific training to be able to support their teams, for example, in having sensitive conversations and working out reasonable adjustments for individuals. She adds that clearly identifying menopause as a legitimate reason for absence is also important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Some people will never want to disclose their menopausal status at work, no matter how compassionate or supportive their organisation is, and that is absolutely their prerogative," she adds. "But effective menopause initiatives can and should make disclosure easier and reduce this stigma."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/facb/live/5ab0dec0-e7d0-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/facb/live/5ab0dec0-e7d0-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/facb/live/5ab0dec0-e7d0-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/facb/live/5ab0dec0-e7d0-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/facb/live/5ab0dec0-e7d0-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/facb/live/5ab0dec0-e7d0-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/facb/live/5ab0dec0-e7d0-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/facb/live/5ab0dec0-e7d0-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Universal Images Group via Getty Images Photograph of Dr Margaret Mead" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Margaret Mead, an anthropologist from the US known for her work on gender roles, coined the term "post-menopausal zest"&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Ultimately, I've found that attitude plays a crucial role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It was Margaret Mead, a pioneering anthropologist from the US, who coined the term "post-menopausal zest", more than 70 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Back in the 1950s, she said: "There is no greater power in the world than the zest of a postmenopausal woman."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;So for now, that positive thinking is what many of us must cling to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;As for me, I'm going to hold onto that for as long as this lasts, and channel "konenki" as well - and take HRT. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But the outpouring of support and conversations sparked by my brain fog moment has shown me another, even more comforting fact too: that I am definitely not alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;i id="additional-reporting:-harriet-whitehead" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;Additional reporting: Harriet Whitehead&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;i id="top-image-credit:-getty-images" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;Top image credit: Getty Images&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/bbcindepth" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;&lt;i id="bbc-indepth" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;BBC InDepth&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="is-the-home-on-the-website-and-app-for-the-best-analysis,-with-fresh-perspectives-that-challenge-assumptions-and-deep-reporting-on-the-biggest-issues-of-the-day.-you-can-now-sign-up-for-notifications-that-will-alert-you-whenever-an-indepth-story-is-published--" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt; is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

There's an reaction in our brains that says "you like this", but why are different stimulus different for different people. Why do I like margaritas, but my husband likes whiskey? Why do I like silver and my friend likes gold? Are there genetic markers for "likes opera"? Why do we not like things and then "develop a taste" for them later?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm sure someone has studied it. But I'm tired, and "tacos are good" is good enough for me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C0mpoundFr4cture:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My guess is subtle differences thanks to genetic diversity. If one person has a taste for poisonous berries, and another likes cooked meat, then one's going to survive longer and live a healthier life than the other. Same as slight variations in animals coat colours and markings has adapted to them to blend in almost perfectly.

Like electricity is moving there. Not like it's an electric shock, more like an electric wave. Since then it happens several times a month. Only this specific finger. Asked a doctor and he said he didn't know but it was not a real issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I guess I will never know. But I want to believe I'm becoming some kind of X-Men. In a few years I might be able to light a bulb with my left hand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AffectionateExcuse5:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Might be neuropathy? Apparently if you lean on your elbow too much it can cause weird sensations in your ring or pinky finger.

I still see it everywhere daily but I mostly ignore it now. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It will be the change I get back from the corner store, the suggested tip on a receipt, the toll for a road, multiple license plates throughout the day, randomly marked on trucks or part of a logo, random dialogue in a show I'm watching, or I'll randomly look at my phone or wake up suddenly at that time. Hell, one time I was working on a friend's vehicle when I noticed the number embossed in huge letters on the side of their engine. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The number shows up everywhere and I'd like to think it's just trained pattern recognition but sometimes it's just spooky how often it shows up. I used to try to take pictures or notes of all the instances but I started to feel crazy. I might be but like I said, I mostly ignore it now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beth_Pleasant:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My birthday is 9/19 and I always seem to look at the clock when it's 9:19.

One week was a matchbox Lamborghini. Red and green. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I took it from the box and rolled it exactly once. It went under the couch and we all heard it hit the baseboard. I moved the couch. It wasn't there. There was nothing under behind or near for it to get lost behind. Flipped the couch. No joy. Looked everywhere. We all did. For an hour. Moved cushions. Mom was late for work, we were so weirded out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next year they replaced the couch and we took the chance to tear the whole thing apart, even breaking the frame until it was no longer recognizable as a couch. Never found it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;30 years later I went on eBay and bought another one, so I could feel square with the universe.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1qhvx73/what_is_a_small_everyday_mystery_in_your_life/o0pyuij/" target="_blank"&gt; DanielStripeTiger &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-11659-75/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9975559"&gt;  &lt;p id="9975559" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/697318507590c_d9wow6rmw8wc1-jpeg__700.jpg" alt="Smartphone mysteriously standing upright on carpet in a home hallway, evoking curiosity and unsolved mysteries." title="Smartphone mysteriously standing upright on carpet in a home hallway, evoking curiosity and unsolved mysteries."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I’ll put something down in a place that makes perfect sense at the time. Not absent minded…. Fully intentional. Then later, when I need it, that place feels completely foreign…. Like I can remember the decision, just not the logic behind it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The object turns up eventually, always somewhere reasonable. That’s the unsettling part. Past me wasn’t careless. Past me was operating under a rule set current me no longer has access to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I search…..annoyed, until I find it and move on without interrogating the version of me who clearly knew something I didn’t bother to write down. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Same [thing] use to happen while setting up a password earlier now password managers come in handy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;irthdaycheesecake9:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have ADHD and I am very liberal with the “find my phone” function on my FitBit.

It frankly bothers me but more investigation would be above my skill level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hillbillysuv:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's almost certainly an electrified leverset, or electric lock of some kind. I install them sometimes as part of my job. It's most likely a "fail secure" type that will lock if the power goes off. It could be part of a lockdown system or simply an old badge/keypad access system that someone has decided should be left open. Or it's a fail safe version that they're keeping locked until it's badged, or one of a dozen other scenarios.

Ghost light.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LittleMissTaken:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Could also be a bug walking across/flying around/living in the sensors. The way a lot of those types of motion detectors work is by sending out little beams of infrared light (think of it like a series of 3 lasers arranged like this \ | / that are shooting out the beams) and detecting when more than 1 of them are blocked. Usually something small would never break more than one beam at a time, but something small and very close can.&lt;br&gt;I worked at an alarm company a while back (basically like ADT but for commercial businesses rather than homes) and one of the most common reasons a motion alarm would go off over and over was that there were bugs in or around the detector.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1qhvx73/what_is_a_small_everyday_mystery_in_your_life/o0n51cd/" target="_blank"&gt; CouchKakapo &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/3qyat0/ghost_in_the_garden_yesterday_late_afternoon/" target="_blank"&gt; reddit &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-11659-32/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9975601"&gt;  &lt;p id="9975601" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;The silverware at my job constantly goes missing in an alternating pattern.

And this needs doing maybe every 10d? And how much time do you spend in position to observe them making that trip? Couple hours a week? It's simply long odds that you are out or look out the window at the same time they are bringing in groceries. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;Also, back before I lost my health I was very hyper and anything I could do with exercise instead of machines I did. Walking to get groceries instead of driving meant bringing home a backpack full of food fairly often rather than a whole cart of food more rarely. To a neighbor a person with a backpack on won't register as "grocery run". Maybe others stash their purchases in the shelf and pocket of their baby's pram. There are probably other unintentional grocery concealment methods that I am unaware of too. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1qhvx73/what_is_a_small_everyday_mystery_in_your_life/o0naeaw/" target="_blank"&gt; TheCatInside13 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/17912z0/comment/k53o93i/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank"&gt; reddit &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-11659-62/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9975657"&gt;  &lt;p id="9975657" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;What is bothering my boyfriend to make him seem distant and unreachable.

&lt;p id="07cadae6-5fb5-4f63-ad84-b0b6b08988b3"&gt;One of the most noticeable effects of spending a lot of time sitting is sore hips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s because sitting for long periods of time shortens the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Hip_Flexors" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Hip_Flexors" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;hip flexor muscles&lt;/a&gt;—which run down the front of your pelvis and groin and attach the bottom of your body to your torso—and leaves your range of motion reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="07cadae6-5fb5-4f63-ad84-b0b6b08988b3-2"&gt;There are lots of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/flexibility/an-orthopedic-physical-therapist-says-you-should-be-doing-these-three-hip-flexor-stretches-to-improve-your-mobility" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/flexibility/an-orthopedic-physical-therapist-says-you-should-be-doing-these-three-hip-flexor-stretches-to-improve-your-mobility"&gt;stretches&lt;/a&gt; you can do to lengthen tight hip flexors, you also need to build strength in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personal trainer &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://www.jordanlanghough.com/" target="_blank" data-url="http://www.jordanlanghough.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;Jordan Langhough&lt;/a&gt; has one simple move that she swears by to increase strength in the affected area. It’s called the seated leg lift and yes, it is painfully ironic that a move to overcome a problem caused by sitting is performed seated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Langhough explains that seated leg lifts are particularly useful if you also experience lower back pain, because they don’t put any extra stress on that area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Seated leg lifts are amazing for activating the hip flexors and lower abdominal muscles, which are a part of your deep core,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because this move uses bodyweight and is performed seated, it’s perfect for all types of people looking to improve their hip mobility and strength—it doesn’t require an advanced level of fitness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-qupHXVTX5378D2XG87pKDH" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-qupHXVTX5378D2XG87pKDH slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She goes on to add: “By strengthening the hips and core, seated leg lifts can improve posture, hip mobility and flexibility, and increase lower-body stability and balance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about exercise frequency, Langhough says: “I think 10 reps per side is great as long as your body allows. You shouldn't feel fatigued with that rep count. You can do your reps any time of day or as part of your workout routine, warm-up or cool-down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-to-do-a-seated-leg-lift" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-a-seated-leg-lift"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do a seated leg lift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="youtube-video youtube-facade" data-nosnippet id="8FW41cernwQ"&gt;

Her esophagus was surgically detached from her stomach for over a year. Now that it is reattached, she undergoes "stretching" of her esophagus to curb reflux and vomiting. She has some short-lived improvement so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I struggle to understand how such a severe condition occurs and what the prognosis can be. Would you explain?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— J.H.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear J.H.:&lt;/strong&gt; If you're really saying what I think you're saying, I am very surprised. A diverting esophagostomy is a procedure where the esophagus is truly detached from the stomach. Of course, this would mean that all food and water would have to come through a tube, such as a gastric tube that is placed through the abdominal wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I have never seen this procedure done, but my reading says that it is done primarily in people with neurological problems where there is no other choice or those who have failed other treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When lifestyle treatments alone fail, standard medical treatments for reflux disease include medications to reduce acid and promote food to go out of the stomach into the intestines. If people do not do well with these, standard surgical treatments include fundoplication, which tightens the lower esophageal sphincter (the muscular valve-like structure at the bottom of the esophagus).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There are several surgical approaches to do this, including both laparoscopic and endoscopic options. My experience with these has been generally favorable. A recent procedure, magnetic sphincter augmentation, has been shown to have similar effectiveness, and I have had a few patients (and several readers) write in to tell me that they have also been generally pleased with this treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When all other surgical treatments have failed, esophagostomy has been attempted, but experts recommend a very careful consideration beforehand. Complications include a stricture (a partial blockage of the esophagus), which needs to be treated through stretching it, usually with a balloon procedure. This may be what is happening with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; A recent letter from a patient who had a benign kidney tumor that was removed along with one of their kidneys got me thinking. What about someone like myself (and many others) who have a horseshoe kidney? Is this a situation where whatever affects one of the kidneys affects both? How is this handled?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— O.V.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear O.V.:&lt;/strong&gt; A horseshoe kidney is, indeed, shaped like a horseshoe. Instead of two kidneys developing separately, one horseshoe kidney is formed by the kidneys fusing across the midline. It is surprisingly common (1 in 500 people) and often unrecognized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Although people with horseshoe kidneys are at a higher risk for kidney stones and infection, no specific action beyond careful monitoring is needed. People with a horseshoe kidney should avoid excess anti-inflammatory drugs and should promptly seek attention for urinary symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Because it is a single kidney, the person obviously cannot have their single kidney removed without kidney replacement therapy, such as dialysis or a transplant. A tumor of a horseshoe kidney would ideally be treated through the removal of the tumor — not the whole kidney — if possible.&lt;em&gt;Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>detroitnews.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 04:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizgFBVV95cUxOUFFRX1h3ZFdyLUZiQ3FvNk9INEFBVHIxXzhHdjBROVJ4NG83VzBJWXlQdllIQlVEOFp4MG1qM1htYzA1bDg4bjJPN0xoU3ptSm84dC1LZTNjdURBTmJtYVZEZ1ozX1ZPeHRHX041VVUxSXFPYS1rT3VwTmdCU3ZCVUpxTEpLcHdLaWJxUVdjeFdkbjVPc1ZqVE1Uc28xbmJOLTZFRVhQMXJNa0o4aFpQNTBTYkU4V1FNa0M3ZDlGTkFkZk8wM1Zmb1lyd2RJZw</guid></item><item><title>肯尼迪在西非婴儿中测试疫苗的计划被阻止-西雅图时报</title><link>https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/kennedy-plan-to-test-a-vaccine-in-west-african-babies-is-blocked/</link><description>&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxONERhZHFEN1NHZm1NdnBxaWFmQWJNWDFlRWtyYmRQc2NSSWRqbkdWZjV0MDBlZlNDb0tnQkt5c1Z0Mzg3N1YyemY1UFduR0prd3VNUC1VeUk1ZVM5blk4MFVBZUY1QVhZcV9BTThXOUxBZV9qTnE4SFhYRC1mcklTUUhnWmV0TGVQX1d5djZPWVllcVFhN1czMXhFbE5zT2tEZWpTd25US0dGUzg?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Kennedy plan to test a vaccine in West African babies is blocked&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxPS0hYUUYyZkpwNEpYMHlrVzJPVnMyTW9oa0tRZFpUdHVadi1PQnRGWFlzVS1TWUhKWmR1ZDRxOGpyZ0lTQUNoZTlIZzlkUnpHX21TZmJza1ZFYW9QUGQyaGdBYmN5aHhsbjFFWlBlT1B2V1FUMU93Z1FFTTVzemV3ajhpYk5Pdw?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;RFK Jr. Plan to Test a Vaccine in West African Babies Is Blocked&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxOMG9nVGUxeFJZYjM5eHpxV2ZBN3lnZW1WN3lvRVl5OU5YS2RiOU1uNFhCR0RKZ3V6akgxcXJPWE96dk15TDdFTmg5alRQQW54WS01Mjh4a0JHWGhiaFc4d0RQbUZRakdtZ3hFN0VMN3ZGQzNhaENScjFVOVQtdld2bk1DS2V2czlIM3c?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;A vaccine trial is called 'unethical' and a 'unique' opportunity.

			&lt;p&gt;When someone is affected &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/strokes-are-rising-among-under-55s-do-you-know-what-to-look-for"&gt;by a stroke&lt;/a&gt;, the standard treatment to restore blood flow to the brain can both save their life and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"&gt;cause additional damage&lt;/a&gt; – damage which a new, injectable nanomaterial promises to protect against.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regenerative material, called IKVAV-PA for short, was developed by researchers at Northwestern University in the US. It's previously been shown to repair tissue &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abh3602"&gt;in a mouse model of spinal cord injuries&lt;/a&gt;, and here it was tested on a mouse model of acute ischemic stroke, the &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org/en/about-stroke/types-of-stroke/ischemic-stroke-clots"&gt;most common type&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the core of the treatment are supramolecular therapeutic peptides (STPs), nicknamed 'dancing molecules' because of how dynamically their biological parts can move. This makes them more adaptable and versatile when interacting with target cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-study-links-99-of-heart-attacks-and-strokes-with-4-risk-factors"&gt;Huge Study Links 99% of Heart Attacks And Strokes With 4 Risk Factors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key innovation here was the use of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_administration"&gt;systemic delivery&lt;/a&gt;: injecting the molecules into the bloodstream. It's fast and simple to administer, and far less invasive than delivering them directly to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This systemic delivery mechanism and the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier is a significant advance that could also be useful in treating traumatic brain injuries and neurodegenerative diseases such as a&lt;span&gt;myotrophic lateral sclerosis&lt;/span&gt;," &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2026/01/post-stroke-injection-protects-the-brain-in-preclinical-study"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; materials scientist Samuel Stupp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_189632" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189632" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/StrokeEffects.jpg" alt="Mouse brain scans" class="wp-image-189632 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/StrokeEffects.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/StrokeEffects-600x232.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-189632" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Brains in the treated mice (bottom row) showed fewer signs of brain tissue damage (the lighter-shaded regions). (Gao et al., &lt;em&gt;Neurotherapeutics&lt;/em&gt;, 2026)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the tests on mice, the first success was getting the drug into the brain through the bloodstream. What's more, side effects and broader disruption appeared to be minimal, suggesting the therapy had indeed hit the target of the stroke site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to untreated mice, those given the injected biomaterial after the restoration of blood flow to the brain showed less damage to brain tissue, fewer signs of inflammation, and fewer signs of harmful immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main job of &lt;span&gt;IKVAV-PA&lt;/span&gt; is to encourage nerve cells to repair themselves after injury, whilst also keeping inflammation to a minimum. That inflammation is a real risk as the body continues to react to the initial blood flow blockage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You get an accumulation of harmful molecules once the blockage occurs and then suddenly you remove the clot and all those 'bad actors' get released into the bloodstream, where they cause additional damage," &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2026/01/post-stroke-injection-protects-the-brain-in-preclinical-study"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Stupp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But the dancing molecules carry with them some anti-inflammatory activity to counteract these effects and at the same time help repair neural networks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating patients post-stroke is an incredibly delicate balancing act. After clots block blood flow to the brain to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-blood-type-affects-your-risk-of-early-stroke-study-reveals"&gt;cause the stroke&lt;/a&gt;, restoring that flow is crucial, but collateral damage and even long-term disability can follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" class="alignnone wp-image-189354 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With further development, we could be looking at a secondary treatment that can be applied alongside the restoration of blood flow (known as reperfusion). Of course, this also needs to be tested in humans, and over a much longer time period to assess its long-term safety and viability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tens of millions of people are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/17474930241308142"&gt;affected by strokes&lt;/a&gt; each year, and while the survival rate is &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/stroke/stroke-prognosis"&gt;relatively high&lt;/a&gt;, we're still looking at several million deaths each year and many more lives affected by disability. IKVAV-PA could help make a difference to those figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It has not only a significant personal and emotional burden on patients, but also a financial burden on families and communities," &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2026/01/post-stroke-injection-protects-the-brain-in-preclinical-study"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Ayush Batra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Reducing this level of disability with a therapy that could potentially help in restoring function and minimizing injury would really have a powerful long-term impact."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurot.2025.e00820"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurotherapeutics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
