'But for the first time, I’m kind of stepping outside of my comfort zone and letting go of my past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘So it is a really big deal for me.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The decision follows a years-long, harrowing ordeal that saw Maya lose not only her mother but, for a time, her freedom – all while suffering from a rare condition that debilitates her to this day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, the eloquent and soft-spoken teenager is taking more control over her life – and her healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;An agonizing condition that baffled doctors  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At nine years old, Maya started suffering mystery symptoms such as lesions, asthma attacks and lower-limb muscle contractions. She was in constant pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specialist Dr. Anthony Kirkpatrick diagnosed the young girl in 2015 with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), an extremely rare neurological condition that causes acute sensitivity to even the slightest touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Kirkpatrick recommended ketamine infusion treatments for the pain - they noticeably helped. He also suggested a more intense procedure involving an induced coma that - after days of research - the family decided to travel to Mexico to try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She showed signs of improvement, but severe abdominal pain in 2016 sent Maya to the ER at Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital (JHACH) in St. Petersburg, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Beata requested ketamine as treatment for Maya, doctors refused to administer the drug. And when she further explained that it was recommended by a doctor and the only remedy they'd found, then demanded it for her daughter, Maya was taken from her parents' custody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Beata was then accused of having &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9834-factitious-disorder-imposed-on-another-fdia"&gt;Munchausen syndrome by proxy&lt;/a&gt; (MSbP) - a mental health condition where the affected falsely acts like someone within their care is sick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maya is leaving behind her home state altogether, along with the painful memories it holds of her mother’s death and her own medical kidnapping&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maya was just 10 years old when she went to hospital with a debilitating pain. Doctors accused her mother of abuse and Maya didn't see her for 87 days &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The story of Maya's medical kidnapping and the agonizing journey that drove her mother Beata (second from right) to death is the focus of the harrowing Netflix documentary 'Take Care of Maya'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She underwent a court-ordered psychological evaluation which determined she did not have MSbP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, Maya remained in the custody of the state and, for months, was allowed only minimal contact with her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While confined to her hospital bed in December 2016, Maya wrote a letter to the judge overseeing her case, outlining in excruciating detail how she was in more pain and begging him to let her see her family over Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maya's lawyer also asked the court if there was 'any way' she could simply see her mother to give her a hug, but the judge refused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She only saw her mother once over the 87 days – when Maya appeared in court in January 2017 for a dependency hearing, where a judge would consider if she could return to her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maya was in a wheelchair, and her family and legal team said she was looking 'worse' than ever, despite almost three months in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Beata died by suicide 48 hours later, believing that removing herself as a perceived obstacle was the only way to get her daughter better care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family sued JHACH, accusing the hospital of medical malpractice, false imprisonment and intentional infliction of emotional distress among other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were stunned when they found staff had billed their insurance for 174 CRPS treatments - a remedy for the condition they’d accused her mother of manufacturing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Five months after Take Care of Maya’s streaming premiere, a Florida jury found the hospital had falsely imprisoned Maya and contributed to her mother's death - the Kowalskis were awarded $261 million in damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The amount was later reduced to $213.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A judge struck down the hospital’s demand for a retrial. JHACH is appealing the decision, insisting they were not responsible for Beata's death because she wasn't in their care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maya started learning the piano at three years old with her mother's support. A natural performer, she is now hoping to put her ordeal behind her by moving to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Trying to put her traumatic childhood behind her  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maya tries not to dwell on the experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We have a limited time on this Earth,' she says profoundly, 'and why would I want to spend even a fraction of that thinking about the worst things that have happened to me?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, she looks to the future, focuses on spirituality and meditates overlooking the lake and private dock behind the Florida home she has been sharing with her father and younger brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to concentrating on mental health, Maya does physical therapy exercises in her family’s pool. But her pain has still not completely gone away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I have my moments where it is worse, and I always get really scared,' she tells the Daily Mail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My biggest fear is being as sick as I used to be, but I am starting to do the things I know work for my pain management and promising myself that I’m going to take care of my physical being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I feel like the work has paid off. I’m walking.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, she has limitations. She tried figure skating again – something she’d enjoyed doing with her mother – but ‘noticed the pain was getting a little bit uncontrollable’ and stopped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nowadays, Maya says, she’ll feel pain in her leg and lower back and ‘randomly’ in her left wrist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A few months before her 19th birthday, she moved with her father and brother to Odessa, 95 miles north of the home she grew up in, to mark a new beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maya still has ‘beautiful memories’ from her old house, but couldn’t escape the fact that it was where her mother died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s like every day I was reminded that she had killed herself,’ she says. ‘It was time for a change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Also, people in the community started to notice us for our traumatic history,' she recalled, adding that she has 'a hard time' when people she doesn't know have preconceived notions about her based off 'the worst part of my life.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In addition to concentrating on mental health, Maya does physical therapy exercises in her family’s pool. But her pain has still not completely gone away&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Healing through pursuing her passion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Immediately after the move farther north, Maya didn’t know what to do with herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She’d earlier been accepted into the University of Miami and planned to study business marketing, but also considered becoming a homicide detective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ultimately, she decided to forego the classroom completely for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I think I would be a lot more stable just starting my life as an adult, as opposed to going to school and then worrying about what people think of me,’ she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘From an emotional maturity standpoint, I definitely am a few years above average – which I see as a gift now, but it has been hard to cope with,’ she tells the Daily Mail. ‘I feel like an alien most of the time.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She’s also emerging from what she calls ‘one consistent' eight-year-long depressive episode where the trauma kept piling up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was ‘during a depressive episode’ after moving to Odessa that Maya leaned into a talent and passion that’s now sending her life in a new direction: the performing arts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I looked up things in the [Odessa] area, and I found an acting studio,’ she tells the Daily Mail. ‘It was the first time I had genuinely laughed and smiled in a long time.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A natural performer, she wanted to be a pop singer as a child and, with her mother's support, started learning piano at three years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I remember going to her about it, and she took it upon herself to educate herself on the very basics before putting me in class,’ says Maya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Beata would listen to her daughter play while working and ‘found it very relaxing,’ Maya says. There’s a Yamaha baby grand in the pristine white living room of their new home that she likes to play at sunset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She’d been taking vocal coaching twice a week up until recently but hasn’t performed much publicly since her mother’s death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When I sing, I think of her… it’s very emotional for me,’ she says. ‘I always end up crying.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has focused on acting - something she used to love doing in school productions until she got sick - and found it a very effective outlet for channeling her pain and emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I’ve only been acting for four months, and… I have so much room to grow,’ she says. ‘I don’t think I’m that great; I feel that I’m decent… but I know one of the silver linings of everything I’ve been through is that it has added so much life experience – and that life experience, I think, is more beneficial than talent, or what other people call talent, because it’s real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When you’re able to excavate those emotions and apply them to these projects, it’s actually very healing, as well,' she said, adding that it's allowed her to let go of some anger, sadness and hurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She considers this catharsis a 'privilege.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I’m able to have this outlet to kind of project all of it in a healthy way... I’ve gotten to this place where I feel very grounded. I feel very calm,’ Maya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Obviously, I still struggle with sadness and anger and frustration, but the difference is, I have a coping mechanism – and for all people, at the end of the day, you have to learn how to forgive.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maya can now frequently be found filming audition tapes or flying to jobs. Despite her newbie status, she’s already worked on projects that include a YouTube comedy series, a Hallmark movie and a dystopian short film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'One day, I want to be in a feature film,' she says. 'And I just want to feel that I'm making movies that matter.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some collaborators know her history, such as the director who cast her as 'girl who’d lost her mother'. Others have no idea. And when it comes to genre, Maya says she does ‘gravitate towards drama, horror and dark comedy.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The acting community has also introduced her to a new circle of ‘soul friends’ she would never have expected getting close to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I actually feel like they are my best friends,’ she says. ‘It’s hard to find people here (in Florida) that I could connect with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Beata took her own life in the garage of the family home in Florida after only seeing Maya once in 87 days  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And these people have gone through a range of things as well. So I think, the collective of their experiences and mine - we just have a different type of bond.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;The unbreakable bond with her father and brother  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her strongest bond, though, seems to still be with her brother, Kyle, who’s now 17 and keeping out of sight in Odessa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I think the trials of our life have bonded us together, and even though we’ve experienced them from very different angles, we still have that underlying understanding of pain,’ she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kyle and Jack&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; accompanied Maya to California in February to help find a place for her to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The trip coincided with Beata’s birthday - she would have turned 52 this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The trio celebrates the day together every year, whether it be with dinner, a cake or Beata’s favorite, gelato - this time, they found somewhere in LA where they could enjoy it in her memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the immediate aftermath of her mother’s death, Maya says, ‘we talked about her a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And then I think when the trial happened, we all got very quiet – because long days, emotionally taxing days, and then we all had to decompress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Now we still talk about her, and we’ll share memories, but it’s always in a really positive light.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Keeping her mother's memory alive  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family will recall expressions and words Beata would use, fondly remembering things she loved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are echoes of their matriarch throughout the new home – whether it be her rosary, which Maya keeps within easy reach on her bedroom desk, or their dog's middle name. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They brought Chelsea Benya Kowalski - a Yorkie - home in the aftermath of the suicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The middle name ‘doesn’t make sense to a lot of people,' Maya explained, 'but it’s a nickname in Polish for Beata.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During moments of doubt and difficulty, it’s her mother’s spirit that Maya tries to channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I obviously wish she was still here,' the teen says. But she remembers her mother as 'so bold and audacious and brave – and no BS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maya holds her mother's rosary at the home she is preparing to leave. She has tried to channel Beata's drive as she takes the bold step to move across the country&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘She was very goal-driven, and… she had this self-respect that I admire so much. I wish I had a little bit more of that.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maya calls her ‘strong, like strongest person I know. And whenever I’m feeling uneasy or self-doubt creeps in, I try to picture my mom and think, “What would she do? She wouldn’t be bothered by this. She would stand her ground and be who she is, regardless of what anyone says."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The young adult hopes to memorialize her mother in other ways, too, through a dream totally separate from but just as important as her acting goals: She wants to do some type of charitable work helping others with chronic illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Once my court is wrapped up and once I’m situated, I would love to start putting in some plans to make this happen.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She believes here mother 'would be on board' fully with those charitable efforts, which 'would be so important to her emotionally' given the trauma that devastated the Kowalskis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maya says she'll 'do my best to live up to that’ passion and devotion so strongly exhibited by her mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maya says she'll 'do my best to live up to that’ passion and devotion so strongly exhibited by her mother, almost a decade after her life was upended &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the teen remains, remarkably, philosophical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Sometimes bad things need to happen for progress to be made,’ she tells the Daily Mail. ‘And I look at my situation, and if I was the person that had to go through all this bad stuff, so be it.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maya says that while she largely doesn't pay attention to social media comments, she sometimes takes a peek. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And when she sees social workers, nurses, doctors or anyone in the medical field leaving positive words, it's gratifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I’ve been told that my documentary is used to educate medical professionals, and I can’t even begin to express how happy that makes me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This really negative thing happened, sure – but the people who need to hear it most… they’re learning from it,' she says.

But we do need to acknowledge that, in a small subset of individuals... there may be a risk of persistent symptoms post-vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These patients shouldn’t be dismissed. Just because something is rare doesn’t mean it’s not real.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Below, the Daily Mail reveals the symptoms research has linked to vaccines and what to do if you experience them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The previously-unknown condition, dubbed 'post-vaccination syndrome' (PVS), can persist years after taking the mRNA vaccines— made by the likes of Pfizer and Moderna&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A 2024 study looked at the conditions most associated with Covid vaccinations. Heart issues like pericarditis and myocarditis were most often linked to the shots &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Neurological symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Yale researchers reported that PVS is characterized by symptoms such as headaches, dizziness and 'brain fog'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who experience these symptoms may suffer from debilitating head pain, feeling faint, weak or unsteady, confusion, thinking difficulty, problems with concentration and diminishing memory.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This group of symptoms are among the most common and usually develop within 48 hours of receiving a vaccine and become more severe in the following days and weeks, and can persist over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2022 study by UK researchers found the most frequently reported adverse events after receiving the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca in the UK were headaches, cluster headaches, migraines and dizziness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the PVS patients analyzed by the Yale researchers, brain fog was reported in 78 percent of people and difficulty concentrating or focusing was reported by 73 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate 2024 analysis found brain fog was reported in about one in 1,000 doses of an mRNA Covid vaccine - such as Pfizer's - and 56 in 1,000 doses of an adenoviral vector vaccine - such as Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson/Janssen's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while headaches can be common side effects of vaccines, a 2021 study found headaches post Covid vaccine could be a sign of cerebral venous thrombosis - deadly blood clots that form in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Zoe Lees, who studies metabolic medicine, told the Daily Mail that it is 'common' to have headaches or dizziness after a vaccine but they typically resolve in a short timeframe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: These symptoms are more likely to be due to the body's immune response rather than direct damage to nerves. Severe or frequent symptoms are extremely rare'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she added: 'If symptoms [last] more than a few weeks, it is appropriate to seek further evaluation.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For people experiencing headaches or migraines, treatment can include over-the-counter pain medication or prescription drugs, as well as lifestyle and diet changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatments for symptoms like dizziness, confusion and difficulty concentrating can vary widely based on the individual and people typically have to trial and error multiple therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Exercise intolerance &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yale researchers found exercise intolerance was among the most commonly reported symptom of people with PVS — with 80 percent of people suffering from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And a 2023 preprint paper found exercise intolerance was suffered by 71 percent of people reporting PVS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise intolerance is characterized by the inability or struggle to perform physical activity at a person's desired intensity or at the same caliber they exercised at prior to receiving a Covid vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This may manifest as running out of breath sooner than usual or being too tired to start or complete a work out. People may also experience muscle weakness, aches or pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to being linked to PVS, exercise intolerance has also been associated with long Covid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yale researchers discovered that, in people experiencing exercise intolerance, despite the heart and lungs functioning normally, the body isn't able to properly extract and use oxygen from the blood as fuel that would normally allow a person to perform at their highest ability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There aren't many options for treating the condition, but doctors may prescribe high-dose vitamins and a medication used to treat muscle weakness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Fatigue and difficulty sleeping &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 2023 preprint found excessive fatigue was experienced by 69 percent of people reporting PVS and the Yale researchers report 85 percent of people with PVS experienced the symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, 70 percent of PVS patients had trouble falling or staying asleep, according to the Yale researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the 2022 UK study reported poor quality sleep among the most frequently reported side effects after receiving a Covid vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2023 study examining the relationship between sleep and the Covid vaccines found people who experienced vaccine side effects had less and worse sleep than people who experienced no side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thirteen percent of people had moderate to severe insomnia. Nearly four percent had trouble falling asleep; 6.8 percent couldn't stay asleep; and 7.4 percent were consistently waking up too early. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while brain fog is a PVS symptom itself, lack of or poor sleep can contribute to it, making it harder to concentrate and think. It can also lead to mood changes like irritability and depression and cause an increased risk of obesity, heart disease and &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-f383e740-1a27-11f0-8183-9dc3b1229fb2" class=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adequate sleep is crucial for the body to repair itself and for the immune system, helping to strengthen it to fend off viruses. People with PVS who suffer from poor sleep may be at a greater risk for other medical issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To treat sleep problems, doctors may recommend medications, talk therapy, or changes to a person's lifestyle and diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Lees told the Daily Mail fatigue is also one of the most common side effects of getting a vaccine but it should subside within one to two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, if someone is still struggling with the symptom for more than six weeks, 'supportive treatment is offered in post-viral syndrome clinics.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rory Nairn (pictured here), a 26-year-old from New Zealand, died from myocarditis 12 days after receiving his first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine in 2021&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Myocarditis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle (myocardium) that can reduce the heart's ability to pump blood effectively, potentially leading to heart failure, abnormal heartbeat and at times, sudden death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is usually caused by by a viral infection and there are less than 200,000 US cases per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with myocarditis may experience chest pain or tightness, shortness of breath, fatigue and loss of energy, swollen legs and irregular heartbeats.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In rare cases, mRNA shots have been shown to cause myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis, inflammation of the sac-like lining surrounding the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The side effect is rare but exactly how rare is still being debated. A major 2021 study in Israel put the rate at one in 50,000. Other studies have come to vastly different estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jared Ross, an emergency medicine physician and medical school professor, told the Daily Mail post-vaccine myocarditis is more common in males than females, especially under the age of 30. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said the condition typically develops after a viral infection, but can be triggered by a vaccine - most commonly the Moderna Covid vaccine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CDC data shows post-vaccine myocarditis and pericarditis - inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart - are established side effects of Covid vaccination, though the agency does not provide a number of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the conditions, it's thought the immune system may register mRNA in Covid vaccines as a threat, leading it to attack itself and cause inflammation of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both conditions have also been linked to Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in January 2025, Canadian experts began calling for more &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14329779/covid-vaccine-research-heart-effects-new-study.html"&gt;research into heart damage linked to Covid vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They noted that the scale of the issue remains 'under-documented' due to the studies being too narrow and haven't looked at the risk of these injuries months and years after receiving the shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers from British Columbia also warn that these studies have been inconsistent in how they classify 'postvaccine' myocarditis and pericarditis, using different timeframes to define if the conditions were directly linked to the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment for myocarditis includes medications, lifestyle adjustments, rest, surgery or a heart transplant in severe cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dr Ross said: 'Thankfully, most patients fully recover.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tinnitus is a hearing problem that most commonly takes the form of persistent ringing in the ears&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Tinnitus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tinnitus is a hearing problem that most commonly takes the form of persistent ringing in the ears. It can also sound like buzzing, roaring, hissing, or clicking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Aside from being a nuisance and disruptive, tinnitus can cause frequent awakenings during the night, as the perceived sound becomes more noticeable in the quiet of the bedroom - disrupting the normal sleep cycle and causing insomnia and sleep deprivation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When such sounds last more than six months, it's known as chronic tinnitus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2024 study published in Frontiers in Pharmacology that analyzed a survey of 398 cases of Covid vaccination-related tinnitus found it occurred in 47 cases per million complete vaccinations with Pfizer's Covid shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were also 51 cases of tinnitus per million complete vaccinations with Moderna's shot and 70 cases per million complete vaccinations with J&amp;amp;J/Janssen's shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Hamid Djalilian, chief medical advisor for NeuroMed Tinnitus Clinic, told the Daily Mail the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) has about 12,000 reports of tinnitus following a Covid vaccination, 'but compared to the millions of vaccines given, the overall rate is low.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A team at Stanford Medicine Molecular Neurotology Laboratory is studying to find the underlying cause of tinnitus and identify people at risk of developing it after getting a vaccine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Konstantina Stankovic, an otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeon who is leading the research, told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/covid-vaccine-side-effects-tinnitus-may-linked-inflammation-rcna80675"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;: 'We think that many forms of tinnitus reflect some damage in the inner ear and then the brain tries to compensate for the damage and starts to make sound of its own.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research is ongoing and findings have not been published yet.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To treat tinnitus, doctors typically prescribe steroids and one case study also saw doctors treat a patient with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment, which is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that uses magnetic pulses to adjust brain activity that may be causing the ear ringing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Djalilian said 'the best thing is to start supportive care' if you develop the condition following a vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He continued: 'This includes antioxidants, hydration, and rest. Staying calm is important, as anxiety and stress only makes things worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kari Ponce de Leon, a 43-year-old mother-of-two from Montana, told the Daily Mail doctors diagnosed her with a series of blood conditions that caused her immune system to block platelets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Blood clots and low platelets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The co-occurrence of blood clots and low platelet counts following a Covid vaccination is a condition called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is a rare but serious condition that has been linked to the J&amp;amp;J/Janssen Covid vaccine, the CDC reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It involves the formation of blood clots (thrombosis) together with a decrease in platelet count (thrombocytopenia).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blood clots can travel throughout the body and lead to deadly complications like strokes, while platelets are essential for blood to clot and for wounds to heal, so having too few could lead to uncontrolled, deadly bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms include severe headaches, blurry vision, difficulty speaking, easy bruising, leg pain or swelling, excessive bleeding and abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A CDC report from August 2021 stated there had been 38 cases of TTS within 15 days of Covid vaccinations and four patients had died as of July 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, the overall TTS rate was three cases per 1million doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In early 2021, the FDA and CDC recommended pausing the use of the J&amp;amp;J/Janssen vaccine over concerns of its connection to TTS - with six cases having been reported up until that point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In April 2021, however, it lifted the pause after a safety review and the agencies stated the benefits outweighed potential risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More recent data on TTS after Covid vaccination is limited. One 2022 study found the rate was five cases per 130,000 people based on data from Norway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, researchers wrote, suggests an incidence of one case of TTS in 26,000 vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The precise mechanism by which Covid vaccines cause TTS is not known, but it is believed to be set off by some sort of immune response.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment for TTS includes anti-clotting medications and an infusion of blood that contains certain antibodies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kari Ponce de Leon, a 43-year-old mother-of-two from Montana, told the Daily Mail doctors diagnosed her with a series of blood conditions that caused her immune system to block platelets- similar to what happens with TTS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And one doctor wrote in a letter that her condition was likely caused by the Covid vaccine 'because he couldn't find any other reason.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A 2022 study led by academics at Imperial College London suggests almost 20million lives were saved by Covid vaccines in the first year since countries began rolling out the jabs, the majority in wealthy nations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Numbness or burning sensations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 2022 UK study found one of the most frequently reported adverse events after receiving the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was paresthesia - tingling, numbness, prickling or burning sensations throughout the body.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the 2023 preprint found 63 percent of people with PVS reported experiencing numbness and 63 also reported neuropathy - or nerve damage that causes pain, numbness, tingling or weakness most commonly in the arms, legs and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Numbness and burning sensations were also among the most common ailments suffered by PVS patients analyzed by the Yale researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eighty percent of people reported tingling and numbness and 58 percent reported burning sensations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment for these symptoms can include over-the-counter pain medications, anti-inflammatory creams, anti-anxiety and anti-convulsant medications used off-label, physical and occupational therapy and lifestyle and diet changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Guillain-Barré syndrome&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ross explained to the Daily Mail that Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a neurological disorder in which the body's immune system attacks and damages nerves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It causes muscle weakness, numbness, and paralysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said GBS is caused by antibodies that attack the nervous system and it typically occurs after a viral infection or a vaccine - such as the one for Covid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms include unsteady walking, trouble with facial movements and speaking and tingling and weakness most often in the feet, legs, arms and upper body. While most patients recover, severe cases can result in paralysis or death.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, recent studies have found evidence suggesting an increased risk of GBS among adults aged 18 and older due to the Covid vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the August 2021 CDC report, the agency said that after 12.6million doses of the &lt;span&gt;J&amp;amp;J/Janssen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; vaccine, there had been &lt;/span&gt;100 reports of GBS &lt;span&gt;between February and June of that year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the time, the rate of GBS was roughly eight cases per million &lt;span&gt;J&amp;amp;J/Janssen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; vaccine doses. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate study from 2023 published in The Cureus Journal of Medical Science found that Covid shots like the &lt;span&gt;J&amp;amp;J/Janssen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; vaccine - which is a type of vector vaccine - &lt;/span&gt;could make a person over twice as likely to develop GBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vector vaccines use a harmless virus to deliver genetic material into the body to trigger an immune response against the targeted disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers conducted a review of 70 studies on post-vaccination GBS and found 80 percent of the patients developed GBS within 21 days following the first dose of a vector vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Lees told this website that one meta-analysis estimated the overall incidence of GBS to be four per 1million doses of an adenovirus vector vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dr Lees, who is a medical writer at ZipHealth, said a Covid-19 infection itself is associated with an increased risk of developing GBS - 'higher than any potential risk associated with vaccination.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While scientists are yet to determine how the vaccine can trigger GBS, they noted that most of the affected patients were successfully treated and only one death was reported due to autonomic dysfunction - a condition where involuntary body functions such as heart rate, blood pressure and digestion do not function properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no direct cure for GBS and therapy concentrates on alleviating symptoms and preventing complications through blood transfusions, respiratory support and physical therapy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 04:09:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQNjlFM0N2OXN1bWdWakc4VGFXTjVZb0lYUWlkRWxObWQ4TUwwZkVQU1IwVWROR05VX3MtTXVLZmgyV3NyQkNzYUFGdGxuMFZpeUlGdEhoeHc1aklYSFMtNXB4VGhvUG5GVzRXVlk1SkRQSHVWdEw3M2lEX20xbXRwYnBXc1pHTnZaU1FEZ1BOaWM4NVdMdlduc1FLZw</guid></item><item><title>男性健康：为什么男性更少去全科医生？ - BBC | Men's health: Why do men go to the GP less? - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE0wdVA4OS1xWFI3Nkk4bDdmVjZkVmVxc0dEdWJGVHNfcUFaVXNUdG9jQVpabkRQanhKS3pMR2c4SzRqVE9aX0FLRGJfd3UxNWFDb1ZxcVRuQVc1Z9IBX0FVX3lxTE5LbGc2dHJJdmlKN1lPNVp0OXhLNEZDVkV1ZzBXcHFYQ0k2TWwwMUJVOTY3dHpxNDNzbjU0UkJuQk9aQzB6YmhJakhZSE1ZUUwweGxyY0swczJfYTZkVjJj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-737179d2-0 dAzQyd"&gt;These men put off doctor's visits again and again.

But according to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthcaresystem/datasets/experiencesofnhshealthcareservicesinengland" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;ONS Health Insight Survey&lt;/a&gt; from February, commissioned by NHS England, 45.8% of women compared to just 33.5% of men had attempted to make contact with their GP practice for themselves or someone else in their household in the last 28 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Men were more likely to say they weren't registered at a dental practice and "rarely or never" used a pharmacy, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They also make up &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/hospital-outpatient-activity/2023-24" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;considerably fewer hospital outpatient appointments&lt;/a&gt; than women, even when pregnancy-related appointments are discounted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Men are "less likely to attend routine appointments and more likely to delay help-seeking until symptoms interfere with daily function," says Paul Galdas, professor of men's health at the University of York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This all &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clywrl5460jo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;affects men's health outcomes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Experts say there's a long list of reasons why men might put off seeking medical help, and new survey data from the NHS suggests that concerns about how they are perceived come into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In the survey, 48% of male respondents agreed they felt a degree of pressure to "tough it out" when it came to potential health issues, while a third agreed they felt talking about potential health concerns might make others see them as weak. The poll heard from almost 1,000 men in England in November and December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Society associates masculinity with traits like self-reliance, independence and not showing vulnerability, says social psychologist Prof Brendan Gough of Leeds Beckett University. "Men are traditionally supposed to sort things out themselves".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It's worrying to see just how many men still feel unable to talk about their health concerns," says Dr Claire Fuller, NHS medical director for primary care. She notes that men can be reluctant to seek medical support for mental health and for changes in their bodies that could be signs of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"GPs are often the best way to access the help they need," she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-737179d2-0 erjHHi"&gt;'Men are inherent problem-solvers'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Kevin McMullan says he's learned from working for men's mental health charity ManHealth that men want to solve their own problems. He says he struggled with his mental health for years before he finally got help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"You want to fix it yourself. Men are inherent problem-solvers and how you are feeling is a problem in the same way that having a flat tyre is a problem," says Kevin, 44, from Sedgefield in County Durham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This is something that the Health Insights Survey indicates, too. The data suggests that when people were unable to contact their GP practice, men were significantly more likely than women to report "self-managing" their condition, while women were more likely than men to go to a pharmacy or call 111.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Many men feel that help-seeking threatens their sense of independence or competence," Prof Galdas says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250409-091508-0ef9b7676-web-2.19.1-12/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7bda/live/f2655970-1cfc-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7bda/live/f2655970-1cfc-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7bda/live/f2655970-1cfc-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7bda/live/f2655970-1cfc-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7bda/live/f2655970-1cfc-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7bda/live/f2655970-1cfc-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7bda/live/f2655970-1cfc-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7bda/live/f2655970-1cfc-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Kevin McMullan A man in a black t-shirt in front of a plain background smiles at the camera" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Kevin McMullan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Kevin McMullan says many men try solve their own mental health problems&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof Galdas points to other factors deterring men from going to the doctors, like appointment systems that don't fit around their working patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Services also rely on talking openly about problems, he suggests, which doesn't reflect how men speak about health concerns - and there are no fixed check-ups targeting younger men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Women, in contrast, are "sort of forced to engage in the health system" because they might seek appointments related to menstruation, contraception, cervical screenings or pregnancy, says Seb Pillon, a GP in Bolton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;And they're largely in control of organising their family's healthcare, too. For example, roughly 90% of the people who contacted the children's sleep charity Sleep Action for help in the last six months were mums, grandmothers and other women in the children's lives, its head of service Alyson O'Brien says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Because women are more integrated in the healthcare system - through seeking support for both themselves and their children - they're more health-literate and are often the driving force behind their partners seeking medical help, according to Prof Galdas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;And men just have a different attitude towards healthcare, Dr Pillon says. He believes many see it solely as treatment - solving their problems - rather than preventative.

And while the exact &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; is currently under investigation, there is one interesting finding related to your blood levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We're finding that people diagnosed with colon cancer have &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/vitamin-d-deficiency" target="_blank"&gt;low vitamin D levels&lt;/a&gt;,” says vice president of in-office care at One Medical &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.hlth.com/2023event/speakers/natasha-bhuyan-md" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.hlth.com/2023event/speakers/natasha-bhuyan-md"}' href="https://www.hlth.com/2023event/speakers/natasha-bhuyan-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Natasha Bhuyan&lt;/a&gt;, MD. And while the correlation is still a bit chicken-or-the-egg (“this discovery is in the really, really early stages,” Bhuyan adds), there's something else to note: results from a couple of studies &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9537583/" target="_blank"&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4229786/" target="_blank"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, which reveal a “deficiency of vitamin D increases the incidence of colon cancer and also has a negative impact on the survival of colon cancer patients,” it might be time to ask to have your levels looked at the next time you're at the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a blood test will officially reveal if you're deficient. But with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4018438/" target="_blank"&gt;research showing&lt;/a&gt; that almost a billion people on the planet are deficient in vitamin D, it's worth asking your doctor for a test next time you're getting a physical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/vitamin-d-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; plays an important role in both our physical and mental health, helping build strong bones, keep the immune system strong, and balance mental health. Bhuyan advises that there are actually a variety of ways to keep your vitamin D levels healthy. “Some people will eat &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/meals-rich-in-vitamin-d-and-magnesium" target="_blank"&gt;a vitamin-D-rich diet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/how-to-get-vitamin-d" target="_blank"&gt;fortified foods&lt;/a&gt;,” she says. “There's also the option of taking a &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/vitamin-d-benefits-winter" target="_blank"&gt;vitamin D supplement&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/serotonin-vitamin-d-sun" target="_blank"&gt;spending time in the sun&lt;/a&gt; because that helps your body make it naturally. But we always advise you to be really cautious about spending time in the sun, because it can also increase your risk of skin cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while the new diagnosis statistics are startling (“diagnoses of people under 55 years of age doubled from 11% (1 in 10) in 1995 to 20% (1 in 5) in 2019,” reads a press release from the &lt;a href="https://pressroom.cancer.org/CRCFactsFigures2023" target="_blank"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;) for Gen Z, Millennials, and Generation X, knowledge can truly be power in this instance. And maybe eating more vitamin D can be, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 23:31:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE5RX1hKM2tOMmhsUHdqV3haTEw0X0RENUFoc3kyN1BzblJnbWt1Q1dna0lBRVlSZzJmdEVMVUVoOHFKVWdoRmdnSG40cXYxOVBHQjJhbU9zWXBJdkw1TkM0TktjMTZyWjZsSnh5cQ</guid></item><item><title>“运动型”女性在腰痛被误诊为坐骨神经痛后死亡-独立报 | ‘Athletic’ woman dies after lower back pain was misdiagnosed as sciatica - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixwFBVV95cUxOazhCc0xBUU9ibFJXcXRQNmZ6bmRiVnJycHRmTTh4WDY3RDAza2dUenJVaHpJUWttWElRZWJFeVBFY0dSMkFvT3l6cXR4SWw0bUN5YUVabkF1d0V5Z0JWZGotV053NjhwX2FVUnM5OUh4eDZmVkNYVnVzRGllMHZOR0JCWU1XUno1NTBBUnh3ZXlpbU5QbVVXX3l6ZFNzdkFKNmprclN3TlVyX2ZHZENhVWlFOFFTeFM1U2VwMERFQVdHSkZJaGlN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 eWQiqu sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 cGmNxG"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 iqSitv"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 dlmCG"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 igdyzJ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cPkZJS"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 fGzMFb sc-hez36s-16 fJelbS"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 fiXggt"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 eSVQSf"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 cDGSNR"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 kxbAkl"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 kGYWZt"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

pandemic, and she thought this was due to poor posture or a slightly uncomfortable working set-up,” Kelly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By January 2021, the pain was more persistent and she had some new pain radiating into her hip as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="6" class="sc-482ou5-0 jjunLz"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/04/20/8/59/PA-Real-Life-Sarcoma-3.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/04/20/8/59/PA-Real-Life-Sarcoma-3.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;crop=3%3A2%2Csmart&amp;amp;trim=291%2C0%2C349%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/04/20/8/59/PA-Real-Life-Sarcoma-3.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;crop=3%3A2%2Csmart&amp;amp;trim=291%2C0%2C349%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Kate was given emergency radiotherapy and started chemotherapy treatment" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-20007"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;Kate was given emergency radiotherapy and started chemotherapy treatment&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to be a pet parent to know that dogs and cats are like night and day. The history of dogs, at least in their current form, traces back around 15,000 years. According to current scientific consensus, toward the end of the Last Ice Age, more submissive individuals within the gray wolf population began adapting to human interaction in ways they hadn’t before. Many of the friendly traits these proto-dogs developed are still with us, only now, they’re genetically wired to &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scotttravers/2024/03/29/dogs-understand-our-words-more-than-they-let-on-science-reveals/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/scotttravers/2024/03/29/dogs-understand-our-words-more-than-they-let-on-science-reveals/" target="_self" aria-label="read and respond to us"&gt;read and respond to us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike dogs, cats appear to have “domesticated themselves,” choosing to live alongside humans while maintaining their independence, a process that began 9,000 years ago. That might sound on-brand for cat meme material, but the science backs it up. Housecat DNA remains largely unchanged from their wild ancestors, and history has shown that these furballs are never too far from &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scotttravers/2024/07/14/a-house-cat-was-brought-to-a-remote-island-in-1894-a-year-later-a-species-was-extinct/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/scotttravers/2024/07/14/a-house-cat-was-brought-to-a-remote-island-in-1894-a-year-later-a-species-was-extinct/" target="_self" aria-label="flipping back into elite predator mode when the right opportunity strikes"&gt;flipping back into elite predator mode when the right opportunity strikes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this context makes the story of France’s 1960s feline space mission even heavier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In The ’60s, Cats Were ‘Chosen’ From The Streets Of Paris For A Secret Space Mission&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1947, the United States made &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scotttravers/2025/04/19/3-animals-you-didnt-know-went-to-space---one-might-still-be-out-there-waiting-to-wake-up/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/scotttravers/2025/04/19/3-animals-you-didnt-know-went-to-space---one-might-still-be-out-there-waiting-to-wake-up/" target="_self" aria-label="space history with a swarm of fruit flies"&gt;space history with a swarm of fruit flies&lt;/a&gt;. Launched aboard a captured German rocket, these unusual passengers were sent to study the effects of cosmic radiation on living organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Cold War escalated, space became the stage for geopolitical flexing. The U.S. and the U.S.S.R were aiming for more than just technological milestones. It was a brazen display of ideological one-upmanship. In 1957, the Soviets launched Laika into space, and by the early ’60s, animals had become central to space programs around the world, their lives traded for data in the race beyond Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the backdrop in which France — late to the party but eager to join the club — made a curious choice. While the Soviets sent dogs and the Americans trained primates, France turned to stray cats, plucked from the streets of Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourteen female cats were brought in by scientists at CERMA, France’s space medicine program. None of them were named. In fact, in a small attempt to keep things clinical, they were deliberately given ID numbers instead of names. It was treated as pre-launch protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cats were wired up with electrodes to monitor brain activity and put through a bootcamp of sorts. They were confined in tight containers for long periods, just to observe their reactions. Then came the centrifuge — designed to simulate the crushing G-forces of launch and re-entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For animals that had once stalked alleyways and rooftops, it was an abrupt shift in lifestyle. Eventually, six cats made it to the final round. One of them, a black-and-white tuxedo with the designation C341, stood out. Not because she was stronger, faster or more willing, but because she was the one who got chosen.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An unnamed stray, strapped into a capsule, headed for a once-in-a-lifetime journey past the Kármán line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;C341’s Launch Day In The Algerian Sahara, October 18, 1963&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A slender Veronique AGI rocket stood poised at the Interarmy Special Vehicles Test Centre in the Algerian Sahara. There was no towering launch tower. Instead, there were four long legs holding it upright. Inside the capsule sat C341 — still unnamed, still wired up and still unaware she was a participant in a geopolitical power struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rocket lifted off just after 8 a.m. and carried her beyond the bureaucratic boundary of space, the Kármán line. She hit &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-missions/felicette-first-cat-space" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-missions/felicette-first-cat-space" aria-label="9.5 g on the way up"&gt;9.5 g on the way up&lt;/a&gt;, spent a few minutes in weightlessness, then came back down under 7 g, sealed inside a capsule with no windows and no context. It lasted 13 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She flew 57 kilometers past the accepted edge of space, and minutes later, she landed upside down in the sand. When the press got hold of the story and assumed the space cat was male, they called her Félix. The scientists corrected them — Félicette. And with that, C341 finally had a name. However, it would take decades for anyone to remember it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-base embedly-align"&gt;&lt;fbs-embedly iframe-src="https://embedly.forbes.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fv-tpmvGRoyw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dv-tpmvGRoyw&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fv-tpmvGRoyw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube"&gt;&lt;/fbs-embedly&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Autopsy That Taught No One Anything&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Félicette didn’t get a reunion tour or a retirement cushion. Just a few weeks after her return, she was euthanized so scientists at CERMA could study her body. The goal was to see how spaceflight had affected her internal systems. But the results were underwhelming. Whatever they were hoping to find, they didn’t. The postmortem taught them little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, she was cataloged like any other lab subject. One experiment in a series. The only cat ever sent to space, and yet, for years, barely a footnote in history. That would change. But not for a while, and not in the &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scotttravers/2025/01/11/the-tragic-story-of-laika-the-soviet-canine-cosmonaut-who-made-space-history-in-1957/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/scotttravers/2025/01/11/the-tragic-story-of-laika-the-soviet-canine-cosmonaut-who-made-space-history-in-1957/" target="_self" aria-label="same way we remember Laika"&gt;same way we remember Laika&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Félicette Was Remembered Again, But Only Sort Of&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Félicette’s story was rediscovered in an era that had grown more reflective about the costs of our ambitions, particularly on non-consenting, non-human participants. In 2019, a statue was unveiled in her honor at the International Space University in Strasbourg. Cast in bronze, it showed her sitting atop Earth, looking up at the stars she once flew so close to. This gesture was the best we could come up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it’s only human to romanticize her, part of what makes her story so tragic is how unromantic it is. No one claimed she volunteered. She was a street cat who ended up strapped into a rocket. And yet, something about her legacy painfully lingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be because cats, despite all their independence, have evolved to understand us in subtle, unsettling ways. They respond to human emotion. They know how to earn food, how to navigate social cues and how to win affection without losing autonomy. Evolution, it seems, didn’t overwrite their instincts, it just &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1410083111" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1410083111" aria-label="rewired how they manage risk and reward in human environments"&gt;rewired how they manage risk and reward in human environments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that sense, Félicette was the perfect subject: independent enough to survive the streets of Paris, adaptable enough to tolerate confinement and familiar enough for her absence to finally sting — just a few decades too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While Félicette’s story is a slow burn, the cost of human progess has turned into a display of the snowball effect in action.

After all, the sports heroes with whom many of us grew up had expiry dates. Wayne Gretzky slowed down in his thirties, while Olympic superstars Usain Bolt and Michael Phelps peaked in their twenties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;But performances such as Rice’s force us to rethink the limitations we’ve placed on ourselves and others of a certain age. Because it’s not only the exceptions who are redefining what is athletically possible later in life: &lt;a href="https://www.worldmarathonmajors.com/stars" target="_blank"&gt;the average age &lt;/a&gt;of a person finishing the World Marathon Majors is now 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Some recent science has helped bust myths around what people of middle-age and beyond can do safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;“We are still fighting the old message that people need to slow down when they hit a certain age, but there is no core reason to tell someone that they can’t keep training like an athlete,” said Scott Trappe, who studies human performance and aging, and is the director of the Human Performance Laboratory at Ball State University in Indiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="BodyImage__BodyImagePhoto-sc-xeeopr-0 hMFmrT l-align l-align--right"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/TNY3DRNHCFAKVADVXUSRWKN4PU.JPG?auth=048422dec690bcc068dbcea34d6f0bc7580cb5e567923951ed67b1116ab669b8&amp;amp;width=600&amp;amp;height=400&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;smart=true" aria-haspopup="true" data-photo-viewer-index="2"&gt;&lt;span class="u-visually-hidden"&gt;Open this photo in gallery:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-image-figcap c-image-figcap--block"&gt;&lt;div class="figcap-grid"&gt;&lt;div class="figcap-cc"&gt;&lt;p class="figcap-text"&gt;&lt;span class="caption text-gmr-4"&gt;Ed Whitlock, 74, crosses the finish line of the Scotiabank Toronto Waterfront Marathon in just over three hours on Sept. 25, 2005.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit text-gmr-5"&gt;Tibor Kolley/The Globe and Mail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;He explains how excessive caution in research has held back generations of seniors from exercising like athletes. In the 1980s, for example, studies showed that exercise did not lead to physiological adaptations in elderly people as it did in younger ones, suggesting that it may not be worth the trouble. As a result,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;many seniors limited their workouts to walking or &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070104013103/http://www.jazzercise.com/companyinfo.htm"&gt;jazzercise &lt;/a&gt;(look it up).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;But these studies, designed by researchers wary of injuring their participants, were not rigorous enough to generate physiological benefits, Trappe says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Later research uncovered that the body’s response to cardiovascular exercise does not change much with age: &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1540458/#:~:text=In%20conclusion%2C%20exercise%20enhances%20mitochondria,concomitant%20increases%20in%20mitochondria%20biogenesis."&gt;mitochondria still grow and multiply&lt;/a&gt;, capillary networks still &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/exercise-and-your-arteries"&gt;expand&lt;/a&gt; to improve blood flow, and metabolic enzymes still become more active and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4048572/#:~:text=Exercise%20requires%20a%20high%20amount,also%20by%20phosphorylating%20metabolic%20enzymes."&gt;better at converting fuel into energy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;The belief that intense exercise would probably harm healthy elderly people was shown to be a tall tale – one of the same flavour that led early 20th-century scientists to believe that women’s uteruses would &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17632029"&gt;fall out&lt;/a&gt; should they run a full marathon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;“If you keep training, the body continues to respond to exercise in a positive manner deep into life,” said Trappe, who at 58, trains and competes as a triathlete, and does a weekly pool workout with a former colleague, who is 89.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Exercising in old age does come with a long list of potential pitfalls. One of the biggest is expecting the same performance as in earlier years and failing to account for natural physiological decline – such as a less efficient heart and reduced blood volume – which can lead to overtraining or injury. Orthopedic challenges that were not a concern earlier in life, like a bum knee or hip, are also common. And exercising with health conditions like diabetes or cancer brings a whole new list of considerations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;A good way to set oneself up for vigorous exercise later in life is to do it earlier in life, too. &lt;a href="https://www.sleepclinic.be/wp-content/uploads/Long-term-Change-in-Cardiorespiratory-Fitness-and-All-Cause-Mortality.pdf"&gt;Cardiovascular fitness&lt;/a&gt;, or VO2 max, is one of the strongest predictors of all-cause mortality in the world, and strength training two to three times a week can help stave off a number of conditions including osteoporosis, cancer, diabetes, and heart issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;The good news is that we are entering a golden age of fitness across age groups. Multigenerational sports such as pickleball are thriving, while age-group competitions at major events such as marathons and Ironman races are drawing more participants. Advances in gear are also improving performance and making it easier than ever for athletes to train in ways that support recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;And then there is representation: The more we see people older than 30 accomplishing impressive sport feats, the more we come to expect it and may eventually try it for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Yet, all this does not mean that we are sailing toward a future where everyone runs marathons beyond retirement age. Our work lives, which have become more sedentary, make us less fit than they used to, Trappe says. This leads to huge differences in health between those who invest in their fitness early and throughout life, and those who do not. It reminds me of a phrase on a poster at the physiotherapy clinic I frequent in Toronto: It’s easier to maintain fitness than to build it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Trappe agrees. “In our current conditions, vigorous exercise may be the most powerful medicine out there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Globe and Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 19:41:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxOMG15dS15X3M2RXQwMDNCZlh3alYydTlNb0lDM1dRbUF0TldHRldfTnpubEZfN3hIbFdUUUthS3Nod2VNT3B2ekFjSU1rWU5CWUlhbW45cG0xR3o4dHlxZE10cEZPbzB0V1UwMVlCYVN2VWxvaDFsaDFQYlF6R2JGZEx5NnpGTXVIWmJBaHRqQlEzaXM5bTVCd1VvYzhGZ29PTlNGUWNwMmhvb2QwZlpRYlBB</guid></item><item><title>路易斯安那州、密苏里州和弗吉尼亚州报告2025年首例麻疹病例- NBC新闻 | Louisiana, Missouri and Virginia report first measles cases of 2025 - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPc1l0bjhnai1WaGtkX05rRGpXZUVRYmtfOWhCTXdnNnZENkduMEZnWExzaTAxeUJ5M2tHWE5UNHc5c2pMTmpnV1MxNVowaUwtYWJ3WFZpRnVXRko1QUlEREZrRFY3bXRqV2ZLMzBvQVVhMzAyUm5RSWlZMjVXcUFSQUpKUmN4TjJaRTFyU1Uxb1NLcUgzNVNXd2JDTXVVbmpYT0d6b2wya1h4YnPSAVZBVV95cUxNWENwVV9ITEdwdFBkU3pCdFdwdFQ5cVdKOTQ4V3BWUHNhRmN1V0dicnhDMWVkQWVqeUtVWE5rVFduRHVpZ29oZGk0dnZPa1E0VUowMDl5QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Louisiana, Missouri and Virginia have all reported their first measles cases in 2025, and they say all three patients’ cases are linked to international travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The most recently announced case in northwest Virginia is a child in the 0 to 4-year age range who had recently traveled internationally, according to the state’s health department.

			&lt;p&gt;Amid very real worries that tech is eroding our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/even-just-having-your-phone-in-view-reduces-your-brain-power-says-a-new-study"&gt;cognitive skills&lt;/a&gt; – why learn math or facts when you always have a calculator and Google? – a new study suggests that staying tech-savvy later in life can reduce &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/shock-link-found-between-marriage-and-risk-of-developing-dementia"&gt;dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Texas analyzed data from 57 previous studies, covering more than 411,000 people aged over 50, to look at the link between digital tech habits and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/up-to-13-of-dementia-cases-could-be-a-misdiagnosed-treatable-condition"&gt;cases of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You can flip on the news on just about any day and you'll see people talking about how technologies are harming us," &lt;a href="https://news.web.baylor.edu/news/story/2025/digital-dementia-does-technology-use-digital-pioneers-correlate-cognitive-decline"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; psychologist and neuroscientist Michael Scullin, from Baylor University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"People often use the terms 'brain drain' and 'brain rot', and now digital dementia is an emerging phrase. As researchers, we wanted to know if this was true."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_158365" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-158365" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/StudyChart.jpg" alt="Study chart" class="wp-image-158365 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/StudyChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/StudyChart-600x316.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-158365" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers collated data from multiple studies, which all took different approaches. (Benge and Scullin, &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statistical analysis showed that technology use was associated with a 58 percent reduction in the risk of cognitive impairment. Additionally, tech users showed between 26 and 34 percent lower rates of cognitive decline over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that this isn't the type of research that can prove direct cause and effect. Each study used different approaches, and measured technology use in a different way: some studies looked at smartphone use, for example, while others were measuring &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scrolling-through-social-media-has-a-unique-effect-on-your-body"&gt;social media use&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the reduction in risk still held after adjustments for factors including occupation, education, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/poverty-may-accelerate-brain-aging-study-shows"&gt;socioeconomic status&lt;/a&gt;. It seems there is a link here, which is worth investigating in further research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our data suggests encouraging older adults to engage with technology, particularly in a manner that helps challenge, connect, and compensate for cognitive problems, could be a powerful approach to promoting cognitive health," &lt;a href="https://news.utexas.edu/2025/04/14/technology-use-linked-to-better-brain-health-in-older-adults/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuropsychologist Jared Benge, from the University of Texas at Austin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology use could help protect against cognitive decline and dementia in a few different ways, the researchers suggest. It might help to stimulate the brain, for instance, especially when it comes to learning how to use new devices and apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech can also keep us better connected, with social media and video calls. We already know that being lonely &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/loneliness-proteins-in-your-blood-could-be-putting-your-health-at-risk"&gt;is associated with&lt;/a&gt; a higher chance of developing dementia, while maintaining social ties can keep the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-social-life-could-help-you-stave-off-dementia-for-years-study-finds"&gt;brain humming along&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also the idea of technology acting as 'scaffolding' around a drop in mental capabilities, and keeping elderly people more independent for longer – apps helping with reminders for medications and health appointments, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a complex picture, with a lot of factors involved, but given the broad reach of this new study and the large sample size, it could well be worth maintaining &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-6g-wireless-tech-is-500-times-faster-than-average-5g-smartphones"&gt;our relationship with tech&lt;/a&gt; as we get older – and helping others to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you have a parent or grandparent who's just staying away from technology, maybe revisit that," &lt;a href="https://news.web.baylor.edu/news/story/2025/digital-dementia-does-technology-use-digital-pioneers-correlate-cognitive-decline"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Scullin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Could they learn to use photo, messaging, or calendar apps on a smartphone or tablet? Start simple and be very patient while they learn."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-025-02159-9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Blood vessels at the back of your eye may one day alert doctors to signs of early dementia, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-eyesight-could-be-putting-you-at-risk-of-developing-alzheimers"&gt;Multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-vision-can-predict-dementia-12-years-before-diagnosis-study-discovers"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-test-could-tell-if-you-have-early-signs-of-dementia-with-high-accuracy"&gt;have found&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-crucial-link-between-eye-disease-alzheimers"&gt;links&lt;/a&gt; between eye problems and dementia risk. Plaques of amyloid beta proteins, a hallmark of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="158444" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease, &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00921/full"&gt;have even been found&lt;/a&gt; in the retinas of people who have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eye-test-could-predict-cognitive-decline-before-alzheimer-s-takes-hold"&gt;Three years ago&lt;/a&gt;, researchers from the University of Otago in New Zealand discovered that thinning in a person's retina in middle age can be linked to cognitive performance in their early and adult life. That's the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists suspected these findings could &lt;span&gt;one day pave the way towards a simple eye test to help predict a person's risk for conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Now, some members of that team have followed the hunch a step further.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p paraid="643659715" paraeid="{3f1d0684-7ab2-4f3a-b57b-23d27b101470}{135}"&gt;"In our study, we looked at the retina, which is directly connected to the brain," University of Otago psychologist&lt;span&gt; Ashleigh Barrett-Young&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/news/newsroom/eye-health-linked-to-dementia-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p paraid="1791504846" paraeid="{3f1d0684-7ab2-4f3a-b57b-23d27b101470}{141}"&gt;"It's thought that many of the disease processes in Alzheimer's are reflected in the retina, making it a good target as a biomarker to identify people at risk of developing dementia."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Barrett-Young and colleagues returned to the longitudinal database used in their &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2788716"&gt;2022 research&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://dunedinstudy.otago.ac.nz/"&gt;Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study&lt;/a&gt;, which tracked 45 years of health data from New Zealanders born in 1972 and 1973.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their new research, the team only used data collected from 938 participants at age 45, including retinal photographs, eye scans, and a battery of tests that gauge midlife risk of Alzheimer's and related dementias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeating the major part of their 2022 study, they checked for associations between cognitive decline and retinal layer thickness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They took special care over the layer of nerve fibers closest to the jelly-filled vitreous cavity that 'fills out' our rounded eyes, and its neighboring layers of ganglion cells and inner plexiform&lt;span&gt;. The nerve fiber layer is particularly important because it carries visual signals to the brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_158449" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-158449" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/07902loa.jpg" alt="cross-section greyscale microscope image of retinal layers as horizontal stripes, from top to bottom labelled nerve fiber layer, layer of ganglion cells, inner plexiform layer, inner nuclear layer, outer plexiform layer, photoceptor layer (rods and cones) and retinal pigment epithelium. " class="wp-image-158449 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/07902loa.jpg 603w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/07902loa-600x389.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-158449" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The structure of the &lt;a href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/anatomy/fovea"&gt;fovea&lt;/a&gt;, the densely packed part of the retina where vision is sharpest. (&lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/phpbin/medlib/histology/p/07902loa.htm"&gt;Boston University&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also looked for possible associations with retinal microvascular health, ascertained by measuring the diameter of tiny arteries and veins in the retina. These "&lt;span&gt;are believed to reflect the integrity of the overall cardiovascular system of the body (including the cerebrovasculature), which is implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and, in particular, vascular dementias," the team &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2021.6082"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that, at least for the 45-year-old Kiwis involved in the study, retinal microvascular health was a much stronger predictor of dementia risk than the nerve fiber layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While thickness of the nerve fiber layer (though not the g&lt;span&gt;anglion cell–inner plexiform layer) was weakly associated with dementia risk, it was nowhere near as strong as the microvascular link.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found dementia risk scores were usually higher among people with narrower &lt;span&gt;arterioles (tiny vessels that carry blood away from the heart) and wider venules (miniature veins that receive blood from capillaries).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical professionals won't be putting the findings of this study into action just yet, because it's too population-specific and observational. Also, as the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/13872877251321114"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt;, while the dementia risk measures are "&lt;span&gt;highly predictive of the likelihood of dementia decades later", they are by no means a direct measure of actual disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, it seems we're getting closer to a world where a routine eye check could help flag the risk of dementia before it hits, and give you more time to plan treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if a pill meant to help you sleep could also protect your brain from one of the most devastating diseases of our time? A new study suggests that a popular insomnia drug might act as an unexpected Alzheimer’s preventative, offering fresh hope in the long and difficult fight against memory loss and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long believed that poor sleep is linked to higher Alzheimer’s risk. Disrupted sleep often appears years before symptoms like forgetfulness or confusion, and researchers believe that’s no coincidence. Deep, high-quality sleep is when the brain gets a chance to clear out waste, including harmful proteins like amyloid-beta and tau that build up in Alzheimer’s patients.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Washington University in St. Louis have taken that connection one step further. In &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ana.26641" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;a 2023 study&lt;/a&gt;, they found that the sleeping pill suvorexant (commonly prescribed for insomnia) may help reduce the levels of those same proteins, even after just two nights of use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="is-wp-image-block wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?quality=82&amp;amp;strip=all" alt="woman sleeping in bed" class="is-wp-image-block wp-image-5932329" srcset="https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?quality=82 2560w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;amp;quality=82 150w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;amp;quality=82 300w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;amp;quality=82 768w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;amp;quality=82 1024w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;amp;quality=82 1536w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;amp;quality=82 2048w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=178%2C100&amp;amp;quality=82 178w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=190%2C107&amp;amp;quality=82 190w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=260%2C146&amp;amp;quality=82 260w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=360%2C203&amp;amp;quality=82 360w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=380%2C214&amp;amp;quality=82 380w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=389%2C219&amp;amp;quality=82 389w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=510%2C287&amp;amp;quality=82 510w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=520%2C293&amp;amp;quality=82 520w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;amp;quality=82 600w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=720%2C405&amp;amp;quality=82 720w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=778%2C438&amp;amp;quality=82 778w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=1020%2C574&amp;amp;quality=82 1020w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=75%2C42&amp;amp;quality=82 75w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="is-wp-image-block wp-element-caption"&gt;Good sleep is still one of the most effective ways to combat cognitive decline. Image source: Gorodenkoff/Adobe&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the experiment, 38 healthy middle-aged adults were given a dose of suvorexant or a placebo. Those who took the drug saw a 10 to 20 percent drop in amyloid-beta levels in their brain fluid as well as a temporary dip in tau proteins. These results are early but promising and suggest that improving sleep may offer more than just rest; it could act as an unexpected preventative for Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="bgr-newsletter-signup-form newsletter-signup-form black-bg"&gt;	&lt;h4&gt;Tech.

The drop in protein levels was short-lived, and long-term use of sleeping pills can come with side effects like dependence and shallower sleep. Plus, there’s still debate in the scientific community about whether lowering amyloid is the key to stopping Alzheimer’s at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still don’t know &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bgr.com/science/yale-breakthrough-may-uncover-the-root-cause-of-alzheimers/"&gt;the root cause of Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;, which is slowing down any chance of finding a cure. Still, the takeaway is compelling. Better sleep might help defend the brain. And while it’s too soon to recommend sleeping pills as a cure or preventative treatment, the results underscore how crucial sleep is for brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until more research is done, experts suggest focusing on natural sleep strategies like consistent bedtimes, limiting screen time before bed, and treating sleep apnea. At least we can &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bgr.com/science/this-ai-can-tell-if-you-might-develop-alzheimers-just-by-hearing-you-speak/"&gt;count on AI to help diagnose Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; more easily while we continue searching for a cure.&lt;/p&gt;

This concerning symptom prompted an emergency hospital visit, leading to a startling discovery that has fascinated medical professionals. Inside his kidney, doctors found a parasitic worm measuring approximately 30 centimeters in length, actively living within his renal system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unusual case of urinary obstruction reveals shocking parasite&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon arrival at the emergency department, the patient displayed mostly normal vital signs, with the exception of mild tachycardia. Medical staff noted significant kidney swelling during their initial examination. Blood tests indicated a possible infection, leading the medical team to implement immediate treatment protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors inserted a catheter to relieve the patient’s urinary retention and administered &lt;strong&gt;intravenous fluids along with antibiotics&lt;/strong&gt; to address the suspected infection. The patient remained under observation overnight as medical staff monitored his condition closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following morning brought a disturbing revelation. The collection bag attached to the catheter contained blood-tinged urine—and swimming within this fluid was a long, thin parasite. This unexpected discovery explained the patient’s inability to urinate, as the creature had been physically obstructing his urinary tract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parasite measured approximately 30 centimeters in length with a width of 3-4 millimeters. Microbiological examination identified it as a male specimen of &lt;em&gt;Dioctophyma renale&lt;/em&gt;, commonly known as the giant kidney worm—a rare parasitic infection in humans that perfectly matched the patient’s symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Giant kidney worm infection: causes and transmission&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Dioctophyma renale&lt;/em&gt; parasite represents one of the largest worms capable of infecting humans. These formidable parasites can survive up to five years within the kidney of their host, causing progressive damage to renal tissue and function over time. Female specimens can grow even more impressive in size, potentially exceeding one meter in length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When investigating the source of infection, doctors learned that the patient frequently consumed raw fish from a lake near his village. The patient confirmed this dietary habit and made a surprising admission—he had previously observed similar worms in his urine on other occasions, suggesting repeated infections despite the rarity of human cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transmission cycle of &lt;em&gt;Dioctophyma renale&lt;/em&gt; typically involves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eggs released into water through infected animal urine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aquatic organisms like oligochaetes consuming these eggs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fish or amphibians ingesting infected intermediate hosts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humans becoming infected through consumption of undercooked aquatic organisms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of water in India represents a crucial factor in this case. Environmental contamination significantly increases the risk of parasitic infections from consuming raw or undercooked fish from local water bodies, as these environments may harbor various stages of the parasite’s life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Medical management and patient outcomes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment approach for this patient involved both supportive care and monitoring. After the initial parasite was expelled “naturally” through the urinary tract, doctors recommended an extended hospital stay for observation. However, the patient elected to return home against medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In more severe cases of &lt;strong&gt;kidney worm infestation&lt;/strong&gt;, surgical intervention may become necessary. The parasite can cause significant damage to renal tissue, potentially leading to kidney dysfunction or failure if left untreated. When multiple parasites are present or when they’ve embedded deeply into renal structures, surgical extraction offers the most definitive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Symptom&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Potential Indication&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Medical Response&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Inability to urinate&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Physical obstruction of urinary tract&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Catheterization&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Blood in urine&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tissue damage from parasite&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Antibiotics, monitoring&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Kidney swelling&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Inflammatory response to infection&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Anti-inflammatory medication&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Abdominal pain&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Parasite movement or tissue damage&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Pain management, parasite removal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medical literature contains few documented human cases of &lt;em&gt;Dioctophyma renale&lt;/em&gt; infection, making this patient’s experience particularly noteworthy. Most infections occur in wild animals like mink, wolves, and dogs, with humans serving as accidental hosts when consuming contaminated food or water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Preventive measures against parasitic infections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This unusual case highlights the importance of food safety practices, particularly when consuming fish and other aquatic organisms. Prevention strategies should include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thoroughly cooking all fish and seafood before consumption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoiding raw fish dishes from unregulated or questionable sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being cautious about water quality, especially in regions with limited sanitation infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seeking prompt medical attention for unusual urinary symptoms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following regular deworming protocols in high-risk areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While cases of human infection with &lt;strong&gt;giant kidney worms remain exceptionally rare&lt;/strong&gt;, they underscore the potential health risks associated with consuming raw or undercooked fish, particularly from freshwater sources in regions with suboptimal water quality. Understanding transmission patterns and maintaining vigilance regarding food preparation can help prevent such dramatic medical emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patient’s previous encounters with similar parasites suggest that enhanced public health education in vulnerable communities could significantly reduce infection risks. By prioritizing food safety and seeking timely medical care for unusual symptoms, individuals can avoid the painful and potentially dangerous consequences of renal parasitic infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

There are two types: HDL - the 'good' kind - and LDL - the 'bad' kind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;LDL can form plaques that buildup and block arteries, raising the risk of heart disease, heart attack and stroke.

She told DailyMail.com she fought as hard as she could for her four-year-old daughter, scared she would never be able to speak to the little girl again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I was unable to move myself in bed, unable to use the restroom, was tube fed via g-tube and intubated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was a speech-language pathologist unable to communicate verbally... so I had to rely on things like eye gaze and movements, letters on an alphabet board or paper to type on and text to speech app on my phone.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eventually, she required a tracheostomy, which creates an opening in the windpipe to insert a tube to help oxygen reach the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because of this, she also required a passy muir valve (PMV) for communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A PMV is a speaking valve designed to facilitate communication for people with tracheostomies or those on ventilators. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It redirects airflow through the vocal cords, mouth, and nose, enabling speech and improving communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As her condition worsened, experts continued to look for answers, but came up empty. Despite this, Mrs Abraham began intensive 'natural' rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told the website: 'For my recovery, I took the most natural approaches I could find. I did acupuncture, cranial sacral therapy, chiropractic treatments, endermologie [massage with a device that promotes blood circulation], stretch therapy and lasers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I completely avoided any prescription medications to address pain. However, I did do monthly infusions of IVIG [antibodies] per my neurologists recommendation as there was no way possible I would experience any medical complications or side effects from this form of medication.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She also worked with another speech pathologist in the ICU, as well as during rehab to regain her voice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As months went by, she started to &lt;span&gt;slowly relearn how to swallow, speak and move and was eventually sent home - still without a diagnosis - and was told to see a neurologist in hopes of finding answers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'I was unable to move myself in bed, unable to use the restroom, was tube fed via g-tube and intubated. Eventually I required a tracheostomy and utilized a passy muir valve (PMV) for communication,' she told DailyMail.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She claims that her greatest motivation was her then-four-year-old daughter whom she feared she would never speak to again&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then by June 2019, Mrs Abraham visited a new neurologist at the University of California in San Diego who recognized her symptoms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She said: 'It was not until a few months after exiting the hospital environment that they finally diagnosed me. It was only because I saw a new neurologist. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'That neurologist was able to diagnose me in a few minutes based off what I was presenting with [cervical, brachial, pharyngeal paralysis]. She said she had seen this before in her career and was very confident I had the PCB-Variant of GB.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mrs Abraham was diagnosed with pharyngeal-cervical-brachial (PCB) variant, a rare form of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;GBS is a rare neurological disorder in which the patient's immune system mistakenly attacks part of their peripheral nerves, responsible for sending information from the brain to different body parts and back. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The condition typically starts to spread from the feet and legs and travels to the arms and face. However in Mrs Abraham's case, it began in her face and then went down her body - making it difficult for doctors to diagnose her. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She told DailyMail.com: 'In the ICU they tested me for GBS but quickly dismissed it because my variant took a different course to paralysis. Typical variants ascend from the feet up, and mine took the opposite - it went top down (head to feet).'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The PCB variant of GBS causes rapid weakness in muscles of the mouth and throat, cervical spine in the neck and nerves in the shoulder.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It also causes a complete absence of reflexes in the upper limbs and arms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Significant weakness in the mouth and throat can make it difficult to talk, swallow, chew and breathe. It can also cause a person to slur their speech, drool out of the mouth and lead to facial paralysis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weakness in the neck and shoulder make it hard to hold the head up and nerve problems - all symptoms Mrs Abraham was experiencing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As months went by, she started to slowly relearn how to swallow, speak and move &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Abraham pictured here with her husband as she spent time in rehab&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to BMJ Journals, most neurologists are unfamiliar with the PCB variant and often misdiagnose it as brainstem stroke, myasthenia gravis (a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disease causing muscle weakness and fatigue) or botulism (fatal poisoning and paralysis caused by a bacteria). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The causes of both GBS and its variants remain unknown, though they are believed to be triggered by an immune system response to an infection. &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13100755/Largest-Covid-vaccine-study-finds-shots-linked-small-increased-risk-neurological-blood-heart-disorders-extremely-rare.html"&gt;GBS has also been linked to the Covid vaccine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;GBS is diagnosed in about one in 78,000 people each year around the world. About one in 100,000 people are affected in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there is no known cure for GBS or any of its variants, therapies such as plasma exchange and immunoglobulin injections (proteins that your immune system naturally makes to attack invading organisms) can help alleviate symptoms and reduce recovery time if started within two weeks of developing GBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most people eventually recover from even the most severe cases of GBS and healthcare professionals tend to transfer patients to rehabilitation settings to improve. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, six years on from her life-changing diagnosis, Mrs Abraham, who is now able to speak clearly and walk, said: '&lt;span&gt;Recovery was awful, long and required a lot of mental health services to address severe depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I was unable to drive for nine months and eat for six. I didn't work for a year. I had a lot of pain and discomfort and exhaustion. I napped daily and spent a lot of time in outpatient rehab, at the gym, resting, and in therapy for depression.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She also revealed how she managed to interacte with people while re-learning how to speak: 'I communicated with a passy muir valve that is a device that is used with a tracheostomy. It was the most exhausting, scary and difficult procedure I have ever been through in my entire life. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Due to the nature of my disease, it made talking again hard. I had an extremely high level of secretions that would require a lot of suctioning in order to use the PMV and talk again. It was physically exhausting. The first time I used the PMV I was able to only use it for less than a minute because it was so hard. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Before the PMV I used every other modality as an SLP I could think of to talk. I pointed to pictures, typed on the letter board and when severe and unable to move anything in my body I used eye gaze.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Six years on from her life-changing diagnosis, Mrs Abraham is now able to speak clearly &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite her recovery, Mrs Abraham told DailyMail.com that her illness forever changed her life.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: '&lt;span&gt;I lost myself. I lost who I once was and had to say goodbye to many dreams for my future. I was profoundly depressed and missed myself and wanted to be the mom I envisioned I would be. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I am not as active as I once was. I was once able to run, hike mountains for miles and ride bikes and participate in yoga classes. I have had to stop doing all of that because I am simply not strong enough and cannot perform these tasks safely. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Being tube fed was depressing and isolating. I was no longer able to sit at the table and eat with my family. That is isolating. I was no longer able to work. I lost my identify as not only a mom and wife but also a SLP/working mom. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I no longer felt I fit into the world I once was an active participant in. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As for life now, she told DailyMail.com she still struggles - both physically and mentally. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She said: 'I am six years out and still participate in weekly ICU support groups for PICS [post intensive care syndrome]. I am unable to sleep through the night without anxiety attacks - I have insomnia.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Still, she is trying to move forward and raising her daughter, running a neurological rehab business called A Neu Healing where she helps patients recovery from neurological impairments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the end, Mrs Abrahams said: 'Surround yourself with people that "get it" and with that I mean that people you can connect with, that understand what you are going through. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'People that understand the grief, loss, depression and anxiety you are feeling through difficult times. For me, I found that through ICU support groups for Post Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS) and through the support of prayer warriors around the United States that experienced tragedy like mine.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Of course, there are lots of ways to improve your gut health, and some exciting new research is now suggesting that adding a very specific type of juice to your morning routine could help boost your gut health by tamping down gut inflammation. For the roughly 60 million Americans who struggle with gastrointestinal diseases, these findings could even prove life-changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what the study found, plus what gastroenterologists want you to keep in mind when interpreting the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://drashkanfarhadi.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ashkan Farhadi;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ashkan Farhadi&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a gastroenterologist at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA; &lt;a href="https://umg.rwjms.rutgers.edu/doctor_page.php?phys_id=125744" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ellen Stein,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ellen Stein,&lt;/a&gt; MD, a gastroenterologist and associate professor at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/15/2/306" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Life;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, focused on patients with &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a37144670/ulcerative-colitis-counting-macros-weight-loss-success-story/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ulcerative colitis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ulcerative colitis&lt;/a&gt;, a chronic inflammatory bowel disorder that causes stomach cramps and bloody diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers randomly assigned 35 patients between the ages of 18 and 65 to take either a 130 milliliter tart cherry drink made with 100 milliliters of water and 30 milliliters of concentrated &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a60329891/tart-cherry-juice-health-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tart cherry juice;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;tart cherry juice&lt;/a&gt; or a placebo drink (that had a similar look and taste) twice a day for six weeks. The participants continued to take their usual ulcerative colitis medications during this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers took a bunch of measurements during the study, including looking at the participants’ physical and mental health, and ulcerative colitis symptoms. The participants also gave regular blood and stool samples, and kept food diaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that people in the tart cherry drink group had a 40 percent reduction in calprotectin, a protein that’s released when there’s inflammation in the gut. Participants in the tart cherry drink group also reported a 9 percent improvement in their quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This trial indicates that twice-daily tart cherry supplementation can improve irritable bowel disorder-related quality of life as well as the severity of symptoms and therefore may be important in the management of ulcerative colitis,” the researchers wrote in the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does an inflamed gut affect your health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gut inflammation causes more than just intestinal discomfort, says &lt;a href="https://umg.rwjms.rutgers.edu/doctor_page.php?phys_id=125744" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ellen Stein,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ellen Stein,&lt;/a&gt; MD, a gastroenterologist and associate professor at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, it can cause lots of issues with your overall health, including joint pain, feeling tired or fatigued, dysbiosis [an imbalance of gut bacteria], or malabsorption, she says. It can also lead to worse symptoms of lactose intolerance or fructan sensitivity, Dr. Stein says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Treating the underlying cause of the disease is important— avoiding gluten for Celiac disease patients, calming inflammation with medication for irritable bowel disease patients, and eating a healthy diet and avoiding unnecessary antibiotics for those with gut [imbalance],” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it’s really important to take care of your gut, says &lt;a href="http://drashkanfarhadi.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ashkan Farhadi;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ashkan Farhadi&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a gastroenterologist at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA. “When the gut is inflamed, there’s a lot of inflammation throughout the body,” he says. “It causes a lot of trouble.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does tart cherry juice help reduce inflammation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to point out that this study was only done on a small group of people, and it was also funded by the Cherry Marketing Institute, a non-profit group that represents American cherries. (However, the organization didn’t influence the design of the study or the results.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, there are a few theories on why this drink may help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tart cherries have polyphenols, which are naturally occurring plant compounds that act as antioxidants, and which may help tamp down on inflammation, Dr. Stein says. “Some other theories suggest that there is a prebiotic effect of this substance,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can also just take these findings at face value, because there is a lot of information to show that the juice reduces inflammation in the group that took it compared to the placebo,” Dr. Farhadi says. “But we really have to take this with a grain of salt because there were only a few participants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Stein stresses that, at this point, more data is needed to prove this connection, since most studies on tart cherry juice are small and results have been mixed. “There is nothing truly convincing that this particular food is the key to all health,” she says. “That said, it probably tastes good and in moderation is a healthy food to consume.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much would I have to drink to see the positive effects?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not much. This particular study had people drink 130 milliliters of a tart cherry drink twice a day, which is a little less than 4.5 ounces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else can I do to reduce gut inflammation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While research into the potential impact of tart cherry juice on the gut is ongoing, doctors say there are a few things you can do to lower levels of inflammation in your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Stein suggests having a regular exercise routine, eating a healthy diet with fiber from natural sources, getting plenty of good quality sleep, trying to reduce chronic stress, and focusing on your overall health. “Eating a balanced diet with healthy foods and less processed foods also seems to help, like the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a60617751/mediterranean-diet-lowers-hypertension-risk-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 16:23:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE9kNlplS09tQTFmaEI3bzdJNXJrMU1LWENPODQzWTR3NFdwWERHWU9TZFZKQW5zNU1RMDFVR3BFLXBxdm1FQzA3eUhrQVBUUGRQUHNRWnNaUFd3RWsxZV9UbGRSVlRPaUxzTEl2Nk9TclRXU2tZRF9BYU5LcU84QQ</guid></item><item><title>新的电池技术可同时发电和净化废水- The Daily Galaxy | New Battery Tech Makes Power and Cleans Wastewater at the Same Time - The Daily Galaxy</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE0tdmprRF90YU1DUkNYdXlOb3NrdS1ZQzVJaF9Wc1VUTFlUczh2d1hrY3hhVS1BOEEwMVk2bFRJd1VJUmpwQ0lEZUNLRlVfQzBJbjJmbmpKUXBFZUVfdE5BcFZ1TlJGRGRSUnlYQS1JMjl6Um9QVVJnVmhmcVV4SGs?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;

Published in the journal&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652622012719" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; ACS Applied Materials &amp;amp; Interfaces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, their new technique uses &lt;strong&gt;zinc-air battery technology&lt;/strong&gt; to produce &lt;strong&gt;hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂)&lt;/strong&gt; in a way that is cleaner, cheaper, and potentially scalable — all while tackling toxic dyes from the textile industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Dual-purpose Battery Technology With Clean Production Potential&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zinc-air batteries have long been studied for their promise as &lt;strong&gt;low-cost, energy-dense alternatives&lt;/strong&gt; to lithium-ion systems. They rely on &lt;strong&gt;zinc metal&lt;/strong&gt; as the anode and &lt;strong&gt;ambient air&lt;/strong&gt; as the cathode.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this new study, IISc scientists have reengineered the zinc-air battery to not just store power, but also to &lt;strong&gt;generate hydrogen peroxide&lt;/strong&gt; as a &lt;strong&gt;byproduct of its discharge cycle&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The battery’s operation induces a &lt;strong&gt;reduction reaction at the cathode&lt;/strong&gt;, converting oxygen into H₂O₂ rather than simply &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/They-Were-Cleaning-Dirty-Water%E2%80%94What-They-Found-Could-Power-the-Future.jpg" data-type="attachment" data-id="83675" data-slb-active="1" data-slb-asset="1210948600" data-slb-internal="0" data-slb-group="86776"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. This feat, however, requires precise control of the chemical pathway — something the team achieved by integrating a &lt;strong&gt;metal-free, chemically modified carbon catalyst&lt;/strong&gt; into the system. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unlike traditional H₂O₂ manufacturing processes, which demand &lt;strong&gt;high energy input&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;precious metal catalysts&lt;/strong&gt;, this method offers a low-cost, metal-free alternative with significant emissions reductions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Hydrogen Peroxide as a Weapon Against Toxic Industrial Dyes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because hydrogen peroxide is colorless, they added &lt;strong&gt;toxic synthetic dyes&lt;/strong&gt; (commonly found in textile effluents) to the mix. When the peroxide is generated, it interacts with these dyes, causing a visible&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/04/color-might-love-doesnt-exist/"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;color change&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;and simultaneously &lt;strong&gt;breaking down the pollutants&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over time, this results in the &lt;strong&gt;complete degradation of color and toxicity&lt;/strong&gt;, showcasing a new approach to &lt;strong&gt;industrial wastewater treatment&lt;/strong&gt; using an &lt;strong&gt;energy storage system&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctoral researcher Asutosh Behera, lead author of the study, highlighted this &lt;strong&gt;dual-use concept&lt;/strong&gt;: generating a disinfectant and &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/04/is-air-pollution-blocking-the-sun/"&gt;degrading pollutants &lt;/a&gt;in a single, integrated process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The H2O2 generated will further decompose into various radicals (such as hydroxide and superoxide) — highly raw, reactive organic species — that will eventually degrade the textile dye,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Clean Leap Forward From Traditional H₂o₂ Production&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, producing hydrogen peroxide involves the &lt;strong&gt;anthraquinone process&lt;/strong&gt;, an energy-intensive method that consumes fossil fuels and emits carbon dioxide. It also depends on &lt;strong&gt;rare and expensive metals&lt;/strong&gt; like palladium or platinum as catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The IISc breakthrough bypasses these issues entirely. Using &lt;strong&gt;abundant zinc&lt;/strong&gt; (especially plentiful in India) and &lt;strong&gt;ambient oxygen&lt;/strong&gt;, the new method leverages &lt;strong&gt;chemical energy in batteries&lt;/strong&gt; to drive H₂O₂ production. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Professor Aninda J. Bhattacharyya, the study’s corresponding author, this makes the approach not only &lt;strong&gt;environmentally sustainable&lt;/strong&gt;, but also &lt;strong&gt;economically viable&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This method is very sustainable, low-cost, and highly energy-efficient,” Bhattacharyya stated in the institute’s release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;This Battery Might Power Your Home — And Clean Your Water&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study sits at the intersection of &lt;strong&gt;energy innovation&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;green chemistry&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;environmental remediation&lt;/strong&gt;. It opens the door to energy systems that are &lt;strong&gt;multifunctional&lt;/strong&gt; — capable not just of storing electricity, but also of &lt;strong&gt;performing useful chemical reactions&lt;/strong&gt; as part of their operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In rural or off-grid locations, such a system could simultaneously provide power and clean water. Hydrogen peroxide also serves in medical sterilization, wastewater purification, and textile processing, making this innovation potentially valuable across sectors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also contributes to the global trend of &lt;strong&gt;rethinking battery chemistry&lt;/strong&gt;. Researchers are revisiting older technologies — from &lt;strong&gt;iron-alkaline batteries&lt;/strong&gt; once championed by Thomas Edison to &lt;strong&gt;hydrogen-generating nickel cells&lt;/strong&gt; — and uncovering ways to repurpose byproducts once seen as problems into &lt;strong&gt;secondary outputs&lt;/strong&gt; for other industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

"Shaken baby syndrome is 100% preventable. Background shows that there's no demographics that it doesn't affect. It is purely done out of anger."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bodily saw her life changed through shaken baby syndrome in December 1997, when her son, Elijah Fisher, was shaken and killed by his father. Bodily's story came to light after she made known in Elijah's obituary how he died and some local news organizations reached out in response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Emily Bodily and her son Elijah are shown in this undated photo. A symbolic ribbon cutting marked the celebration of the National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome’s 25th anniversary as an organization on Tuesday in Farmington. (Photo: National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The last thing that I wanted was to explain over and over again, so it was just common sense to me to put how he died," Bodily said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, she ended up sharing her story with the world as the National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome later produced a documentary entitled Elijah's Story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that I was never prepared for something positive to come out of something so negative," Bodily said. "I am so happy to be able to be fighting against all of this and be able to have that chance to not let Elijah's voice die and be out there preventing this type of abuse until we can completely diminish it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's still a lot of work to be done. National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome Executive Director Danielle Velazquez said the organization has been monitoring cases in Utah with publicly available data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have increased substantially over the last few years," Velazquez explained. "A lot of times it's fathers, it's mothers, boyfriends, daycare providers … And every single story is related to frustration with infants."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome's main messages focus on what it calls &lt;a href="https://store.dontshake.org/category-s/108.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;the Period of PURPLE Crying&lt;/a&gt;, which begins around 2 months. The program is shared with hospitals and other health and childcare providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's the only evidence-based shaken baby center prevention program in the world that can actually show a reduction in cases by about 35% of shaking and 30% of infant physical abuse," Velasquez explained. "Our materials are provided to those new families after the birth of their new baby by those healthcare providers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="divbox"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tips for parents and caregivers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try calming a crying baby by swaddling in a blanket or holding baby against your bare skin

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Offer a pacifier, rock gently and sing or talking softly

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If possible, try taking a walk with stroller or going for drive in the car

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are getting upset, focus on calming yourself down. Parenting is hard work! It's OK to ask for help

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Put the baby in a safe place and walk away to calm down. Continue to check on the baby every five to 10 minutes

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider calling a friend, relative, neighbor, parent helpline, or your child's healthcare provider for support

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Call the doctor if you think the child is sick

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never leave your baby alone with a person who is easily irritated, has a temper, or a history of violence

			&lt;p&gt;Menstrual blood has historically been overlooked in research – considered only to be a &lt;a href="https://blogs.bmj.com/bmjsrh/2021/11/18/menstrual-blood-no-longer-just-a-waste-product/"&gt;waste product&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But menstrual blood actually has a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266657192400032X"&gt;rich cellular and molecular makeup&lt;/a&gt;. It contains immune cells, stems cells and endometrial cells – as well as metabolites such as proteins and lipids (fat). This makes menstrual blood a potential goldmine for insights into many different health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also be a less invasive way for researchers to access important biological material without the need for surgical biopsies or other invasive techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given its important composition, researchers are now using menstrual blood to investigate whether it can be used to uncover the causes of a disease, identify signs of a health condition and develop personalized treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One area where menstrual blood could be integral is research investigating  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/endometriosis" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73093" data-postid="158338" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;endometriosis&lt;/a&gt;. This condition causes endometrial tissue (which normally lines the uterus) to grow outside of the womb and on other organs, such as the bowel and ovaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research into endometriosis is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-023-01475-2/index.html"&gt;severely underfunded&lt;/a&gt;, despite it affecting &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/endometriosis"&gt;10 percent of women&lt;/a&gt;. It's also difficult to understand the mechanisms behind the disease without using invasive procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, current treatment options – which include surgical lesion removal, hormonal contraceptives and pain relief – fail to address the root cause or associated complications (such as infertility).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some researchers have managed to develop  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-an-organoid" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="106655" data-postid="158338" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;organoids&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02194-y"&gt;using the endometrial cells from menstrual blood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organoids are miniature, lab-grown 3D models of organs derived from the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="158338" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; found in the blood. These organoids can mimic what happens in the actual endometrium (the innermost lining of the uterus).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives researchers a non-invasive way to investigate the health status of the endometrium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By developing organoids from the menstrual blood of those suffering with endometriosis, researchers are able to model the disease in the lab. This may one day lead the way to better understanding the underlying mechanisms of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endometriosis is also considered to be an &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8836207/"&gt;inflammatory condition&lt;/a&gt;. This is because there's an over-activation of the immune system seen in people with endometriosis, which worsens symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, an area of high interest for research into endometriosis is the study of the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Menstrual blood contains &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24249743/"&gt;live immune cells&lt;/a&gt; which have come from the reproductive tract. These immune cells offer insight into the inflammation that's occurring in the womb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may help researchers better understand and develop treatments for painful sex, a common symptom for people with endometriosis which is &lt;a href="https://www.endofound.org/painful-sex-dyspareunia"&gt;linked to inflammation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the presence of endometrial cells makes it an ideal tool for studying endometriosis, menstrual blood is also being used to offer insights into other reproductive diseases. For example, it has unveiled immune differences in patients with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35560014/"&gt;recurrent pregnancy loss&lt;/a&gt; that was not previously detectable using blood from the vein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stem cell research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menstrual blood also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9580754/"&gt;contains stem cells&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it an important resource for research into a variety of other health conditions – including those involved in critical processes such as &lt;a href="https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1479-5876-5-57"&gt;cardiovascular function, respiration and nervous system function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stem cells are defined by their naive status and ability to become a new, specialized type of cell under the right conditions. Adult stem cells are usually taken from umbilical cord blood, amniotic fluid, bone marrow or fat tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it requires invasive techniques to extract a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="158338" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cell&lt;/a&gt; sample from these areas – and only small amounts can be acquired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But menstrual blood, a fluid which is typically produced monthly, has been found to contain &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9580754/"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; that are also capable of differentiating into various other cell types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is particularly exciting as menstrual blood is readily available, naturally regenerates and collecting it does not require any surgical procedures or discomfort. This makes it a convenient and ethical option for stem cell research and potential therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_158631" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-158631" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/BloodSugarGlucoseMonitor.jpg" alt="This Overlooked Waste Product Is Proving Useful For Medical Research" class="size-full wp-image-158631" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/BloodSugarGlucoseMonitor.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/BloodSugarGlucoseMonitor-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/BloodSugarGlucoseMonitor-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-158631" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Menstrual blood is even being used to monitor blood sugar levels. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEXEmmlehs/"&gt;Nataliya Vaitkevich/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from using these menstrual blood-derived stem cells to investigate reproductive diseases such as &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/molehr/article/20/9/905/2459769?login=true"&gt;endometriosis&lt;/a&gt;, there are also several studies looking at using these cells in other applications. For example, researchers have used them to investigate techniques for &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30656863/"&gt;promoting wound healing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/scd.2013.0390"&gt;improving blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt; in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="158338" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the topic of diabetes, menstrual blood is also being used for a proof-of-concept study to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34759003/"&gt;monitor glycaemic control&lt;/a&gt;. This offers alternatives to traditional blood tests – such as &lt;a href="https://qvin.com/"&gt;the Q pad&lt;/a&gt;, a pad which contains a removable collection strip for blood testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other diseases which are showing promising results in being diagnosed through menstrual blood include &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9377370/"&gt;cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11427561/"&gt;chlamydia&lt;/a&gt; and diseases associated with &lt;a href="https://sciforschenonline.org/journals/clinical-laboratory-medicine/JCLM130.php"&gt;lipid levels&lt;/a&gt; – such as atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The new normal?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menstrual blood is gaining traction in research due to its novelty and because it's a less invasive way to collect different cells and molecules for testing. It's easily accessible as a monthly "waste" product, and allows women to collect samples themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could bypass the need for doctors and nurses and the inconvenience of appointments if it becomes a more reliable diagnostic tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite its promise, there are practical challenges that researchers face. Discussion around menstrual blood is still &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/dirty-red-how-periods-have-been-stigmatised-through-history-to-the-modern-day-206967"&gt;sometimes seen as taboo&lt;/a&gt;. Some women may not feel comfortable handling their own blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also inconsistencies with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266657192400032X"&gt;how menstrual blood is collected&lt;/a&gt; between studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, studies which only required a smaller volume of menstrual blood have been able to make use of sanitary pads and tampons to collect samples. However, those which require a larger sample used menstrual cups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first issue with this is that the products used have different compositions, which can interfere with the reliability of the results. Another issue lies predominantly with menstrual cups and the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11205264/"&gt;lack of knowledge&lt;/a&gt; surrounding their proper use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, addressing stigma and promoting awareness around menstrual blood research is vital. While it has historically been overlooked, menstrual blood must now be recognized as a powerful, non-invasive tool in advancing research.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/253384/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Hess&lt;/a&gt;, MD, Dean at the Medical College of Georgia and a neurologist and stroke specialist, who was not involved in the study, explained that “One of the tests they use is a novel object recognition. So a smart mouse is going to explore a new object it’s never seen before… this is a very standardized test that we do in the lab to measure cognition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another test was the Morris water maze, which involved finding a hidden underwater platform based on previous tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After behavioral testing, researchers were able to examine the brain tissue of mice for further analysis, as well as vitamin K in the liver and kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Low vitamin K vs. regular diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, mice on the low vitamin K diet saw worse outcomes than mice who received a regular diet. For one thing, researchers found that male mice who had the low vitamin K diet had a decreased survival rate. They also had a lower weight gain than female control mice. Female mice on the low vitamin K diet did not experience these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The researchers also found that mice on the low vitamin K diet had lower levels of Menaquinone-4 (MK4) in the brain. MK4 is the major form of vitamin K when it is present in the brain. There were also lower levels of vitamin K in the liver and kidneys of the mice on the low vitamin K diet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the novel object recognition test, mice on the low vitamin K diet did not explore the novel object as much as the control mice. This implies these mice had problems with recognition memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice on the low vitamin K diet also took longer on the first three days of the Morris water maze learning how to locate the hidden platform. Over the four days, they also took longer than controls, but this level did not reach a level of statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also noted differences in the hippocampus area of the mice’s brains if they were on the low vitamin K diet. The mice with the low vitamin K diet had decreased neurogenesis in this brain area. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-540-29678-2_3846" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Neurogenesis&lt;/a&gt; has to do with the body creating neurons that are mature and able to appropriately function. These findings suggest that vitamin K may affect neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hess explained the following to &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In mice and in all mammals, we don’t make new neurons, usually throughout the brain. We make them in specific areas. So one area where they’re made, and this has actually also been shown in humans, is the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. So the hippocampus is the part of the brain that’s best associated with recent memory, which is affected very early in Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The study authors speculate that vitamin K’s impact on hippocampal neurogenesis may then affect cognitive functions like learning and memory that are related to the work of the hippocampus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that mice on the low vitamin K diet had changes in specific cells called microglial cells in the hippocampus, which suggested the activation of these cells. These observations of the microglial cells indicated increased neuroinflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These results suggest that low vitamin K may induce an increase in neuroinflammation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors speculate that vitamin K might protect hippocampal neurogenesis in part through its anti-inflammatory effects. Vitamin K’s effects on cognition could also be somewhat related to how it affects inflammation and protects against oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research offers critical insight into the potential impact of vitamin K on learning and memory. However, it also has limitations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one thing, mouse studies provide limited information on how low vitamin K affects brain function in people. The researchers also chose to focus on a specific form of vitamin K that is present in human diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also only had so many mice left for behavioral testing because of the higher death of male mice in the low vitamin K diet group. The authors acknowledge that the final endpoints of the study also did not have data from the male mice who died before the study was over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other factors could have affected the observed results, too. For example, the authors note that vitamin K could be involved in metabolizing a cell membrane component called sphingolipids. They note that sphingolipids “contribute to proliferation, differentiation, and neuroinflammation.” They explain that more research is required to see if the changes to sphingolipids from low vitamin K are involved in neuroinflammation and hippocampal neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were also unable to measure proteins dependent on vitamin K in the brain and levels of an enzyme called γ-glutamyl carboxylase because of the limited amount of brain tissue and the experiments they ran. It’s possible these proteins were responsible for the observed effects of vitamin K, so more research is likely required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also unclear how the severity of impairment from vitamin K deficiency relates to the time frame of deficiency and mouse age. More research is also needed to understand the observed differences between male and female mice. These aspects can all be looked at in future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/medicine_greenville/about/faculty/facultydir/pfdf397e49fe28695136703cf185c11023" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Ryan Hakimi&lt;/a&gt;, DO, MS, a neurointensivist and osteopathic physician, who was not involved in the study, noted the following regarding the potential clinical implications to &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The study reinforces the importance of healthy dietary habits for improved cognitive function.

For the first time, scientists have discovered tiny plastic particles in human ovarian follicular fluid, raising serious concerns about their impact on female fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growing impact of plastic pollution on the human body is becoming increasingly evident, as tiny plastic particles, even thinner than a hair strand, silently infiltrate the brain, heart, lungs, and other vital organs, affecting their function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety, researchers looked for microplastics in the follicular fluid of 18 women going through assisted reproductive treatment at a fertility clinic in Salerno, Italy, and found them in 14 samples. Here's the alarming impact of microplastics in human ovaries. Let's first understand what follicular fluid is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you believe that microplastics pose a significant risk to women's reproductive health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is follicular fluid?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luigi Montano, the lead author of the study and a researcher at the University of Rome says the findings are 'very alarming', and also crucial in terms of understanding the impact of microplastic on women's reproductive systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Montano's current findings are part of a larger project that also found microplastics in human urine and semen, and examined the impact on male fertility. The researcher said microplastics could be behind the declining sperm counts and a drop in sperm quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Impact of microplastic on women's health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While men are more affected by the toxic effects of microplastics, the impact on women is no less. Animal research has linked microplastics to ovarian dysfunction and health problems, like reduced oocyte maturation, and a lower capacity for fertilization. It can also lead to alterations to ovarian tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Montano said that bisphenol, phthalates, Pfas and other highly toxic chemicals that use microplastics as a “Trojan horse” to get into the body, and into the ovaries, are 'very dangerous'. They can disrupt hormones and harm women's reproductive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Reproductive health risks&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics have been detected in human ovarian follicular fluid for the first time, raising concerns about their potential impact on female fertility. These particles could interfere with the development and maturation of eggs, affecting reproductive health and hormone levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Hormonal disruption&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics contain endocrine-disrupting chemicals that can mimic or interfere with the body’s hormones. In women, this can lead to imbalances in estrogen, progesterone, and other key hormones, potentially contributing to conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), thyroid disorders, and irregular menstrual cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Increased risk of inflammatory diseases&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics, when absorbed into the bloodstream, may trigger inflammation throughout the body. Chronic inflammation is linked to a variety of health issues, including autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular problems, and even certain cancers. Women may be more vulnerable due to differences in immune system responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Impact on pregnancy and fetal development&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposure to microplastics during pregnancy may have potential risks for both maternal and fetal health. The particles could cross the placenta, affecting fetal development and leading to complications such as low birth weight or developmental delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Respiratory and digestive issues&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inhalation and ingestion of microplastics can cause respiratory issues, such as irritation and inflammation in the lungs. Women, particularly those in urban environments, are at risk of developing chronic conditions like asthma or bronchitis due to continuous exposure. Similarly, ingestion may disrupt digestive health, leading to gastrointestinal discomfort or long-term issues like gut inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Microplastics and male fertility&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics are formed due to breaking down or decomposition of plastic that leads to formation of numerous microplastics (MPs), less than 5 mm in diameter. They enter the soil, and ocean. They become part of the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 15% of couples worldwide face &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9134445/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;infertility&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, with nearly half of the cases linked to male factors. Male semen quality has significantly declined over the years. From 1940 to 1990, sperm concentration dropped from 113 million/ml to 66 million/ml. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also observed this decline, reducing the normal semen concentration value from 60 million/ml in 1980 to 15 million/ml in 2010, with little change in the latest 2021 guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This decline in sperm quality over the past 80 years coincides with the rise of plastic pollution. While other factors like obesity, diet, and environmental toxins may also play a role, plastic pollution remains a major persistent threat to male fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Covid-19 podcast: Closest known relatives of Covid virus found.

While most people know to cut down on salt when trying to control their blood pressure, a new study has revealed this might not actually be the best plan of action.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Professor Anita Layton of the University of Waterloo said: “Our research suggests that adding more potassium-rich foods to your diet, such as bananas or broccoli, might have a greater positive impact on your blood pressure than just cutting sodium.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In simple terms, the study claims managing high blood pressure could be as simple as comparing how much potassium and sodium we eat. Potassium is mostly commonly found in fruits like bananas, potatoes, spinach and avocados while sodium is in most fast food, pizza, bread and ready meals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Published in the &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajprenal.00222.2024" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;American Journal of Physiology Renal Physiology&lt;/a&gt;, the new research found that increasing your potassium intake helps your body cover and regulate after having sodium. Essentially, sodium increases your blood pressure and bananas can drop it, so combining both of these simple diet swaps could make some powerful changes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers even claimed that looking at the sodium to potassium ratio of your diet could “be a stronger predictor for blood pressure, risk of cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality” than only focusing on one of these compounds. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This also matches the current global trends. Western diets are often packed with sodium and are low in fruits and vegetables, where potassium would come in so our bodies aren't equipped to handle the amount of sodium we’re taking on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study explained: If your sodium intake and blood pressure is high but you increase the amount of potassium you eat, this could stabilise your blood pressure by washing out the excess sodium. Men were found to be more likely to have high blood pressure but also more likely to benefit from these dietary changes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Future research is expected to see how medications interact with this system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 14:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNNDNFcnQ5M0RGN3c0OGljNHRjNVRNOFFEM2dEWWYtblJ5WXF5N3huVFJnbTdPRnpWR1U0UzJ0UWRzVDRYdWRxYWktTnk3dGJyNVpUTy1LY0JZQktBMWtvSFZSUTFRcUp2SlJGVWhrdFoyMnhXeWpjQkFXNGtYSUF3X0w0LVNkM2pM</guid></item><item><title>致癌砷在世界大米中积聚- Gizmodo | Cancer-Causing Arsenic Is Building Up in the World’s Rice - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxOVzlES1JSSTh4b2ktaXZhT05PalN1bS1NRXdmeTZlam1BTVVkS2dRMFpGUWtpZkdBc19pbFBmY2l2Mms3eEZ4YjlTYlhmXzFTbFdSLUNuakQ1NDlDSHc0X3I3TFBucDBfTi12MGk4SWpqdDdRekNTYzF0OXBZMlQ2d1dESk5kWWZrdElyQ0xrc2E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was originally published by &lt;a title="Grist" href="https://grist.org"&gt;Grist&lt;/a&gt;. Sign up for Grist’s &lt;a title="Weekly newsletter" href="https://go.grist.org/signup/weekly/partner?utm_campaign=republish-content&amp;amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;amp;utm_source=partner"&gt;weekly newsletter here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Throughout the Yangtze River Delta, a region in southern China famed for its widespread rice production, farmers grow belts of slender green stalks. Before they reach several feet tall and turn golden brown, the grassy plants soak in muddy, waterlogged fields for months. Along the rows of submerged plants, levees store and distribute a steady supply of water that farmers source from nearby canals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;This traditional practice of flooding paddies to raise the notoriously thirsty crop is almost as old as the ancient grain’s domestication. Thousands of years later, the agricultural method continues to predominate in rice cultivation practices from the low-lying fields of Arkansas to the sprawling terraces of Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;As the planet heats up, this popular process of growing rice is becoming increasingly more dangerous for the millions of people worldwide that eat the grain regularly, according to &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(25)00055-5/fulltext"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday in the journal Lancet Planetary Health. After drinking water, the researchers say, rice is the world’s second largest dietary source of inorganic arsenic, and climate change appears to be increasing the amount of the highly toxic chemical that is in it. If nothing is done to transform how most of the world’s rice is produced, regulate how much of it people consume, or mitigate warming, the authors conclude that communities with rice-heavy diets could begin confronting increased risks of cancer and disease as soon as 2050.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;“Our results are very scary,” said Donming Wang, the ecological doctorate student at the Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences who led the paper. “It’s a disaster … and a wake-up call.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Back in 2014, Wang and an international team of climate, plant, and public health scientists started working together on a research project that would end up taking them close to a decade to complete. Wading through rice paddies across the Yangtze Delta, they sought to find out just how projected temperatures and levels of atmospheric CO2 in 2050 would interact with the arsenic in the soil and the rice crops planted there. They knew, from past research, that the carcinogen was a problem in rice crops, but wanted to find out how much more of an issue it might be in a warming world. The team didn’t look at just any rice, but some of the grain varieties most produced and consumed worldwide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Although there are &lt;a href="https://www.riceassociation.org.uk/types-of-rice"&gt;an estimated 40,000 types of rice&lt;/a&gt; on the planet, they tend to be grouped into three categories based on length of the grain. Short-grain rice, or the sticky kind often used in sushi; long-grain, which includes aromatic types like basmati and jasmine; and medium-grain, or rice that tends to be &lt;a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/types-of-rice?srsltid=AfmBOop6Nx25mqFpHopqAD6gC-ZdLve2kvlZ8nEYym0Dfl8RwLT2cIxb"&gt;served as a main dish&lt;/a&gt;. Of these, the short-to-medium japonica and long-grain indica are the &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fpls.2022.857896/full"&gt;two major subspecies of cultivated rice&lt;/a&gt; eaten across Asia. Wang’s study modelled the growth of 28 varieties of japonica, indica, and hybrid rice strains central to cuisine for seven of the continent’s top rice consuming and producing countries: Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Philippines, and Vietnam. India, Vietnam, and China are among the group of &lt;a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/crops/rice/trade#:~:text=Despite%20its%20current%20export%20restrictions,of%20annual%20global%20rice%20exports."&gt;eight nations&lt;/a&gt; that lead the rest of the world in rice exports.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;After nearly a decade of observing and analyzing the growth of the plants, the researchers discovered that the combination of higher temperatures and CO2 encourages root growth, increasing the ability of rice plants to uptake arsenic from the soil. They believe this is because climate-related changes in soil chemistry that favor arsenic can be more easily absorbed into the grain. Carbon-dioxide enriched crops were found to capture more atmospheric carbon and pump some of that into the soil, stimulating microbes that are making arsenic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;The more root growth, the more carbon in the soil, which can be a source of food for soil bacteria that multiply under warming temperatures. When soil in a rice paddy is waterlogged, oxygen gets depleted, causing the soil bacteria to rely further on arsenic to generate energy. The end result is more arsenic building up in the rice paddy, and more roots to take it up to the developing grain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;These arsenic-accumulating effects linked to increased root growth and carbon capture is a paradoxical surprise to Corey Lesk, a Dartmouth College postdoctoral climate and crop researcher unaffiliated with the paper. The paradox, said Lesk, is that both of these outcomes have been talked about as potential benefits to rice yields under climate change. “More roots could make the rice more drought-resistant, and cheaper carbon can boost yields generally,” he said. “But the extra arsenic accumulation could make it hard to realize health benefits from that yield boost.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Arsenic comes in many different forms. Notoriously toxic, inorganic arsenic — compounds of the element that don’t contain carbon — is what the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/arsenic"&gt;classifies&lt;/a&gt; as a “confirmed carcinogen” and “the most significant chemical contaminant in drinking water globally.” Such forms of arsenic are &lt;a href="https://sites.dartmouth.edu/toxmetal/arsenic/the-facts-on-arsenic/"&gt;typically more toxic&lt;/a&gt; to humans because they are less stable than their organic counterparts and may allow arsenic to interact with molecules that ramp up exposure. Chronic exposure has been linked to lung, bladder, and skin cancers, as well as heart disease, diabetes, adverse pregnancy, neurodevelopmental issues, and weakened immune systems, among other health impacts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Scientists and public-health specialists have known for years that the presence of arsenic in food is a mounting threat, but dietary exposure has long been considered much less of a risk in comparison to contaminated groundwater. So policy measures to mitigate the risk have been slow going. The few existing standards that have been enacted by the European Union and China, for example, are considered inconsistent and largely unenforced. No country has formally established regulations for organic arsenic exposure in foods. (In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration has established &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/chemical-metals-natural-toxins-pesticides-guidance-documents-regulations/supporting-document-action-level-inorganic-arsenic-rice-cereals-infants"&gt;an action level of 100 parts per billion of inorganic arsenic in infant rice cereal&lt;/a&gt;, but that recommendation for manufacturers isn’t an enforceable regulation on arsenic in rice or any other food.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Wang hopes to see this change. The levels of inorganic arsenic commonly found in rice today fall within China’s recommended standards, for example, but her paper shows that lifetime bladder and lung cancer incidences are likely to increase “proportionally” to exposure by 2050. Under a “worst case” climate scenario, where global temperatures rise above 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and are coupled with CO2 levels that increase another &lt;a href="https://grist.org/article/humans-didnt-exist-the-last-time-there-was-this-much-co2-in-the-air/"&gt;200 parts per million&lt;/a&gt;, the levels of inorganic arsenic in the rice varieties studied are projected to surge by a whopping 44 percent. That means that more than half the rice samples would exceed China’s current proposed limit, which limits 200 parts per billion for inorganic arsenic in paddy rice, with an estimated 13.4 million cancers linked to rice-based arsenic exposure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Because these health risks are in part calculated based on body weight, infants and young children will face the biggest health burdens. Babies, in particular, may end up facing outsize risks through the consumption of rice cereals, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;“You’re talking about a crop staple that feeds billions of people, and when you consider that more carbon dioxide and warmer temperatures can significantly influence the amount of arsenic in that staple, the amount of health consequences related to that are, for lack of a better word, enormous,” said study coauthor Lewis Ziska, a plant biologist researching climate change and public health at Columbia University.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;But everyone should not suddenly stop eating rice as a result, he added. Though the team found the amount of inorganic arsenic in rice is higher than a lot of other plants, it’s still quite low overall. The key variable is how much rice a person eats. If you are among the bulk of the world that consumes rice multiple times a week, this looming health burden could apply to you, but if you do so more sporadically, Ziska says, the inorganic arsenic you may end up exposed to won’t be “a big deal.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;In that way, the study’s projections may also deepen existing global and social inequities, as a big reason rice has long reigned as one of the planet’s most devoured grains is because it’s also among the most affordable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Beyond mitigating global greenhouse gas emissions — what Ziska calls “waving my rainbows, unicorns, and sprinkles wand” — adaptation efforts to avoid a future with toxic rice include rice paddy farmers planting earlier in the season to avoid seeds developing under warmer temperatures, better soil management, and plant breeding to minimize rice’s propensity to accumulate so much arsenic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Water-saving irrigation techniques such as alternate wetting and drying, where paddy fields are first flooded and then allowed to dry in a cycle, could also be used to reduce these increasing health risks &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the grain’s enormous methane footprint. On a global scale, rice production accounts for roughly &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/20/climate/rice-farming-climate-change.html"&gt;8 percent of all methane emissions from human activity&lt;/a&gt; — flooded paddy fields are ideal conditions for &lt;a href="https://climateandhealthalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MethaneReport-Ag-FINAL.pdf"&gt;methane-emitting bacteria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;“This is an area that I know is not sexy, that doesn’t have the same vibe as the end of the world, rising sea levels, category 10 storms,” said Ziska. “But I will tell you quite honestly that it will have the greatest effect in terms of humanity, because we all eat.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared in &lt;a href="https://grist.org/"&gt;Grist&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://grist.org/food-and-agriculture/the-king-of-poisons-arsenic-is-building-up-in-rice/"&gt;https://grist.org/food-and-agriculture/the-king-of-poisons-arsenic-is-building-up-in-rice/&lt;/a&gt;.

That ambulance took her to Mercy Medical Center in Aurora, which is only a four-minute drive away from the Albrights’ home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a hospital the two had been to before — he had previously been hospitalized there after a stroke, and his wife had surgery done there, Rick Albright told The Beacon-News. He said the two had long been cared for by doctors with Advocate Health Care, a non-profit medical group with a large presence in Aurora, and when they previously went to Mercy Medical Center, Advocate doctors were there to see them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the two arrived at Mercy Medical Center’s emergency room on Christmas Eve in 2023 and learned she had a gastric issue, they were told that her Advocate gastroenterologist, the same one who had previously operated on her at that same hospital, would not be able to see her, according to Rick Albright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said it was the first time he’d heard that Advocate doctors may not be able to see them at Mercy Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-wQoDAMss" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_wQoDAMss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the on-call doctor did a great job, eventually doing surgery to remove some gallstones, it was “completely luck of the draw,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of stories could become more common now that Advocate has pulled its doctors out of Mercy Medical Center without broadly informing its patients of the change. Around a half-dozen people who currently work or recently stopped working at Mercy confirmed to The Beacon-News that Advocate doctors were being pulled from Mercy Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement sent to The Beacon-News, Advocate said that it is “shifting all hospital-based services to Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital in Downers Grove and surrounding hospitals,” which is being done to “provide the best and highest quality care for our patients where they need it most” and “help us continue to coordinate and integrate care for our patients who need hospital-based services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the care Advocate provides to its patients takes place at its clinics, the locations of which are not changing, according to the statement from Advocate.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;When an Advocate spokesperson was asked when and how patients are being notified of this change, they said it is being done “as part of the scheduling process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Healthcare, which recently &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/03/01/ascension-completes-sale-of-9-illinois-hospitals-to-prime-healthcare-for-more-than-370-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;bought Mercy Medical Center along with a number of other hospitals from Ascension&lt;/a&gt;, also confirmed that Advocate Heath has decided to “prohibit their physicians from continuing to provide care at our hospital.” However, there is currently “no impact to the hospital’s emergency care and no impact to patient care or access,” a Mercy spokesperson recently told The Beacon-News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Healthcare asked Advocate to reconsider its decision, but “our efforts were declined,” the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight Advocate cardiologists, the last Advocate physicians at the hospital, were officially pulled out of Mercy Medical Center on April 5, according to the Mercy spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocate previously offered other types of care at Mercy — including ENT, pulmonology, urology, and hospitalist care — but those doctors were pulled out ahead of Prime’s purchase of the hospital, the Mercy spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Vitale, a certified registered nurse anesthetist who has been working at Mercy Medical Center for about 15 years, said that Advocate general surgeons and gastroenterologists were among the first to go. Both have been gone for over a year, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Advocate Health Care doctors were pulled out late last year or the start of this year, including orthopedics; ear, nose and throat doctors; pulmonology; urology; critical care doctors; podiatry and hospitalists, according to Richa Sharma, a doctor who up until Feb. 14 worked in Mercy Medical Center’s intensive care unit and was the hospital’s chair of internal medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharma and Vitale, neither of whom work for Advocate Health, were among those who agreed to come forward publicly to confirm Advocate was pulling its doctors out of Mercy Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharma said that Advocate hospitalists used to make up between 30% and 50% of all the hospitalists working at Mercy Medical Center. Hospitalists act as general doctors and coordinate care among other physicians for patients in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of Mercy Medical Center’s surgical care also used to come from Advocate Health Care, according to Vitale. While she has seen a lot of changes in administration at Mercy over the years, she has never seen anything like this, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked to confirm which types of Advocate doctors no longer work at Mercy Medical Center, an Advocate spokesperson referred to the company’s statement on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some specialist departments at Mercy Medical Center were hit harder by Advocate’s pull-out than others. Sharma told The Beacon-News late last year that the group she works for — Sound Physicians — was contracted to provide 50% of critical care at Mercy, while the other half came from Advocate Health Care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Healthcare decided to go with a different group for critical care services, which is why Sharma no longer works at Mercy, she told The Beacon-News last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercy Medical Center’s pulmonology, orthopedic surgery and ear, nose and throat departments used to also be staffed primarily by Advocate doctors, according to Sharma. But, she said late last year that there was another group already providing podiatry services at Mercy, and they were going to continue, so “that wouldn’t be a huge gap.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line, Sharma said at the time, was that Advocate pulling out of Mercy Medical Center was an additional layer of instability on top of the instability caused by Prime’s purchase of the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Prime now says it has closed any gaps left by Advocate pulling out its doctors, Sharma said in January that the hospital was having to make deals with other local hospitals to take patients because of gaps in coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All the anticipated effects are playing out currently,” Sharma said in January about Advocate pulling its doctors out of Mercy Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, deals were still being worked out with groups to cover orthopedics and urology, there was no pulmonology coverage and there were questions around ear, nose and throat coverage, she said in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rick Albright called the situation “silly” when he spoke to The Beacon-News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re the second biggest city in Illinois, and Advocate, who I’ve been involved with since they were Dreyer, they’re trying to send us all over the place for our procedures,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Rose Anne Albright had wanted to see her own Advocate doctor that Christmas Eve after being examined while in great pain at Mercy Medical Center, the same hospital where her Advocate doctor previously handled her surgery, she would have needed to take another ambulance to Good Samaritan Hospital in Downers Grove, which “makes no sense at all and is extremely expensive,” Rick Albright said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While those with Advocate doctors are still able to come get procedures done at Mercy, it would be out of network for them, Sharma told The Beacon-News. She said that means procedures may be more costly and harder to get approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercy Medical Center provides care to an “underserved community,” and many local residents are no longer going to have access to hospital care within their own community if they are patients of Advocate Health Care and do not have the means to travel beyond the city, according to Vitale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another concern of Vitale’s is that, as Mercy Medical Center loses doctors, quality staff may also be lost. She also wonders if Mercy will be able to maintain the same standard of care that the hospital has provided over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She loves the hospital, she said, and thinks it is a unique place that has maintained a community and family feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s strategically in a great location. It’s in the middle of a large community of people,” Vitale said about Mercy Medical Center. “I feel like this community needs that resource.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocate Health Care has similarly pulled doctors out of Rush Copley Medical Center, the other hospital in Aurora, but that process has been more gradual than what happened at Mercy, Rush Copley’s President and CEO John Diederich told The Beacon-News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, Advocate doctors used to make up around 50% of Rush Copley’s patient care revenue, but that has been dropping since then, falling to around 35% in the 2000s and to around 25% in the 2010s, according to Diederich. He said a more “dramatic” pull-out happened in 2022, when Advocate did not renew the lease on a large space on Rush Copley’s campus that it held for 13 years then started pulling its doctors from the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between mid-2022 and early 2023, 90% of Advocate specialists resigned from Rush Copley’s medical staff, Diederich said. That included Advocate ophthalmologists, pulmonologists, orthopedic surgeons, general surgeons, GI doctors and OB-GYNs, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Advocate doctors remain, including cardiologists, nephrologists and hospitalists, but they only make up around 5% of the hospital’s patient care revenue at this point, Diederich said in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Advocate Health Care’s pullout of Rush Copley was a hit to the hospital’s revenues, which Diederich called a “short-term bump,” Rush Copley has been able to recover, both filling in the gaps that Advocate left behind with its own medical group and expanding that medical group to keep up with the community’s growth, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think Advocate’s short-term strategy was our long-term opportunity,” Diederich said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercy Medical Center’s spokesperson said that, despite Advocate pulling its doctors out, the hospital has no gaps in care or coverage and remains “deeply committed to our mission of providing compassionate, accessible and community-based care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Prime Healthcare has successfully transitioned services in the past, and we will continue to do so with the same level of diligence and dedication,” the spokesperson said. “Our patients deserve nothing less.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="37" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na3012001b3b73llcxj7kr@published"&gt;My husband, “Mason,” and I have a 6-year-old daughter, “Evelyn,” who is the joy of our lives. She is an only child and we are satisfied with keeping it that way. The problem is my mother-in-law, “Clara.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="175" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na304r001c3b73fy23y7u2@published"&gt;For the past few years, Clara has insisted that Evelyn needs a sibling so she doesn’t grow up “spoiled and lonely.” She is convinced Evelyn will be “socially deprived” without the experience of having a sibling. But Evelyn is none of those things. Mason and I have clear boundaries and expectations for our daughter, and she has many friends at school and in her martial arts class; she is a happy, well-adjusted child. The other day, when she was at a friend’s for a play date, her friend’s 3-year-old brother ran up and kicked over a tower of blocks Evelyn and her friend had been stacking. After we got home, Evelyn told me she was glad not to have a younger brother or sister. So it’s not as if she’s feeling deprived! Clara, however, cannot seem to accept the fact that Evelyn is going to remain an only child. All our assurances that she and we are fine with things as they are fall on deaf ears. How can I get her to butt out?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na30dl001f3b73jmxu6ikc@published"&gt;For starters, instead of continuing to assure her that you, her son, and her grandchild are happy as you all are (which she either doesn’t believe or thinks is irrelevant), it’s time to address the overarching issue: her feeling entitled to offer this unasked-for advice—and not just once, but again and again. Tell her directly—or, better yet, ask her son to tell her directly—that this isn’t something that’s open for discussion with her. You’ve let this go on for &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt;. It’s time to put a stop to it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na30g6001g3b73k0k7u7q5@published"&gt;I feel honor bound to point out that telling her directly to butt out probably won’t work. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it. It’s important to communicate clearly with the people in our lives; it’s important to set boundaries with them, too. While you can’t actually “get” her to lay off, you can—and should—refuse to engage if (when) she continues to offer her two cents (on this and any other off-limits topic). Raise an eyebrow, sigh loudly, say, “We talked about this, remember?” or just blithely change the subject. You can end the conversation altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="159" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na30l3001h3b73l24kidf7@published"&gt;I have to ask (it’s my job to ask) if there’s any chance that she’s hitting a nerve with her constant criticism (because that is what this amounts to). Often when someone gets under our skin this way, it’s at least partly because they’re poking at a sensitive spot. &lt;em&gt;Do&lt;/em&gt; you have any nagging doubts you’re suppressing? I think it’s worth asking yourself this question for your own sake, entirely separate from your buttinsky mother-in-law problem. (For the record, I am a big fan of only children and the parents who have them.) As to that buttinsky mother-in-law herself, perhaps it will help to remind yourself that you don’t know what her motivation is. Is she really worried about Evelyn? (Maybe. But that’s her problem, not yours.) Does she simply want more grandchildren? (Again, not your problem.) Is she just the sort of person who believes she always knows best? (I could keep going, but you get the idea.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="39" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na3gpa001q3b73urdpa5dh@published"&gt;My family and I live down the block from my sister and her family. They went away for spring break to visit her in-laws and tasked my 12-year-old daughter “Blair” with feeding their tropical fish while they were gone.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="188" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na3gpa001r3b73wljlyqpt@published"&gt;The day before they were due back, Blair went over in the morning to feed the fish and discovered they were all dead. It turned out that the tank heater had failed at some point during the previous day after Blair took care of them. The problem is that my sister is blaming Blair for “killing” her fish and demanding that we pay for new ones. Blair feels terrible about what happened, but she did a temperature check of the water before she left on the last day they were alive, and the temperature was where it was supposed to be (she had been writing it down on the daily temperature log, so we know for sure), so there was no negligence on her part. I explained this to my sister, but she won’t budge.  Now she says Blair and her cousins (with whom she is very close) can’t play together until we pay for new fish. My husband thinks this is outrageous, and I agree. Even so, would buying some new fish be worth it so we can put this in the rearview mirror for Blair’s sake?&lt;/p&gt;

What’s your relationship with your sister like, anyway? It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; outrageous for her to demand that you pay to replace the fish that died because of her faulty heater. (Has Blair talked to her herself? Does she think Blair is lying? Or are you the one doing all the talking, relaying to your sister what Blair has told you—and does she think &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are lying? Do you and your sister have a long history of anger and bitterness between you? Or does your sister have a history of lashing out and blaming others for her misfortunes?)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="146" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na3gpc001v3b73jvslvlfo@published"&gt;Whatever is behind this, you need to have a conversation. Giving in to your sister’s blackmail, replacing the fish “for Blair’s sake,” so that she will be allowed to play with her cousins, will put only this very specific situation in the rearview mirror—it will not solve the underlying problem. If that problem cannot be solved (or if you don’t care enough to want to solve it; if your relationship with your sister has always been rocky and you’re fine with keeping the status quo), but you don’t want the kids to suffer for it, I would go ahead and pay for the fish if you can afford it, simply to keep the peace. But I would have a frank talk with Blair about why you’re doing this. Otherwise, it will be very confusing to her, as it suggests that you do consider her at fault.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="39" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na3gpd001w3b73wexgsgit@published"&gt;And if the matter is “resolved” in this way, I would definitely not have her be “tasked” with any house- or pet-sitting or other duties for her aunt in the future. Give her permission to politely decline such requests.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na3gpd001x3b73xzhwijdw@published"&gt;But oh how I hope—optimist that I am—that you and your sister can have a healthy, honest, authentic conversation that provides insight for both of you into the real reasons for this conflict, and that your relationship going forward is itself healthier, more honest, and more authentic. It is what I wish for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na4soa00263b73oow3ngq9@published"&gt;My granddaughter, “Carmen,” is very bright and bubbly most of the time. A few years ago, a freak accident triggered a chronic illness. She can walk, usually with a cane, but for long distances she usually makes use of a wheelchair. She has been complaining to me lately about how her parents baby her. For example, if her brothers want to take part in a family activity in an area of the city that isn’t wheelchair-accessible, her parents will dismiss the idea “for Carmen’s sake,” even though Carmen herself feels perfectly capable of walking for the distance required.&lt;/p&gt;

Perhaps because of the months she has spent in and out of the hospital, she is more mature than many other kids her age. I personally trust Carmen’s ability to judge her own abilities. I also understand that Carmen’s parents are scared. But their overprotectiveness is not doing Carmen any favors. I’m not sure how best to broach the conversation with my son and daughter-in-law. They have both been very defensive in the past about the way they handled Carmen’s hospitalization and illness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na4soe00293b73sn3zwq2b@published"&gt;Don’t broach the conversation at all. I promise you: Your advice on this matter will not be welcome. If you were paying attention, you might have learned this lesson when they were “defensive” about the way they “handled” Carmen’s illness and hospitalization years ago. Think of it this way: They should not have to defend their parenting to their child’s grandmother. The child’s grandmother should be keeping her own counsel.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na4soe002a3b739qg6duak@published"&gt;What you can do, of course, is be supportive of Carmen. When she comes to you complaining about her parents, you can be sympathetic (“That must be frustrating for you!”), you can encourage her to find ways to let her parents know that she may be able to handle more than they think she can, and you can do things with her yourself that provide her more opportunities to challenge herself. But the bottom line here is that no matter what a grandparent thinks the right way to be a parent to their grandchild is—short of knowledge of abuse, of course—it’s not their place to say so.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;A 10-year-old girl who'll keep going to the local clinic for the medications to suppress the HIV virus — forgetting that it's now closed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A house painter who no longer has the strength to do his work.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A teenager who finds comfort in religious music as she wonders why it was her fate to be born HIV positive — and how she will find the medications she needs to keep the virus at bay.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These are three of the dozens of HIV positive people in Zambia we interviewed during a trip there this month to see what the impact has been of the Trump Administration's suspension and termination of billions of dollars in global health programs.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Administration officials maintain that certain life saving aid — like HIV medications — has been spared. But people on the ground tell a different story.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR reached out to the Zambian government for comment on the impact of the cuts and to the U.S. State Department as well. Neither responded to our inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR spoke with dozens of HIV-positive people in Zambia to learn the impact on them. They consistently report chaos and confusion — and, increasingly, people falling ill without their HIV medication. Here are some of their stories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;Dorcas and Theresa Mwanza: 'She's a very jovial little girl, but she's been very miserable'&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59786" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                After eight days without taking HIV medications, Dorcas Mwanza, 10, developed a fever and chills, among the first symptoms people experience when they go off HIV treatment.

   &lt;p&gt;"Jovial."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's the word Theresa Mwanza, 32, liked to use to describe her 10-year-old daughter, Dorcas. When Dorcas would get home from school, she'd often play house, pretending to prepare nshima — a thick traditional porridge — for her imaginary family. "I'm thinking she'll be very family-oriented when she grows up," says Theresa in Bemba, a local language spoken in parts of Zambia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When NPR met with the family in early April, it had been eight days since both Dorcas and her mom, Theresa, took the last of their HIV medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A single mom and an only child, they've always taken their medicine together at 8 p.m. each night. The change in routine has confused the little girl.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-60048" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                After the USAID clinic closed, Theresa Mwanza, left, tried to get HIV medications for herself and her daughter, Dorcas, at a government run clinic but was turned away.

            &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"She'll open the tin [where the medicine is kept] and find that it's empty," says Theresa. "She'll run down to the clinic to go and check if she can collect her medication. And then she'll come back home and say, 'Oh, you are right. The clinic is closed. They're not there anymore.' "&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And it seems like their U.S.-funded clinic is not coming back. The doors of the clinic, which services over 2,000 HIV patients, have been locked since the end of January, the staff let go and the furniture largely removed. This clinic didn't just provide medication, it also provided basic food since HIV medicine cannot be taken on an empty stomach. Theresa and Dorcas lost both.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59948" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;So far, without their medication, Theresa feels okay. But Dorcas has developed a fever and chills — and she feels weak. Flu-like symptoms are often one of the first symptoms after someone goes off HIV treatment — the level of virus rises and the body tries to fight it off. Worried, Theresa now stays home to tend to her daughter — who often rests on a mat by the tree outside their home. But it means Theresa isn't going house to house to do laundry and odd jobs, their main source of income.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Theresa tried to get their medications at a clinic run by the Zambian government. It took an hour to walk there only to get turned away. "They keep insisting: 'You need to get direction or guidance from the clinic where you were on where you will go to next,'" she recalls. But with her neighborhood clinic closed, Theresa isn't sure what to do.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59788" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Before medication became available for free with help with the U.S., Theresa Mwanza's two sisters died of AIDS.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;She thinks back to her two sisters who died of AIDS before medication became available — and free with help from the U.S. "I am now really worried," she says looking at her daughter. "She's a very jovial little girl, but she's been very miserable the past few days."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;Mary Mayongana: 'What will become of me?'&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mary Mayongana, 42, typically spends her days either at the market selling vegetables or in a small family compound she shares with her family: Her mother, her four children, her two sisters and their children. "All of us live here as one big family," Mary says, speaking in Bemba.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59881" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                Mary Mayongana, 42, is unsure whether her ankle sore is a result of going off her HIV medications. She says that the pain along with the fatigue she now feels are going to make it hard to walk for 45 minutes to reach the nearest clinic after the closure of the U.S.-funded clinic she had previously used.
                &lt;b class="credit" aria-label="Image credit"&gt;
                    
                    Ben de la Cruz/NPR

                &lt;b class="hide-caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;hide caption&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;span class="credit" aria-label="Image credit"&gt;
        
        Ben de la Cruz/NPR
        
    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Now, Mary is confined to that compound. She's lost access to her HIV treatment and feels weak. She's also developed an itchy &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/01/31/g-s1-45601/trump-pepfar-hiv-positive-antiretroviral-waiver" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;rash&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a classic sign of going off HIV medications — it can be an indication that the body is trying to fight off &lt;a href="https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/hiv-and-rash" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the resurgent virus&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the immune system is weakening. And Mary has another challenge: her ankle is swollen from a painful open sore that continues to spread.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Without warning, her U.S.-funded clinic closed on January 28 with a stop work order from the Trump Administration. Now the clinic's health workers are distributing the remaining supply of medications among all the patients. For more than two months, Mary hasn't been able to consistently take her HIV medication. Sometimes she's gone up to 14 days with no HIV medication at all. Right now, she has a few pills and has decided to take them every third day. It's risky because her body could develop resistance to the drug if it's not taken daily. But, Mary says, it's all she has so she needs her supply to last as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59784" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

        &lt;div class="caption" aria-label="Image caption"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                "I spend a lot of time thinking about what is likely to become of me, especially that I'm actually seeing myself wasting away," says Mary, who for more than two months, hasn't been able to consistently take her HIV medication.

            &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;There are Zambian government clinics that still stock HIV drugs but they've been so overwhelmed by HIV patients from the shuttered U.S.-funded clinics that they've been forced to ration the medication, giving out a limited supply to each patient. And for Mary, who has no money for transportation, the government clinic seems impossibly far away. It's a 45-minute walk on a good day.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She's unsure whether her ankle sore is a result of going off her HIV medications but, she says, the pain and fatigue she feels are going to make it hard to walk to the clinic. She thinks it will take her hours each way. Her mother is urging her to do it anyway — together, she says, they can take a few steps, then rest.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I spend a lot of time thinking about what is likely to become of me, especially that I'm actually seeing myself wasting away," says Mary in a flat, quiet voice. She sits on the cement floor of her brick home, her head resting against the wall. "It's really weighing me down."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-60045" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

He's a house painter and — with the help of HIV medication, which he's taken for 15 years — he always had the strength to do his work. But no longer.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Since early February, when his local U.S.-funded clinic shut down, he's struggled to get his medication. At first, he managed to obtain a few pills here and there but, now, he's out entirely.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sitting on a wooden bench by the window with one of his three children nearby, he says he's lost a lot of weight and feels like all the power has been drained out of him.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59783" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Brian's wife also has HIV and has run out of her medication, too. But, so far, she says she feels fine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The couple went to a nearby government clinic hoping they would be able to get their medications refilled. But, they say, they were told they must bring their medical records in order to register as new patients. So they've been going back to their old clinic to get their files. Every time they go, it's still shuttered. And yet, he says, they have no choice but to keep trying.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We need to wait until there's someone at the &lt;a href="https://www.usaid.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;USAID&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; facility," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59798" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

"I'm going to lose my life, and I will leave my children suffering," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;Catherine Mwaloe: 'I'm a school girl and I don't have money [for HIV medications]'&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When times are hard, Catherine Mwaloe turns to music. She pulls out her phone and scrolls to the emotional, religious songs. Lately, the 16-year-old has been listening to a lot of these songs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59794" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Catherine Mwaloe, 16, who contracted HIV from her mother at birth, has one month's supply of HIV medicine left. She worries that government clinics will charge money for the medications, which were previously free.

   &lt;p&gt;From the two-room house — under a huge mango tree — that she shares with her grandmother, Catherine lets the lyrics of her favorite song, "Nessa's Holy Spirit," wash over her:&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Jesus I need you to survive.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Oh come oh! Holy Spirit come oh"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Her grandmother, who has the same name, says Catherine has been grappling with two questions for which there are no good answers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"She began to ask why she's taking this medication, and then I had to explain to her that 'You're HIV positive,' " says Catherine's grandmother. The girl got the virus from her mother at birth but, her grandmother says, "it's been very difficult to get her to accept her situation. She says, 'What is it that I have done to get this illness?' "&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Holy Spirit come,&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Come and have your way"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lately Catherine's question of "why" has been superseded by the question of "how." How will she get her next round of HIV medications when the health center where she got her free HIV medications was funded by the U.S. and has now shut down. She has one month's supply left and she worries that all the government clinics will charge money for the medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Even if I go there, they [will] say, we should buy medicines. And actually, I'm a school girl and I don't have money. And [my grandmother] just sells some tomatoes so that she can earn money to provide for the food," Catherine says, in a low, flat voice as a tear traces its way down her cheek. "I've heard that there are many millions of people going to die."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59793" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

However, too many of these fit-friendly meals can sometimes lead to long-lasting effects, ones that could even be life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil nuts, hailed for its wealth of antioxidants, essential minerals and nutrients are advised by nutritionists as an important addition to the diet. The star nutrient of the nutrient-dense seeds from the Brazil nut tree is selenium, the mineral that fights inflammation, protects cells from oxidative stress, supports immune function, and is good for thyroid health. Additionally, Brazil nuts also have magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, Thiamine (Vitamin B1), Vitamin E, healthy fats, protein, and fibre. The nutrient-dense superfood is known to lower cholesterol and guard heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so many amazing benefits, it's easier to snack on it way too much than necessary. Eating more Brazil nuts means an increased intake of selenium too, a compound with protective properties in limited amounts, but a potential damaging effect in excess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommended daily intake of selenium is 55 micrograms (mcg) per day, but it may go slightly up for pregnant women (60 mcg) per day and breastfeeding women (70 mcg) per day, according to National Institutes of Health (NIH) – Office of Dietary Supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So what happens when you exceed this daily limit?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many other vitamins and minerals, excess of selenium over a long period of time could lead to selenium toxicity. Also known as selenosis, the condition may lead to garlicky odor in the breath, a metallic taste in the mouth and symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea, tiredness, irritability, and joint pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some other signs include loss of mentation (mental activity) , tingling or numbness, hyperreflexia (overactive reflexes), brittle or deformed nails, alopecia (hair loss), discoloration and loss of teeth, as well as skin rashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acute toxicity can lead to heart attack, kidney failure, vascular symptoms such as tachycardia (faster heart rate than normal) and flushing of the face, tremors, irritability, and myalgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can too much of selenium lead to cancer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While selenium is known to protect against cancer, having excess amounts can do the opposite - it can raise risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2018 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6491296/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; called Selenium for Preventing Cancer analysed data from 10 studies involving over 27,000 people. It was found there was no evidence that selenium supplements decrease cancer incidence. In fact, it raised the risk of prostate cancer and type 2 diabetes in people taking a selenium supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The correct way to eat Brazil nuts&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limit your intake to 1-2 nuts per day. This amount is enough to meet your daily selenium requirement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add 1 nut into a morning smoothie for a creamy texture and a selenium boost.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chop and sprinkle on salads or yogurt. Combine 1–2 Brazil nuts with other nuts, seeds, and dried fruit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Selenium and Vitamin E work synergistically to fight oxidative stress. Add Brazil nuts to a spinach or avocado recipe for maximum benefits. &lt;p data-type="video" data-msid="115669038" data-hostid="83" data-title="How Lifestyle Choices Can Increase Your Risk of Stomach Cancer" data-thumburl="https://denmark.timesinternet.in/cmslite/api/app/images.jpg?msid=115669038&amp;amp;hostid=83"&gt;&lt;msid&gt;115669038&lt;/msid&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 11:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_AFBVV95cUxNei1Sdld4M2p6VW1sM1l6djhQZm1nX2FqRUEzUnFOWHVlSWVQMlBqUjNtWGE1LUdmdExkZU5NTWxrckk4ZlRRaEdEbGViQm80SnVwaEtOSEFWRnlZZFp3ZkNwRUdlbWJWc0JlLTNkOE91T2dqdHMzRmpxQzM2aUctUkFWZ2QwWTZSTmk2aGUteDlISmNsc0hlS093NllvY1RiS1FSOEUxc2N2Z05SeHRscHl1b2tEak9aMzZodUhCUHR4WGRaWWFRMEtOQ0xLbEJaUi1iVzJrX19BNGE0dG1BNW50YjBGT1dGNGc0NjhaQ2RweWJ3NXgyeG9pb2w</guid></item><item><title>研究人员在发现日常产品中存在“隐形”威胁后发出紧急警告： “要求我们立即采取行动” -雅虎 | Researchers issue urgent warning after discovering 'invisible' threat in everyday products: 'Requires us to act now' - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxQRTVSUDNTaldCUlk5Y0NhVXhaUjd2MnY2YmluT0JTV3YyQ2NvLUFDNndaX0NIb0hpanNIRDI5OEFwNmlTRGM1QXp0eG05N3gtS3V0UXRSQ00wbHNNSG1PVTQ0VDBNUG1LVDFmVDdVUTItWkZXb1pTd1FTbG00RXZvRmljS2VZaDZCc05Zalpxbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The health risks associated with microplastics have been known for years. However, researchers are now learning that it doesn't take much for microplastic particles to make their way into our food and water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A growing number of scientists have noted that microplastics have the ability to easily shed into food and water without much effort. While many people might assume that overuse is the main concern in microplastic exposure, the truth is that these microscopic plastic particles may end up in your food after just one use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Victoria Fulfer, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Rhode Island, said the prevalence of plastic use in food packaging only amplifies the concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Mostly, when a container says 'microwave safe,' it means it's safe for the container to be in the microwave, it's not going to melt," Fulfer &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/doesnt-take-much-microplastics-leach-food-researchers-warn-rcna198975" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:told;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; NBC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"But that doesn't mean that it's safe for you as a person, because microwaving plastic particularly changes the chemical bonds," Fulfer added. "They make them more weak."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is microplastic exposure important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director of the Grossman Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards at New York University, explained that microplastic exposure can lead to an array of severe health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"We're talking about cardiovascular mortality," Trasande &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/doesnt-take-much-microplastics-leach-food-researchers-warn-rcna198975" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:told;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; NBC News. "We're also talking about hormone-sensitive cancers. Breast, thyroid, ovarian, not to mention kidney cancer, that have been associated with these chemical exposures."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Despite the &lt;a href="https://magazine.hms.harvard.edu/articles/microplastics-everywhere" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:increasing health risk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;increasing health risk&lt;/a&gt; that comes along with microplastic exposure, scientists note that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10151227/#:~:text=In%20vitro%20experiments%20with%20human,gut%20microbiota%20dysbiosis%2C%20and%20neurotoxicity." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:more research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;more research&lt;/a&gt; needs to be done to determine the extent of the possible damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about reducing microplastic use?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352396424004584#sec4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from Trasande, there are ways that we may be able to address this growing concern. "Preventing plastic exposure is very much possible," Trasande &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352396424004584#sec4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:wrote;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The researcher suggested that by including color-based additives to chemicals in plastic creation, we can help visualize the abundance of plastic in our everyday lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Looking to the next ten years ahead, biomonitoring initiatives are needed to visualise this issue, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries," Trasande added. "The technology to measure [micro- and nanoplastics] will eventually advance and make concerns even more apparent, but the threat of the invisible requires us to act now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the meantime, legislators have worked to progress measures to minimize the production of single-use plastics. In 2023, Senator Jeff Merkley introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3127/text" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act of 2023;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act of 2023&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to "prevent pollution from consumer products and packaging from entering into animal and human food chains and waterways, and for other purposes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2019, 170 countries pledged to &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-47592111" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:significantly reduce;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;significantly reduce&lt;/a&gt; the use of plastics by 2030.

Additionally,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the autism diagnostic tools used today were developed exclusively on white boys from high socioeconomic status, said &lt;a href="https://www.stephaniegardnerwright.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Stephanie Gardner-Wright" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68013c24e4b0b87197a6e18d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.stephaniegardnerwright.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Stephanie Gardner-Wright&lt;/a&gt;, a licensed master social worker and certified autism clinical specialist in Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a huge focus on the external signs and not so much the internal symptoms of autism, Gardner-Wright said. And those internal symptoms are very different from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There are so many ways that autism can show up and present,” Neff added. “I think there’s more diversity within autism than there is between autism and allistic.” (Allistic people are folks who aren’t on the autism spectrum.) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That said, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;there are a number of signs or thought patterns that undiagnosed autistic people may be able to relate to. &lt;/span&gt;HuffPost spoke with mental health professionals, including some people who are neurodivergent themselves, about the signs of autism in adulthood:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Feeling Of Being ‘Different’ From Others&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;All four experts shared that it’s common for autistic people to feel different. &lt;a href="https://effectiveartistry.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Brandon Tessers" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68013c24e4b0b87197a6e18d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://effectiveartistry.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Brandon Tessers&lt;/a&gt;, the director of Effective Artistry, a therapy group that supports neurodivergent people, said some folks will describe it as “&lt;span&gt;feeling like an alien sometimes,” while &lt;a href="https://gsapp.rutgers.edu/faculty/vanessa-bal" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Vanessa Bal" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68013c24e4b0b87197a6e18d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://gsapp.rutgers.edu/faculty/vanessa-bal" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Dr. Vanessa Bal&lt;/a&gt;, the director of the Center for Adult Autism Services Psychological Services Clinic at Rutgers University in New Jersey said folks describe it as “a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;lifetime experience of feeling different.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The difference between this feeling and the occasional outsider feeling everyone deals with from time to time is that for autistic folks, this feeling does not come and go and is not only during one specific period, like middle school, Bal told HuffPost.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gardner-Wright added that this is a big indicator and an internal experience at that — you cannot look at a person and know if they feel like an outsider. The feeling could be overpowering or could be more subtle, it depends on the person, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, it’s important to know that autistic people don’t necessarily feel like outsiders all the time, Bal noted. They may find settings that are more inclusive for neurodivergent people. Additionally, some adults also say they feel more comfortable with who they are and worry less about differences, sometimes seeing them as strengths, as they get older, Bal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulty With Social Cues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social cues are also another sign. Someone with undiagnosed autism may find they have trouble deciphering how much eye contact is appropriate or when they should stop smiling during a conversation, Gardner-Wright said. They may be able to mask these uncertainties by learning how much is appropriate, but it’s not an innate sense as it is with someone who is allistic, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Confusing Relationship History — Both Romantically Or Platonically&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Neff, many undiagnosed autistic adults have a confusing and complicated social relationship history. Additionally, romantic relationships may feel tough to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There might be relationships that have that kind of suddenly burst apart but the autistic person doesn’t understand why,” she said. When it comes to the reason behind this complicated relationship history, it’s likely that the person with autism doesn’t know why their relationships fail when other people’s don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensory Differences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sensitivity to sensory input — like noise and sight — is another potential sign of autism, said Gardner-Wright, who added that this can mean being hyper-aware of a sound or totally unaware.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are not autistic tend to be more or less responsive to sensory stimuli, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, an autistic person may find that they’re constantly aware of a ticking clock at a friend’s house or really sensitive to the sound of a loud siren, Gardner-Wright noted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Desire For Routine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people with autism thrive on consistency. “&lt;span&gt;The world we occupy is much more uncertain and unpredict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;able. So we go to routine as a way of self-soothing,” Neff said. &lt;/span&gt;When a routine is disrupted, strong emotions may present, including intense irritability or anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gardner-Wright added that the routine doesn’t need to be super strict, either; it’s a common misconception when people think about people with autism’s day-to-day schedule. Instead, it could be a strong preference for a certain mug every morning. Routine looks different for different people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, big changes can be hard, too. “If &lt;span&gt;they move [homes] or they move careers, this could create a season of insomnia or anxiety,” Neff said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Routine can extend to certain behaviors as well. It also includes repetitive body movements, which is known as stimming, Neff added. &lt;a href="https://www.research.chop.edu/car-autism-roadmap/stimming-what-is-it-and-does-it-matter#:~:text=%22%20Stimming%20%2C%22%20also%20known%20as,spectrum%20engage%20in%20routine%20stimming%20." target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="According to the Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania’s Research Institute" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68013c24e4b0b87197a6e18d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.research.chop.edu/car-autism-roadmap/stimming-what-is-it-and-does-it-matter#:~:text=%22%20Stimming%20%2C%22%20also%20known%20as,spectrum%20engage%20in%20routine%20stimming%20." data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;According to the Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania’s Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;, stimming behaviors can include body rocking, hand flapping, spinning, rubbing a specific surface and squealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Need For Solitude &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another common sign? “Needing solitude &lt;span&gt;to recharge after social situations or really overstimulating situations — and overstimulating could be different for everyone — but that is a very typical hallmark of [autism],” Gardner-Wright said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This could mean feeling totally exhausted after a work presentation or a family party.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bal said this exhaustion comes from a term known as “camouflaging” or “masking.” “This is the idea that you have to really hide different facets of yourself or different behaviors in order to fit in what you think the expectations around you are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while we all do this at times, the degree that autistic people have to camouflage aspects of themselves may result&lt;s&gt;s&lt;/s&gt; in a feeling of total drainage where afterward they report spending long periods of time alone or in dark and quiet places to recover, Bal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tessers added that, from the outside, people have no idea when someone is camouflaging. “T&lt;span&gt;hey’re doing what everybody wants or expects of them to some successful degree.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This could look like behaving as you “should” at work but going home and crashing and dreading the idea of having to do this camouflaging all over again tomorrow, Tessers noted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Jordan Siemens via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jordan Siemens via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;It's not uncommon for an adult with autism to need time alone after days filled with social commitments.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Intense Interests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A deep curiosity and passion for one particular &lt;span&gt;activity&lt;/span&gt; or subject can also develop. “Our brains tend to gravitate with a lot of passion towards our area of interest and we become very invested in them and it’s also a way we self-soothe,” Neff said. &lt;/span&gt;This could mean building a career around a specific interest or knowing everything about a specific hobby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while everyone has interests — and many people have strong interests — Neff said autistic folks likely find a way to relate everything to their specific interest. For example, this could look like finding a way to talk about a favorite TV show even when the conversation revolves around current events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Allistic people can have a special interest but then it doesn’t become their lens for their whole world,” Neff said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Dislike Of Small Talk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t love small talk, but for people with autism, small talk can feel totally exhausting or something that shouldn’t have to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“They typically don’t enjoy small talk and perhaps found ways to avoid it,” Neff said. “Maybe they structured their life or their career in a way that they don’t have to do a lot of that allistic communication.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gardner-Wright added that people who are on the spectrum tend to prefer deep, meaningful conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Desire For Direct Communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People with autism thrive on straightforwardness, with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; “really honest, clear communication being a strong preference,” Gardner-Wright said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neff said autistic people tend to be pretty literal. For example, when you say the phrase “it’s raining cats and dogs,” she said autistic people may picture literal cats and dogs falling from the sky in their mind, but then realize the person speaking is referring to rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“So, actually, I think it’s perhaps more precise to say we’re visual in our communication style versus literal, but it often shows up as being literal,” Neff said. &lt;/span&gt;Additionally, the communication style can be described as direct and honest. “W&lt;span&gt;hat we say, we tend to say at face value,” Neff added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you think you have these signs, look to autistic voices for guidance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Gardner-Wright and Neff recommend exploring the hashtag&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/actuallyautistic/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" #actuallyautistic" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68013c24e4b0b87197a6e18d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/actuallyautistic/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt; #actuallyautistic&lt;/a&gt; on social media to listen to lived experiences and hear from people in your specific community about how this exists for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Discovering that you’re autistic as an adult can be really validating,” Gardner-Wright said. It can help you more fully understand yourself and your life. “But there can also be a grieving process for that,” she said, where you may wish you had this information when you were a kid so certain situations could have been different.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Feeling a mix of grief and also excitement is very, very normal,” Gardner-Wright said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;a href="https://embrace-autism.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="embrace-autism.com" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68013c24e4b0b87197a6e18d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://embrace-autism.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;embrace-autism.com&lt;/a&gt; is a helpful resource for free screening tools and tests to help you understand if you are autistic — though it is not diagnostic, they’re simply online guides to help arm you with information, Gardner-Wright noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can reach out to mental health professionals, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neff said it can be helpful to connect with a therapist to talk about this new discovery, but she stressed that it’s important to find one who is neurodivergent-affirming or -informed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bal agreed and said “we have a long way to go with respect to training medical professionals and mental health professionals about autism. I worry there’s a lot of misinformation and misconceptions out there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bal added that you can also look up autism centers near you for diagnosis or treatment, but noted that many have a yearslong waitlist and may focus only on children. If they can’t fit you in, Bal said, you can ask if they have resources they recommend, or look for community autism organizations to see if they have any resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fewer than 10% of U.S. adults get the 28 to 34 grams of fiber we need each day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oatmeal is a great start, but there are fruits with even more fiber than oatmeal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These include avocados, blackberries, raspberries, pears and pomegranates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Almost all of us could use more &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;. Even though we’re supposed to consume 28 to 34 grams of fiber a day, fewer than 1 in 10 of us actually do it (yikes!).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That doesn’t just spell trouble for our digestive health. Fiber also helps protect against weight gain and can help reduce the risk of a long list of chronic illnesses, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, whole grains like oatmeal can help. For instance, a half-cup of dry oats provides 4 grams of fiber. But did you know that some fruits contain even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; fiber than a bowl of oatmeal?&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, fruit is jammed with vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. If you’re wondering how much fruit you should eat, the USDA recommends roughly 2 cups per day for women and 2½ cups for men (if you’re a fan of dried fruit, ½ cup of dried fruit equals 1 cup of fresh).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, keep eating that oatmeal. But load your shopping cart with these fiber-rich fruits, too!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-avocados"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Avocados &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 avocado = 10 grams fiber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may think of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026117/avocados-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;avocados&lt;/a&gt; as a vegetable, but they’re actually a fruit. Green silky avocados are so versatile and delicious that you can use them in almost all kinds of recipes, from salads to smoothies to guacamole and more. No wonder they’re so popular! Between 2000 and 2020, global avocado consumption tripled from 6 billion pounds to 18 billion pounds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Healthwise, avocados may be best known for their heart-friendly fats. But their fiber may be equally as important for your health, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, research reveals avocados’ fiber may encourage the growth of good gut bacteria. This, in turn, may lead to the production of compounds called short-chain fatty acids that nourish your gut and protect it from inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-blackberries"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Blackberries &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 cup =  8 grams fiber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; All berries are loaded with fiber, but blackberries are off the charts. That’s not the only reason to love them, though. Blackberries are also chock-full of nutrients and health-promoting compounds, including antioxidants such as anthocyanins, ellagitannins, flavonols and flavanols.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These powerful compounds help disable disease-causing free radicals linked to illnesses like heart disease and cancer. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, blackberries’ ample vitamin C (roughly a third of your daily requirement per cup) provides even more antioxidant action. Blackberries’ vitamin C also happens to enhance iron absorption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  So, adding a giant handful of blackberries to your oatmeal can help you soak up more of its iron and give you a fiber bump in the process. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-raspberries"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Raspberries &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 cup = 8 grams fiber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like blackberries,&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7835832/health-benefits-of-raspberries/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; raspberries&lt;/a&gt; are among the highest-fiber fruits. They’re also loaded with protective anthocyanins, flavanols, flavonols and ellagitannins. Combined, these may have potent disease-preventing properties. Consider the findings of one study that focused on the impact of raspberry consumption on diabetes and prediabetes. Researchers concluded that eating 1 to 1½ cups of raspberries daily may have beneficial effects on blood glucose, insulin and cholesterol in people at risk for chronic disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-pears"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Pears &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 medium pear = 6 grams fiber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Apples may be a quick, convenient, grab-on-the-go fruit. But don’t forget about &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292095/4-surprising-health-benefits-of-pears/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pears&lt;/a&gt;. One pear delivers roughly 20% of the Daily Value for fiber. That’s 30% more than the roughly 4 grams of fiber in the average apple.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  And if constipation is an issue, pears can provide a natural solution. These sweet, juicy fruits are rich in sorbitol, a sugar alcohol that has a natural laxative effect.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-pomegranates"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Pomegranates &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 cup pomegranate = 7 grams fiber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These juicy, ruby-red fruits may resemble apples from the outside, but they’re actually giant berries. While their thick, inedible skin is a no-go, their fleshy arils (which are botanically considered a whole grain, by the way) are packed with fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Like their berry cousins, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7882893/health-benefits-of-pomegranates/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pomegranates&lt;/a&gt; are nutrition powerhouses. They’re rich in phytochemicals, including anthocyanins, tannins and flavonoids, which have been shown to exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties and protect against heart disease. Research also reveals pomegranates contain compounds called polyphenols that help promote the growth of healthy gut bacteria, so they’re a win for gut health, too.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As healthy and tasty as pomegranates are, peeling them can be tricky! But don’t let that stop you.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber has many health benefits, from keeping you full and satisfied to stabilizing blood sugar levels to lowering cholesterol and more. Of course, whole grains like oatmeal are a great way to score more of this under-consumed nutrient. However, some fruits contain even more fiber than a bowl of oatmeal, especially avocados, blackberries, raspberries and pomegranates. So, head to the produce section and load up.

    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the reason for these changes is that, as people get closer to the age that “old” starts, they want to keep pushing it down the road? “True, but being ‘old’ isn’t only to do with how many years you’ve been alive, it also depends on your health,” he says. “If you’ve had a stroke or &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/gardened-my-way-through-grief-then-cancer-struck/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, or have &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/dementia/midlife-medications-dementia/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; or are otherwise immobile, you will feel older.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clough thinks that old age is “often a case of self-definition. At 82, I would define myself as old,” he says. “Maybe I became old when we moved to a retirement village seven years ago, or when I was diagnosed with &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/prostate-cancer-what-you-should-know/"&gt;prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt;.” And yet he hasn’t said goodbye to youth without a struggle. “If someone tells me I look younger  as happened at the barber’s the other day – I’m still flattered, despite the fact my age gets me a cheaper haircut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Then I ask myself: why should I get pleasure at being told I look younger? Why don’t we look at older people as beautiful, as we do with trees? Look at my wizened old hands here, and compare them with the bark of a tree. Why is one beautiful, and not the other?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Learning to manage frailty&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clough looks after himself: on a swift walk around the Peaks near his home, he leaves this writer panting to keep up. “I do this walk four times a week, go to the gym, and I play tennis when my back allows, though my children are always begging me not to go for the tricky drop shots,” he says. “But I recognise that I am not what I was. If you ask someone my age ‘how are you?’ you know you are going to get a long response.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is, he agrees, humour in the sound of a bunch of older people sitting around discussing their ailments and medications. “But it’s also quite interesting,” he notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps old age begins when, if we take a tumble, we go from the action being termed “&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/ageing/how-to-fall-over-safely/"&gt;having a fall&lt;/a&gt;”, rather than merely “falling over”, which is what young people do. “Yes, there is definitely a difference here,” he says. “‘Having a fall’ feels like something is being done to you; I am out of control of my body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know I am frail,” he continues. “I’m vulnerable and not as stable as I used to be. I know that when I’m out walking I need, as Ann keeps reminding me, to ‘keep away from the edge’. I’m learning to take more care, because one false step could immobilise me. I’m trying to keep a foothold; it’s a bit of an analogy for my life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wants to try the Three Peaks Challenge again. “But I will be kind to myself if I don’t complete it,” he adds. “I’d love to go over old ground, but if it’s not to be, it’s not to be. I wouldn’t be a failure. I won’t berate myself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Accept your memory is failing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However much we want to stress the ability and wisdom of older people, there is a hinterland of diminishing competence,” says Clough. He tells a story of trying to make himself a &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/health-benefits-black-coffee/"&gt;cup of coffee&lt;/a&gt;, filling the cafetière with boiling water, but omitting the granules. “I’m sitting there with a cup of hot water, thinking: do I tell Ann?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clough then relates a recent incident where he was having trouble reversing his car in a tight spot, and was happy for his son to take over. He compares this with earlier competence, driving his family in a rickety truck in Namibia. “I’m now aware of my uncertainty, after a lifetime beavering away over decision-making,” he says. “These days I want my children to decide things for me (at least, I think I do).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The only thing I have learnt is that I have to accept this is how it is,” he continues. He and his friends laugh about their loss of executive function: “But &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/mental-health/health-benefits-laughter/"&gt;the laughter&lt;/a&gt; is uncertain because it could be early stage dementia. Laughter is a way of dealing with anxiety and fear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Learning from his father’s old age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the last few years of his life, Clough’s father went to live in a care home. “In the home, he became very secluded,” Clough remembers. “Dad was a Methodist minister, he was used to holding court. He would just about go down to meals, but I was surprised about how much he stayed in his room: he never went into the garden, or onto walks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, Clough tried to encourage his father out of his shell, but then he changed his mind. “Maybe we are imposing a pattern on older people that isn’t naturally there,” he says. “I gradually realised my father was finding a way to come to terms with himself. By this stage, he has already been living without my mother for 14 or 15 years. After he died, I found notes in his bible, about his favourite hymns, TV programmes and articles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe my father wanted to use these final months to talk to himself and reflect – to know what was important to him, not other people – and to move towards it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Are we trying too hard to stay ‘young’? Maybe it’s time for acceptance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a strong move in society to almost think we can get away without ageing as long as we eat the right food, take the right supplements, go to the gym, and just keep going,” says Clough. He sees this as a new kind of ageism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t accept a stage of life where our body is going to be different,” he says. “You think this gung-ho lifestyle will keep you going, but what happens when you have a heart attack? It’s really important how you come to terms with this life-stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, instead, you can make the decision to use this time to ‘come home’, to live and let go, and to know you aren’t going to be around forever.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clough feels the writing of &lt;em&gt;Oldenland &lt;/em&gt;has helped prepare him to carve out and create the last period of his life. “Ageing is an important time of life for living, not necessarily ‘doing’ or ‘accomplishing’ or going around the world,” he says. “It’s not about ‘success’. It’s a time to live to the full with who and what I am, alongside the realisation I am not going to go on forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Old age isn’t just about problems with your bladder or your bowels or your hearing – it can be a time to really &lt;em&gt;live.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oldenland: A Journey in Search of the Good Last Years&lt;/em&gt; by Roger Clough is published on 24 April 2025&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;There has been so much controversy on the use of GLP-1 medication to aid in shedding those pounds, and this is not the first time that warnings have come out about using the drug for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/ozempic"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; has been furthering a lot of people's weight loss results, even thought it was originally created to help manage Type 2 Diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;One of the main reasons Ozempic has become such a big deal in the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; sector is the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/celebrity"&gt;famous celebs&lt;/a&gt; who have been taking it and revealing their slimmer bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/celebrity/news/oprah-winfrey-ozempic-thin-people-comment-479544-20250123"&gt;Oprah Winfrey&lt;/a&gt;, Sharon Osbourne, &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/celebrity/news/amy-schumer-mounjaro-funny-video-211223-20250413"&gt;Amy Schumer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/celebrity/news/rebel-wilson-ozempic-weight-loss-memoir-656231-20240401"&gt;Rebel Wilson&lt;/a&gt; have all admitted to using a GLP-1 drug, be it to lose or maintain their weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;The grim reality of Ozempic has been posted (YouTube/@zackdfilms)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However, as Ozempic hasn't been approved by the FDA for weight loss, it could be a risk to take it for any other use other than its intended purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Semaglutide, which can help to regulate your appetite, however, is approved for weight loss under the Wegovy brand name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;While we’ve all seen the results about how the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/drugs"&gt;drug&lt;/a&gt; works, many still don’t know how it actually helps people to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Thankfully, a YouTuber by the handle @ZackDFilms has come to the rescue and revealed the grim realities of what Ozempic does once it hits your system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;In the clip, you can see everything that happens, from how it changes your brain, to the inner workings of your organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Plus, it also shows some pesky side effects which might make you feel a little icky afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;He states: “Once Ozempic is in your bloodstream, it activates the part of the brain that make you feel full, reducing your appetite.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;From there, it’ll stabilize ‘your blood sugar’ to curb those nagging food cravings you might have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Now, this all sounds great, and while he also shares that it stops your stomach from emptying as fast so that you feel fuller for longer, this part of the drug symptom could then in turn make you feel sick and even produce diarrhea in some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;People who watched the video were equally horrified and interested in how Ozempic could do this to your body, reducing weight and supressing hunger in users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However, there are more side effects that could present themselves for some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Dr Ben Bickman, a &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/science"&gt;scientist&lt;/a&gt; and professor at Brigham Young University in Utah, stated that even muscle loss can be brought on after using the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"You have a substantial amount of lean mass that's getting loss as the person is losing weight. To make that clear, for every ten pounds of weight loss, only six is fat - four of it is coming from non-fat sources like muscle and bone," he told Thomas DeLauer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Dr Bickman added: "While muscle and bone mass might never return, the body has no trouble regaining fat mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"What's more, one study found that one version of these drugs, actually stimulates the production of new fat cells."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;He continued: "This becomes a problem because when a person start to regain fat mass after stopping Ozempic, with more fat cells comes a greater potential to gain more fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"As a result, even though a person may still weight less than they did before starting the drug, they may be fatter, with a higher percentage of body fat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>UNILAD</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 10:52:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNSm1FWDhBcER2TlNON2E4SkpBdUJ2MGRKbFIwNm9RcVVGOE9kbGVpZmpLUjFZS2NQVXVUVHpoanFFQ1Q4WVR2Z0JwbFpfdks4bEpxV3ZTWHRJNWFQYVY1NnRUWHJBQmRwTGg0d0t1MmI0Ujk3RHgzYXg0Y3JDT2FHMzhFX21IV1JOaURwcjhEMzRIZzZUdXc</guid></item><item><title>研究揭示了男性每月应射精多少次以帮助预防前列腺癌- UNILAD | Study reveals how many times a man should ejaculate per month to help prevent prostate cancer - UNILAD</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxNWHA4N3NMamFzUXpjd1VDMl9tTV96RnVTSGRrMjhKRzJ4Q0lXOWVyZEJLeG5RSmNpMERBOUQ4SWl3Q2tYRHJsaFJ6V21TN2gtTXM3c3JYZDl6ZjlNeTVjYkNYWUgzeGRPZV9VRENaaHJManNKbEdhdmdEOTBjeU1VdW52cjI0OE5TNkRoeERFM2pnY0ZJWjFQUUtPa3BIb25D?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A study looking into a link between orgasms and the development of prostate cancer has revealed how many times a man should ejaculate per month to prevent the disease.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The American Cancer Society states that one in eight men will be diagnosed with prostate &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/cancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;

The majority of cases are in West Texas, where an outbreak that shows no signs of abating began in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Nearly all of the cases are among people who haven’t been vaccinated, but 3% of the identified cases are so-called &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;breakthrough infections.&lt;/a&gt; People got sick despite being either partially or fully vaccinated with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Infectious diseases doctors are at pains to emphasize that the MMR vaccine is one of the most effective vaccines on the market, but as Rodney Rohde, a professor at Texas State University explains, a small number of people who are fully vaccinated may get sick during a large outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;One dose of the MMR vaccine is 93% effective at preventing measles, with the second dose increasing that to 97%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The vaccine is highly effective,” said Rohde. “But it means that after two doses, while 97 out of 100 people will develop strong immunity and be protected if exposed to measles, the remaining three out of 100 could still be vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The latest outbreak has seen claims circulating on social media from people who say they are fully vaccinated and still contracted a breakthrough infection, making them seriously unwell, something Rohde said is “slightly possible.” “They could fall into one of those small percentages that got the full vaccine but just didn’t respond,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, he said, it’s also plausible that those people may not have realized they weren’t fully vaccinated against measles. &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/80/3/663/7756619" target="_blank"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that when breakthrough infections occur, the MMR vaccine still tends to provide some partial protection. “If someone vaccinated does get measles, it’s often a milder version, sometimes called modified measles,” says Rohde. “A rash can still occur, but it may be less widespread [across the body], fainter or atypical, meaning it doesn’t follow the classic pattern of starting at the hairline and spreading downwards. Fever is also less common or lower-grade. In classic measles, fevers can spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, but in modified cases, it’s often milder or absent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;According to Rohde, the same is true for other common measles symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conjunctivitis, or red eyes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They may still occur, but are often less intense,” he says. “Koplik spots, which are tiny white spots in the mouth, are less commonly seen. Breakthrough cases are also generally less contagious, but still a potential source of transmission.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;People are contagious four days before and four days after the rash begins, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services. &lt;/a&gt;The rash usually appears 14 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Rohde also suggests that people experiencing severe symptoms from a breakthrough infection may have just had a single vaccine dose, which still offers significant protection, but not quite as much as the full two-dose regimen. “These cases can be closer to classic measles than in two-dose breakthroughs, with a high fever which may last longer,” he says. “The rash is usually a more typical measles rash and can be more extensive than in fully vaccinated breakthrough cases. They are also more likely to get possible complications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There’s still the question of why these infections happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;As Rohde and others explain, there may be a number of reasons, ranging from the timing of vaccination to genetic variability in the immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measles vaccine immunity is mostly stable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has called for the public to get vaccinated against measles, he also claimed in an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2U0csKvqMY" target="_blank"&gt;interview with CBS News&lt;/a&gt; that “&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/health-secretary-rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-falsely-claims-wanes-rcna200636" target="_blank"&gt;the vaccine wanes very quickly.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Vaccine experts counter that the MMR shots offer lifelong protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“If immunity waned a lot, you would see a lot of cases in vaccinated people in older age groups, and we’re not seeing that in this Texas outbreak or any others in the recent past,” said Scott Weaver, a microbiology and immunology professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch, who also works with the Global Virus Network coalition of experts. “People seem to be solidly protected, and almost everybody for life, as far as we can tell.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Unlike influenza or Covid, measles is a very stable virus that has evolved little to evade vaccine-induced immunity over time. In 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(21)00041-0" target="_blank"&gt;Mayo Clinic researchers&lt;/a&gt; published a study concluding that there’s a near-zero probability of a novel measles virus naturally emerging with the capability of circumventing the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While the virus isn’t changing, it appears that in some rare cases, the body’s own immune system can slowly stop producing antibodies against the virus. Based on international studies, scientists have concluded that it is possible for some children &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31184979/" target="_blank"&gt;vaccinated against measles&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35927136/" target="_blank"&gt;lose their protection &lt;/a&gt;over the course of two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Because measles is highly infectious, this waning is expected to cause some breakthrough infections,” said Alexis Robert, a researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who authored a paper on &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(24)00181-6/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;long-term vaccine protection&lt;/a&gt; in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;All people respond to either vaccines or natural infections a little bit differently, according to Weaver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The MMR vaccine, which works by presenting the immune system with a live but weakened version of the measles virus, trains the body’s immune cells to recognize different parts of the virus’ proteins called epitopes and generate antibodies against them in the future, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;An epitope refers to small segments of amino acids on a protein’s structure that the immune system’s antibodies learn to recognize and bind to, should the virus attempt to invade again in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It’s not unexpected that a few people respond poorly to any vaccine, Weaver said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Some people have a very robust response because they respond to many different [viral] epitopes, and some people, just by chance, have immune cells that can’t recognize as many of those epitopes,” he said. “Differences in our genetic makeup determine how many different epitopes we respond to and develop immune memory against.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ousted-fda-vaccine-chief-us-measles-elimination-status-threat-rcna199966" target="_blank"&gt;measles was declared eliminated in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; in 2000 and no longer considered a public health threat, research into the virus slowed. With vaccine hesitancy rising and the U.S. close to losing its measles elimination status, some scientists see the need to study and monitor the rare cases of breakthrough infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“While transmission patterns show measles outbreaks are driven by groups of unvaccinated individuals, especially among children, a potential risk of infection years after vaccination still impacts what strategy is most effective and the coverage needed to eradicate measles,” Robert said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How quickly does the measles vaccine take effect?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Timing can also make a difference. A child who had just received the MMR vaccine will still be vulnerable to measles within the first couple of weeks, especially during an intense outbreak where a lot of virus is circulating, Rohde said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“In most cases, the human immune system takes roughly two weeks to develop enough protection against the measles virus and many other pathogens,” he said. “If you were exposed just before or after getting the vaccine, your body may not be at full strength.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In some cases, for example people who are either born with a weakened immune system or develop conditions such as autoimmune diseases or blood cancers, the body may not mount as effective an immune response against measles, resulting in breakthrough infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There are people who just have an overall immune system that’s just not as effective against many different infectious agents,” Weaver said. “We know about people who are immune compromised for certain reasons, like they’re HIV-infected, they’re under chemotherapy for cancer, things like that, but there are some people who are just born with immune systems that don’t function quite as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Another plausible explanation is that people may have received a defective MMR vaccine, although Weaver said this is unlikely in the United States, where quality controls tend to be fairly stringent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“In the cases of measles, it’s a live virus, so that virus could become less infectious if it’s not stored properly and that could lead to less [immune] response,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;When you might need a measles booster&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Whether you’re more vulnerable to developing a breakthrough measles infection could also depend on when you were born. Before the first measles vaccines were developed in the 1960s, virtually everyone contracted the virus during childhood, providing those who survived with lifelong immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, people who were born between 1957 and 1968 received a first-generation measles vaccine made using an inactivated virus that did not work so well. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that anyone born within this time frame should get at least one MMR dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Between 1968 and 1989, most people received only a single MMR dose, making them slightly less well protected compared with people who got the standard two doses in the past 36 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, suggested that if someone who got only a single dose is near a current measles outbreak or is traveling internationally to a country where the virus is endemic, it could be worth checking with with a doctor about getting another dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Even if you’re truly immune and you get another dose of MMR, there’s no harm to that,” Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxPeGpRZnY2Zjd4ZWJKLXR1dHJSbnVWTEp2UVptNE1zYWIxQkotR3ZPcURVbFRMd3o1dVF0RXN3emM4YnRpVWtDSXE0YmZMWm9wQTlqREhjU0pXZUVaTkg1T0Fyb1RmbVB0ZHh2a0JsY1pjRFJ3TEFBcXpYdEtsLV9GUG5wUU5MbWlEbnZPZjRmWlFxQlFQTjlvVmtqQzkzN3A1V2JYdmR2c3dvMV9PcHfSAVZBVV95cUxPSlVhS0o2MHNsQzJnMllKMWZoeVJuT1cwVy1kWEwxU241VW1vZ01vbFpqWjRDQkxSQlo3Z3l3b3JPV2lpRV96T1hQX3RqOEd0dTBoTllkdw</guid></item><item><title>根据最新研究-食品和葡萄酒，为什么你应该多吃生姜 | Why You Should Be Eating More Ginger, According to New Research - Food &amp; Wine</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE9CdU41ckZwTmt4aC1rSF9wcW1Bb08yWm5PbFcxYXNVUFcwdlRITUQ3QmFDOWY3YUl1ZmRyT3g2bE10LTFLdEJ4MmN4ZlZiZGw1ek1WaldIR1Y3Tm9leXNrTE9jUU9pNWlZSy1RNlFyWHV0U19XQ3RLdUVHckg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-generic" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading"&gt;Key Points&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study published in medical journal &lt;em&gt;Cureus&lt;/em&gt; reveals numerous health benefits ginger can provide, including its ability to lower blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The many health benefits of ginger led researchers to conclude that the ingredient is a viable tool for assisting in treatment of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ginger can also aid in digestion, boost immunity, and reduce inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ginger is a welcome addition to many recipes. It’s aromatic, spicy, and carries a hint of earthy, citrusy flavor. But aside from its zesty taste, recent research published in medical journal &lt;a href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/335712-ginger-a-nutraceutical-supplement-for-protection-against-various-cardiovascular-diseases-in-clinical-trials#!/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cureus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; discovered that the flowering spice is a natural way to reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The 2025 study analyzed the potential health benefits of ginger in cardiology, with a focus on how it can impact diabetes, high blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. Beyond this, the review also investigated the health benefits of gingerol and shogaol, two phytochemicals — naturally occurring chemicals in plants — found in &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/cooking-with-ginger-8625087" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;ginger&lt;/a&gt; that are responsible for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to the report, ginger contains numerous bioactive compounds that decrease inflammation, lower blood pressure, enhance vascular health, and improve lipid profiles.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Together the many health benefits of ginger led scientists to conclude that “due to the biological functions and cardioprotective properties of ginger and its constituents, it may serve as a new therapeutic agent for various CVDs (cardiovascular diseases).”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers also confirmed that ginger has few adverse effects, deeming the superfood a worthwhile nutraceutical as it provides health benefits beyond basic nutrition, helping to prevent or manage disease.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ginger has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune-boosting characteristics, primarily due to its phenolic compounds, gingerol and shogaol, says &lt;a href="https://www.nymc.edu/som/faculty/naidu-srihari-s.php" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Srihari Naidu&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at New York Medical College.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additional research in the peer-reviewed journal &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11352747/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biomolecules&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; indicates that ginger favorably affects &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867422013770" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;hallmarks of aging&lt;/a&gt; at a cellular level. This is likely because ginger is a natural antioxidant, which can help neutralize free radicals that cause premature aging. However, Naidu says more research is needed to determine ginger’s exact effects on longevity and aging.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regular ginger consumption can significantly reduce triglyceride and LDL cholesterol (often known as “bad” cholesterol), while increasing HDL (or “good”) cholesterol, says Sathyamoorthy. This is especially beneficial for heart health as high levels of LDL cholesterol are &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2820%2932233-9/fulltext" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, he explains. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lower triglyceride levels are connected to better health of the inner &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1933287421000623%5C" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lining of the blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; (endothelium), which is important for overall cardiovascular functioning.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most research on the benefits of ginger involves daily consumption of anywhere from 500 milligrams to two grams, according to Naidu. “I would recommend staying within the lower dose, or around 500 milligrams a day, as higher doses can cause gastrointestinal side effects — such as abdominal discomfort and gas — and possibly increase bleeding risk, especially for those on blood thinners,” he says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK565886/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; recommends no more than four grams of ginger a day. Some people report heartburn or stomach upset with ginger intake, so those with ulcers should avoid regular consumption in any dose unless cleared by a doctor, says Naidu. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to the type of ginger, Vuppuluri recommends the raw ingredient because it’s the most potent, leading to maximum antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pickled ginger, as seen at Japanese sushi restaurants, is another great, less bitter option. Ginger tea and ginger powder are other accessible ways to incorporate the spice into your routine, though Naidu says more research is needed on the efficacy of both compared to its raw, unprocessed form.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, keeping ginger consumption consistent is the most important factor for those seeking to take advantage of its benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Naidu also cautions consumers to be careful with ginger supplements, because they are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. If you prefer a supplement, your doctor can guide you on the best option, but one helpful tip is to seek out a product that has been third-party tested (for example, NSF-, USP-, or GMP-certified). This means an unbiased party has tested the product and confirmed it only contains the ingredients listed on the label and in the amounts stated. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-ginger-has-many-more-additional-health-benefits"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Ginger has many more additional health benefits &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Aside from supporting cardiovascular health, ginger is a digestion superstar. Gingerol is found to &lt;a href="https://bmccomplementmedtherapies.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12906-023-04227-x" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stimulate the gut&lt;/a&gt; and improve gastrointestinal mobility, which means it helps food move efficiently through the digestive tract. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, thanks to ginger’s ability to increase digestive responsiveness and speed up stomach emptying, it may &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212267223015265" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;calm nausea&lt;/a&gt; from motion sickness, pregnancy, and chemotherapy, per Naidu.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Those same gingerols have antimicrobial and antifungal properties to help fight infection and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9483099/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;boost immunity&lt;/a&gt;.

The majority of cases are in West Texas, where an outbreak that shows no signs of abating began in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nearly all of the cases are among people who haven’t been vaccinated, but 3% of the identified cases are so-called &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:breakthrough infections.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;breakthrough infections.&lt;/a&gt; People got sick despite being either partially or fully vaccinated with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Infectious diseases doctors are at pains to emphasize that the MMR vaccine is one of the most effective vaccines on the market, but as Rodney Rohde, a professor at Texas State University explains, a small number of people who are fully vaccinated may get sick during a large outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One dose of the MMR vaccine is 93% effective at preventing measles, with the second dose increasing that to 97%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The vaccine is highly effective,” said Rohde. “But it means that after two doses, while 97 out of 100 people will develop strong immunity and be protected if exposed to measles, the remaining three out of 100 could still be vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The latest outbreak has seen claims circulating on social media from people who say they are fully vaccinated and still contracted a breakthrough infection, making them seriously unwell, something Rohde said is “slightly possible.” “They could fall into one of those small percentages that got the full vaccine but just didn’t respond,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, he said, it’s also plausible that those people may not have realized they weren’t fully vaccinated against measles. &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/80/3/663/7756619" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research suggests;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that when breakthrough infections occur, the MMR vaccine still tends to provide some partial protection. “If someone vaccinated does get measles, it’s often a milder version, sometimes called modified measles,” says Rohde. “A rash can still occur, but it may be less widespread [across the body], fainter or atypical, meaning it doesn’t follow the classic pattern of starting at the hairline and spreading downwards. Fever is also less common or lower-grade. In classic measles, fevers can spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, but in modified cases, it’s often milder or absent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to Rohde, the same is true for other common measles symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Conjunctivitis, or red eyes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“They may still occur, but are often less intense,” he says. “Koplik spots, which are tiny white spots in the mouth, are less commonly seen. Breakthrough cases are also generally less contagious, but still a potential source of transmission.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People are contagious four days before and four days after the rash begins, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Texas Department of State Health Services.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services. &lt;/a&gt;The rash usually appears 14 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Rohde also suggests that people experiencing severe symptoms from a breakthrough infection may have just had a single vaccine dose, which still offers significant protection, but not quite as much as the full two-dose regimen. “These cases can be closer to classic measles than in two-dose breakthroughs, with a high fever which may last longer,” he says. “The rash is usually a more typical measles rash and can be more extensive than in fully vaccinated breakthrough cases. They are also more likely to get possible complications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There’s still the question of why these infections happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As Rohde and others explain, there may be a number of reasons, ranging from the timing of vaccination to genetic variability in the immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measles vaccine immunity is mostly stable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has called for the public to get vaccinated against measles, he also claimed in an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2U0csKvqMY" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:interview with CBS News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;interview with CBS News&lt;/a&gt; that “&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/health-secretary-rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-falsely-claims-wanes-rcna200636" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the vaccine wanes very quickly.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;the vaccine wanes very quickly.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Vaccine experts counter that the MMR shots offer lifelong protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If immunity waned a lot, you would see a lot of cases in vaccinated people in older age groups, and we’re not seeing that in this Texas outbreak or any others in the recent past,” said Scott Weaver, a microbiology and immunology professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch, who also works with the Global Virus Network coalition of experts. “People seem to be solidly protected, and almost everybody for life, as far as we can tell.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unlike influenza or Covid, measles is a very stable virus that has evolved little to evade vaccine-induced immunity over time. In 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(21)00041-0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic researchers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Mayo Clinic researchers&lt;/a&gt; published a study concluding that there’s a near-zero probability of a novel measles virus naturally emerging with the capability of circumventing the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the virus isn’t changing, it appears that in some rare cases, the body’s own immune system can slowly stop producing antibodies against the virus. Based on international studies, scientists have concluded that it is possible for some children &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31184979/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vaccinated against measles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;vaccinated against measles&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35927136/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lose their protection;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;lose their protection &lt;/a&gt;over the course of two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Because measles is highly infectious, this waning is expected to cause some breakthrough infections,” said Alexis Robert, a researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who authored a paper on &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(24)00181-6/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:long-term vaccine protection;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;long-term vaccine protection&lt;/a&gt; in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;All people respond to either vaccines or natural infections a little bit differently, according to Weaver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The MMR vaccine, which works by presenting the immune system with a live but weakened version of the measles virus, trains the body’s immune cells to recognize different parts of the virus’ proteins called epitopes and generate antibodies against them in the future, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;An epitope refers to small segments of amino acids on a protein’s structure that the immune system’s antibodies learn to recognize and bind to, should the virus attempt to invade again in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s not unexpected that a few people respond poorly to any vaccine, Weaver said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Some people have a very robust response because they respond to many different [viral] epitopes, and some people, just by chance, have immune cells that can’t recognize as many of those epitopes,” he said. “Differences in our genetic makeup determine how many different epitopes we respond to and develop immune memory against.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ousted-fda-vaccine-chief-us-measles-elimination-status-threat-rcna199966" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:measles was declared eliminated in the U.S.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;measles was declared eliminated in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; in 2000 and no longer considered a public health threat, research into the virus slowed. With vaccine hesitancy rising and the U.S. close to losing its measles elimination status, some scientists see the need to study and monitor the rare cases of breakthrough infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“While transmission patterns show measles outbreaks are driven by groups of unvaccinated individuals, especially among children, a potential risk of infection years after vaccination still impacts what strategy is most effective and the coverage needed to eradicate measles,” Robert said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How quickly does the measles vaccine take effect?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Timing can also make a difference. A child who had just received the MMR vaccine will still be vulnerable to measles within the first couple of weeks, especially during an intense outbreak where a lot of virus is circulating, Rohde said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“In most cases, the human immune system takes roughly two weeks to develop enough protection against the measles virus and many other pathogens,” he said. “If you were exposed just before or after getting the vaccine, your body may not be at full strength.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In some cases, for example people who are either born with a weakened immune system or develop conditions such as autoimmune diseases or blood cancers, the body may not mount as effective an immune response against measles, resulting in breakthrough infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There are people who just have an overall immune system that’s just not as effective against many different infectious agents,” Weaver said. “We know about people who are immune compromised for certain reasons, like they’re HIV-infected, they’re under chemotherapy for cancer, things like that, but there are some people who are just born with immune systems that don’t function quite as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another plausible explanation is that people may have received a defective MMR vaccine, although Weaver said this is unlikely in the United States, where quality controls tend to be fairly stringent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“In the cases of measles, it’s a live virus, so that virus could become less infectious if it’s not stored properly and that could lead to less [immune] response,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;When you might need a measles booster&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Whether you’re more vulnerable to developing a breakthrough measles infection could also depend on when you were born. Before the first measles vaccines were developed in the 1960s, virtually everyone contracted the virus during childhood, providing those who survived with lifelong immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, people who were born between 1957 and 1968 received a first-generation measles vaccine made using an inactivated virus that did not work so well. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that anyone born within this time frame should get at least one MMR dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Between 1968 and 1989, most people received only a single MMR dose, making them slightly less well protected compared with people who got the standard two doses in the past 36 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, suggested that if someone who got only a single dose is near a current measles outbreak or is traveling internationally to a country where the virus is endemic, it could be worth checking with with a doctor about getting another dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Even if you’re truly immune and you get another dose of MMR, there’s no harm to that,” Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This article was originally published on &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-breakthrough-infections-causes-vaccine-symptoms-rcna201799" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NBCNews.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;NBCNews.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxPdjFLR1N1VVhlRFc2eFBhS1k5bnR4MmpMVGItdjE0SVlHa0xDOFlCMUx1aGdMTVFFRkFPck9rVGVIbGZfaDNybnZTSkhsNFpUZHNoNkYwZlZBcjVZN1M4UFNwYUcwT19qTS1UM2tibUpjR0NZUmpBSmFXRXVMYmJzZTNOX3k4bEk</guid></item><item><title>今天的杂草非常强大。但这不是你应该担心的。-石板 | Today’s Weed Is Incredibly Strong.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9mu9jsi004b4fm9h6hdbsz0@published"&gt;Getting too stoned always has been—and always will be—an absolutely awful feeling. You reach that tipping point where your high turns from mellow to paranoid, and all of a sudden you’re stumbling uncontrollably down a rabbit hole of terrifying thoughts which all lead to the conclusion that the world is ending. Nobody likes how it feels.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="111" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhi001j3b73exvzte9m@published"&gt;Ever since recreational cannabis became legal, the risks of overconsuming have raised debates about potency. (Remember Maureen Dowd’s 2014 &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27704837"&gt;hotel room freak-out&lt;/a&gt;?) That panic has returned with force in recent months, as cannabis has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/26/nx-s1-4977448/americans-report-using-marijuana-more-frequently-than-alcohol-what-are-the-risks-of-both"&gt;become more popular than ever&lt;/a&gt;, and dispensaries are advertising ever more potent products. Earlier this year, the New York Times blasted the cannabis industry for fighting bills that limit potency. Such laws have been proposed around the country, including in &lt;a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/A977#:~:text=2025%2DA977%20(ACTIVE)%20%2D%20Summary,other%20cannabis%20or%20hemp%20products."&gt;New York &lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/2025a_076_01.pdf"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; (where it applies only to people under 25), and &lt;a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/438/BillText/c1/PDF"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, and would put caps on THC flower potency between 0.3 and 15 percent. (Commercially available cannabis usually contains at least 20 percent THC.)&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhi001k3b73iqlpkb6l@published"&gt;The problem is that lawmakers and the media alike deeply misunderstand how cannabis potency actually works. Peter Grinspoon, a physician, Harvard Medical School instructor, and author of &lt;em&gt;Seeing Through the Smoke,&lt;/em&gt; on medical cannabis, told Slate that limits on the simple percentage of THC in cannabis products could actually hurt medical patients for a number of reasons. People adjust their doses based on the strength of a product—so if they’re smoking a product that’s half as strong, for example, they might end up smoking twice as much, doing further damage to their lungs. Studies &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93198-5.epdf"&gt;have shown&lt;/a&gt; that consumers will naturally use less when the product is stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhj001l3b73i5lml0sd@published"&gt;“When I was growing up, one of the arguments against cannabis was that it was so weak, you had to smoke so much, and it was bad for your lungs,” Grinspoon said. “Now it’s stronger. And the argument is it’s so dangerous because it’s so potent.” On top of potential lung damage, Grinspoon says that weakening potency will simply make cannabis more expensive for medical patients, and “twice as expensive for people on fixed incomes, like veterans and older people.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhj001m3b737jrr7j54@published"&gt;Existing and past laws limiting cannabis potency are misguided not just because they might actually lead people to consume more, but because they’re written in a way that fails to understand the complexity of cannabis potency, according to Brien Hoffhine, director of cultivation at Loudbird Cannabis in Boulder, Colorado. The misunderstanding originated with the 2018 Farm Bill, which stipulates that cannabis potency should be determined by the percentage of the cannabinoid delta 9 THC—the most well-known intoxicating component of cannabis—in a product.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhk001n3b73ne0kx08l@published"&gt;“They just had no idea how the science actually worked,” Hoffhine told Slate. What the lawmakers misunderstood is that THCA, which is often present in higher quantities than delta 9 THC and which does not influence legal potency levels in the Farm Bill, can convert to delta 9 THC when it’s smoked. On top of that, there are many other cannabinoids in the plant that can make a high more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhk001o3b73vdjvv6cv@published"&gt;Hoffhine admits that consumers gravitate toward high-THC products, and that influences what he grows and sells. He says that if the weekly menu that Loudbird puts out has products with THC levels below 20 percent, they won’t get any orders.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhk001p3b734gvo1iml@published"&gt;But the percentages listed on product labels and menus don’t tell the whole truth. THC potency is determined through mandatory lab testing. But, Hoffhine explained, labs can return dramatically different results for the same plant. It’s an open secret in the industry that brands will shop around labs to get the highest potency result, and multiple studies &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282396"&gt;have shown&lt;/a&gt; that potency labels on products are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10096267/#:~:text=%5B18%5D%20evaluated%2014%2C234%20samples%20of,retail%20(21.5%25%20%C2%B16.0)"&gt;usually inflated&lt;/a&gt;. So when the New York Times reports that a certain brand is selling the most potent weed around, they might inadvertently be promoting the brand’s dubious marketing claims.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhk001q3b73dc9ti4x1@published"&gt;Masha Ty, who works for ACS Laboratory, which tests cannabis products in Florida, told Slate that her lab has lost clients because they refused to inflate their THC numbers. “We don’t give them the high numbers that they want to see, so they leave,” Ty said. “It’s bad, right? But we’re under NDA. We can’t really call them out.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhl001r3b730pbp2zx6@published"&gt;Ty emphasizes that, unlike alcohol, cannabis potency is influenced by multiple components, and varies quite a bit based on the individual consumer. There are at least 118 cannabinoids in the plant that go beyond the well-known THC and CBD, and they all interact with one another to produce different kinds of highs. Different individuals, too, have different endocannabinoid systems, which will affect their response to different products. Terpenes, which exist in all plants, can also contribute to the quality of the high. These compounds help “steer” the experience, Ty explained, because they can make it focused, relaxing, or uplifting.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="38" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhl001s3b737o0znfu8@published"&gt;Newer to the market are THC distillates and concentrates, which can contain up to 95 percent THC. These products are more potent in some ways, but they also provide a more one-dimensional experience, because they only contain THC.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhm001t3b73xbwk6esx@published"&gt;Grinspoon is concerned about how the market has gravitated toward high-THC cannabis. “I think we fetishize high THC, and we could do a lot better with lower THC,” he said, adding that CBD can mitigate some of the addictive qualities of cannabis, and other cannabinoids have more medical benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="47" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhm001u3b7317yxrvmw@published"&gt;Grinspoon, Hoffhine, and Ty all agree that potency limits aren’t the answer, but they also find that the market focus on THC is misguided. To fix this, they want better research and education about all of the components of cannabis and how they affect different people differently.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="45" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhm001v3b735l0ewtji@published"&gt;For example, if people understood the science behind cannabis edibles, they’d know why some people simply aren’t affected by them , no matter how potent they are. “Some people don’t even process it,” Ty explained. “So they eat gummies and nothing will happen to them.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="25" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhm001w3b73luqvyqxq@published"&gt;It’s just one example of how deeply complicated cannabis potency is. Until lawmakers learn to understand it, they have no hope of effectively regulating &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
