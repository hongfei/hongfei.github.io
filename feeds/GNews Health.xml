            &lt;strong&gt;(CNN) — &lt;/strong&gt;For summertime beachgoers, the threat of sharks may loom large, but nature’s deadliest predator is actually much smaller.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000q3b6my2gh1l5g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The tiny mosquito is not only a warm-weather nuisance but also&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;wears the crown for “No. 1 killer of humanity across our existence,” according to historian Dr. Timothy C. Winegard. The predatory insect takes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128123652000032#bb0010" target="_blank"&gt;more than 1 million lives&lt;/a&gt; each year by transmitting lethal diseases. Sharks, meanwhile, are &lt;a href="https://www.ifaw.org/journal/faq-about-sharks#:~:text=How%20many%20people%20do%20sharks,each%20year%20by%20shark%20attacks." target="_blank"&gt;estimated to have a kill streak&lt;/a&gt; orders of magnitude smaller, at fewer than 10 people per year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000r3b6mnhw1z513@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Where humans go, mosquitoes have followed. Their itchy bites and the disease-causing pathogens they carry are infamous, and the insects are also responsible for driving many of humanity’s most essential turning points throughout history, said Winegard, author of “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mosquito-Human-History-Deadliest-Predator/dp/1524743429/" target="_blank"&gt;The Mosquito&lt;/a&gt;: A Human History of Our Deadliest Predator.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000s3b6mm65bd4ms@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/16/health/malaria-mosquito-control-scn"&gt;Malaria&lt;/a&gt; and yellow fever (have shaped) our historical journey from our hominid ancestral evolution … right to present day,” Winegard told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast, Chasing Life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000t3b6mgw88ryqa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Winegard, an associate professor of history at Colorado Mesa University, got the initial idea for his best-selling book from his dad’s interest in malaria.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000u3b6mjgt62ptl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The wee pest didn’t intrigue Winegard too much at first. “I kind of disparaged him and said, ‘Sure, dad, I’ll write a book on mosquitoes,’” he recalled. But once Winegard began going down the rabbit hole of mosquito-borne pathogens’ impact on humanity — including, but not limited to malaria, Zika   virus, dengue fever, yellow fever, chikungunya and West Nile virus — he couldn’t stop.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000v3b6mualqn6bb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The mosquito’s impact on history is still deeply felt in the present. &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria" target="_blank"&gt;More than half a million&lt;/a&gt; people die of malaria alone each year, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/09/health/malaria-drug-babies-africa-intl"&gt;disease-heavy regions&lt;/a&gt; have suffered financially as a result. “Northern Hemisphere countries don’t have endemic malaria, (so) they’re able to develop more affluent economies because they’re not continuously suffering from malaria,” Winegard said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000w3b6mabla7tyb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            Humans have been battling mosquitoes for millennia, and amid the season’s summer peak in the Northern Hemisphere, Winegard offered some insight into how you can keep them away this summer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000z3b6mpchtue5z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Eighty-five percent of what makes you alluring or less alluring to mosquitoes is prewired in your genetic circuit board,” according to Winegard. However, there are a few ways you can manage mosquitoes. He has these five tips.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800113b6m9joi46cz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Booze makes it easier for mosquitoes to see you, Winegard said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800123b6m9hkrd3eh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mosquitoes hunt by sight, but they don’t see the world like people do. The predatory insects employ thermal, or infrared, vision. “They see heat signatures,” Winegard noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800133b6mxcfsqcmn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Consuming alcohol raises your body temperature,” he explained over email, “which make(s) you an identifiable heat signature for your soon-to-be tormentor.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800143b6mfbihlute@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So, maybe reach for a refreshing glass of water or lemonade instead of that beer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800163b6mzucz63n1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition to using heat-based vision, mosquitoes hunt down humans primarily through smell.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800173b6mjtwpp6sm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Winegard said mosquitoes “can smell carbon dioxide from over 200 feet (60 meters) away.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800183b6mktk221ko@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “So if you’re exercising or breathing heavily, they’ll smell that and be attracted to it,” Winegard told Gupta.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800193b6mu70yo1g6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And just like alcohol, high CO2 emissions make detecting heat signatures easier for mosquitoes, so Winegard recommends keeping yourself as cool as possible.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001a3b6msyx2estk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This applies to your wardrobe, too. “Dark clothes retain relatively more heat,” he said, so it’s best to opt for lighter-colored, long-sleeved attire to keep mosquitoes at bay.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001c3b6m930dnw0r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Applying insect repellent is the gold standard for mosquito management, but if you’re not careful when applying it, you can leave yourself vulnerable to bites.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001d3b6mu0ucva0s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I know people who lather themselves in it, but they miss this little spot on the back of their calf and she’ll find the chink in our armor,” Winegard told Gupta, referring to the female mosquito, who is the bloodsucking hunter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001e3b6mdz4y0hvt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mosquito repellent isn’t like perfume, in which a few spritzes can cover your whole body. If you’re spraying, make sure to be thorough.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001f3b6ma8spo557@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “DEET (a chemical repellent) is still the gold standard, while oil of lemon eucalyptus is a plant-derived option,” Winegard said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001g3b6mgh9hynqd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For an added boost of security, he noted some clothes come pretreated with a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/prevention/about-permethrin-treated-clothing-and-gear.html#:~:text=clothing%20and%20gear-,Permethrin%20is%20an%20insecticide%20that%20kills%20or%20repels%20mosquitoes.,will%20help%20prevent%20mosquito%20bites." target="_blank"&gt;mosquito-targeted insecticide called permethrin&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001i3b6mf9tlgwbg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pool days and cool drinks outdoors offer a respite from the heat for humans, but they are equally as attractive to mosquitoes. Female mosquitoes lay their eggs in still water — and they don’t need much.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001j3b6mh38ewur3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “From a pond or stream to a minuscule collection in the bottom of an old container, used tire, or backyard toy — even a bottle cap full  — any will suffice,” Winegard said via email. Even waterlogged soil is enough for mom-to-be mosquitoes to lay their eggs in, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001k3b6muz2nunei@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Winegard recommended eliminating standing water around your home and yard to keep potential mosquito breeding grounds to a minimum.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001m3b6mpuz3hmwf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another way to fight the swarms this summer is to consider skipping a shower or two.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001n3b6m4rmsgp3f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s better to be stinky!” Winegard said. “Being pungently rancid is a good thing, for it increases bacterial levels on the skin, which makes you less alluring to mosquitoes.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001o3b6mrefqgjor@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While this may offend others, Winegard says to skip the scented products: Deodorants, soaps and other applied fragrances are all enticing to mosquitoes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001p3b6m6m93jbap@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The one exception is your feet. “Clean your feet,” he told Gupta. “The bacteria on our feet, which is the same one that ripens a lot of cheeses, is an aphrodisiac to mosquitoes.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001q3b6mric5kpde@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Winegard noted that this is the reason many of us get bitten around our ankles and feet. “So, wash your feet!” he urged.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001s3b6mif6clfzd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mosquitoes don’t care about most personal characteristics you can objectively see.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001t3b6man1zppc8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is absolutely no truth to the persistent myths that mosquitoes fancy females over males, that they prefer blondes and redheads over those with darker hair, or that the darker or more leathery your skin, the safer you are from her bite,” Winegard said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001u3b6m2nxjyrlg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But he noted that “she does play favorites and feasts on some more than others.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001v3b6my4n7focq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What might entice a mosquito? “Blood type O seems to be the vintage of choice over types A and B or their blend,” he said. “People with blood type O get bitten twice as often as those with type A, with type B falling somewhere in between.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001w3b6mflzzazk1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The creators of the 1998 movie “A Bug’s Life,” he noted, must have “done their homework when portraying a tipsy mosquito ordering a ‘Bloody Mary, O-positive.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001x3b6m04z1fqg9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Maybe it’s a mosquito’s world, Winegard suggests, and people are just living in it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Person County officials confirmed the sixth positive
rabies exposure case for the year. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, officials with the Person County Animal
Services and Person County Health Department said a bat on Rolling Hills Road resulted
in two confirmed rabies exposures. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;People are urged to take extra precautions when
approaching wild animals or animals they are unfamiliar with. Officials also
said people should: &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor your surroundings when outdoors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep children and pets supervised and away from wildlife &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make sure all pets are up to date on rabies vaccinations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid handling stray or injured animals, even seemingly friendly animals &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/news/state/person-county-sixth-rabies-case-rolling-hills-road-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Officials say anyone that may have been bitten or
scratched by an animal, or if a pet encounters a wild animal should call 911
and seek emergency medical care immediately. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;WRAL News has extensively &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/rabies/17483443/"&gt;covered rabies cases&lt;/a&gt; across North
Carolina. There is a full &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/story/what-to-do-if-you-see-an-animal-in-the-wild/20265048/"&gt;guide
online&lt;/a&gt; explaining what to do if you contact an animal in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;

            About two years ago, celebrity cosmetic dermatologist Dr. Paul Jarrod Frank noticed a new type of patient arriving at his New York practice. Amid an explosion in the number of Americans losing weight with drugs like Ozempic, he saw a “dramatic spike” in clients experiencing unwelcome side effects.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9b00053b6nh5thy399@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Although they felt much better losing weight, in some ways they felt they looked older,” he said via a voice note. “And this was due to the loss of volume in their face.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c00063b6n9ru2dikm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Frank started using the term “Ozempic face” — a label he believes he coined — to describe the phenomenon. It has since become a social media byword for the sagging skin and hollowed-out appearance that can accompany the use of GLP-1 medications like semaglutide (the active ingredient in branded drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c00073b6ne8k7bvum@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Usually, with people from their mid-40s and above, once you start losing 10-plus pounds, you can get this kind of deflated look,” said Frank, who is the founder of aesthetic health care brand PFRANKMD and the author of “The Pro-Aging Playbook.” “Certainly, people losing 20 or 30-plus pounds are going to have this problem.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Semaglutide works by stimulating the pancreas to trigger insulin production, curbing users’ appetite and contributing to feelings of fullness. Although the US Food and Drug Administration approved Ozempic to treat type 2 diabetes, doctors now commonly prescribe it off-label for weight management. About &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/10/health/ozempic-glp-1-survey-kff"&gt;1 in 8 adults&lt;/a&gt; in the US has used a GLP-1 drug, and of those, around 2 in 5 did so solely to lose weight, according to health policy non-profit KFF in 2024.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c00093b6nits8ca67@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Today, more than 20% of Frank’s patients are using GLP-1s as part of what he called their “longevity regimen.” The treatments sought after their weight loss include injectable dermal fillers to help restore facial volume, facelifts and fat transfers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000a3b6nscxngb6s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You can only refill a deflated balloon so much, and often surgical intervention is necessary,” he said. But for many patients, he added, “just upping the dosage of their volume replacement is more than enough.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000b3b6n1v7ljjqi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Someone who may have used one syringe of filler in the past is now using two or three.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000d3b6n2valg9vi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), which publishes an annual report on surgery trends, recently &lt;a href="https://www.plasticsurgery.org/news/plastic-surgery-statistics" target="_blank"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that 2 in 5 of its members’ GLP-1 patients were considering undergoing cosmetic surgery — and 1 in 5 already had.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000e3b6nw9w4be7j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among the patients opting for a facelift was Kimberly Bongiorno, a local government land use administrator from Mount Arlington, New Jersey. Having lost weight after gastric sleeve surgery in 2019, she regained 40 pounds during the Covid-19 pandemic and was prescribed Wegovy last year. Despite describing the drug’s impact as “almost a miracle” — taking her weight from 170 to 125 pounds — the 55-year-old faced new concerns over her appearance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000f3b6nxhghungw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Everything just kind of hung and was very loose,” she said over Zoom, recalling seeing her face in a photo shared by a friend. “I no longer felt like I had cheeks, and I had a lot of loose skin under my neck.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdpgwxcy00053b6n8bi79p0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It looked like I had melted. It was horrifying,” she added. “It was so disheartening to see how my face looked and how it had changed, I thought I looked a lot older than I am.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000h3b6n041gk21p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After consulting plastic surgeon Dr. Anthony Berlet at his New Jersey office, Bongiorno underwent a deep plane facelift that lifted her skin and repositioned some of the deeper muscles and connective tissues. She also opted for a neck lift that refined and smoothed her neck contours while addressing excess skin left by her weight loss.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000i3b6n8rlxoe1j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Before I did this, I probably looked closer to 60, or maybe even older. And now I have people who I’ve recently met think I am in my 40s,” Bongiorno said, adding: “People I haven’t seen in a while say, ‘You look so healthy and happy.’ And that’s nice to hear, because for a while, I didn’t look healthy and certainly wasn’t happy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdow3oyt00013b6nqb7buaxg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The number of facelifts performed in the US jumped 8% between 2022 and 2023, according to ASPS data. The use of hyaluronic acid fillers has meanwhile doubled from 2.6 million Americans in 2017 — the year Ozempic was first cleared for diabetes — to over 5.2 million in 2023.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000j3b6nraxx0wud@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The organization could not attribute these upticks exclusively to GLP-1 use, but its former president, Dr. Steven Williams, said the medications have had “a global effect on aesthetic surgery.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000k3b6nulksd71h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Now we have a brand-new tool that actually has efficacy for so many patients,” said Williams, a board-certified plastic surgeon and founder of California’s Tri Valley Plastic Surgery, over Zoom. He noted that GLP-1s come “without substantial drawbacks” when compared with invasive procedures like gastric bypass surgery.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000l3b6nja0cicus@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We can now have an honest conversation with patients about a nonsurgical tool that’s effective in weight loss,” he added. “And as part of that conversation, there’s an obligation to say, ‘Look, this is really going to work, so you have to be prepared for what looking 20 or 50 pounds slimmer is going to be.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000m3b6nfvlxtnax@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The term “Ozempic face” may speak to our times, but its symptoms — caused by a decrease in the subcutaneous fat that makes our faces plump — are nothing new. Cosmetic surgeons have long been treating the side effects of significant weight loss. In fact, one popular brand of dermal filler, Sculptra, was originally developed in the 1990s for HIV patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000n3b6nqhyt41e7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As an adult, “your body actually doesn’t make more fat cells,” Williams said. “As we lose or gain weight, those fat cells aren’t multiplying or decreasing; they’re getting bigger or smaller. And so as we lose weight, those fat cells now have decreased volume, and there’s just less fullness.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000p3b6ntoqjs5gh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Age can determine how patients’ faces react to weight loss. People in their 20s and 30s, for instance, are far less likely to experience the appearance of aging due to GLP-1 use, Frank said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000q3b6n052s2fcs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Because they have good skin elasticity, the skin rebounds much better,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000r3b6nvdudpl87@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Patients aged 20 to 39 accounted for 14% of hyaluronic acid filler use in the US and just 2% of facelift procedures last year, according to the ASPS. But both figures are &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/22/style/facelift-surgery-young-patients"&gt;on the rise&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000s3b6n1l8jyodb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Gabriela Vasquez, 29, is among the younger patients using GLP-1 to undergo cosmetic procedures after rapid weight loss. An employee of one of Williams’ Tri Valley Plastic Surgery clinics, she has dropped around 50 pounds since starting Ozempic in November.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000t3b6nlq5l8uoa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although Vasquez is still working toward her target weight, she sought preventative Botox injections (more visible lines and wrinkles are, along with thinning lips, among the other &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/ozempic-face-and-other-glp-1-side-effects" target="_blank"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt; of GLP-1 use). She has also recently undergone microneedling, a procedure used to stimulate collagen production.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000u3b6nhcpzar5g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One of my concerns was my jowls, because I felt I saw them when I was a little heavier,” she said over Zoom from the Bay Area. “I think the microneedling definitely helped.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdpl54mn00043b6nye61yyaf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I never had a jaw line,” she added. “And a couple weeks ago, someone took a picture of me, and I had one, and I was like, ‘Well, that’s new.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000v3b6n0wme1p23@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vasquez did not rule out further cosmetic procedures as she continues losing weight — and not only to her face and neck. “I’m seeing little things in my body that I’m like, ‘Whoa, that would be nice to take care of,’” she said, referencing the appearance of excess skin under her arms. “I could see myself — later down the line, once I get to my goal weight — doing something to kind of tighten everything up.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000w3b6nnbhl90lx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Frank, the cosmetic dermatologist, noted that “Ozempic face” may be accompanied by a phenomenon he dubbed “Ozempic body,” adding: “One of the other major side effects of weight loss, particularly when it’s done at a rate of more than one to two pounds a week, is muscle loss. And we see this all over the body.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The ASPS similarly notes the emerging term “Ozempic makeover,” a suite of procedures that might also include tummy tucks, breast lifts and arm, thigh and buttock lifts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000y3b6nxxzvj3iz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For instance, Bongiorno, the New Jersey facelift patient, has also undergone several other procedures with Dr. Berlet, including arm and thigh lifts, to address her excess skin. She estimates that after her upcoming breast lift, fat grafting and lower eyelid surgery, she will have spent about $80,000 on cosmetic procedures.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000z3b6n6upj7dqy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Skin is heavy and uncomfortable,” she said. “This wasn’t something I did to go out there and be a supermodel. It was just to be comfortable, so I could get clothes on and not feel like I was dragging around all this extra weight.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c00113b6n3dcdzvt3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The long-term effect of GLP-1 medications on cosmetic medicine is yet to be fully understood. The assumption they might reduce demand for liposuction, for instance, has not come to bear: It remains the most common cosmetic surgical procedure in the US, growing in popularity by 1% last year, per ASPS data.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c00123b6nly8v4bdv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What also remains to be seen is the effect that “Ozempic rebound” — when patients regain weight after stopping the drugs — has on people who sought cosmetic procedures.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c00133b6nt12hy9ds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2829779" target="_blank"&gt;recent peer-reviewed study&lt;/a&gt; found that most people using the drugs for weight loss quit within a year. Data presented at this year’s European Congress on Obesity meanwhile suggested that patients typically returned to their original weight within 10 months of stopping use, with University of Oxford researchers calling the findings a “cautionary note” about using medication “without a more comprehensive approach” to weight loss.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c00143b6n3bbrn2z9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For Williams, this further demonstrates why he and his plastic surgeon colleagues must take responsibility for their patients’ “entire journey,” not just their cosmetic procedures.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c00153b6nauifw6cv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We don’t want these patients to be on these medications for a lifetime. We want it to be a temporary bridge to a healthier lifestyle,” he said, adding: “It’s our obligation to work harder with those patients, to talk about lifestyle changes, to get them plugged in to dietitians and to make sure that they’re building muscle and exercising.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Fewer than 10 cases are reported each year in the U.S., but &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/article/health-52f7e46efac248b6998edee89e052b27"&gt;almost all are fatal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Here are some things to know about the amoeba, its latest victim and other dangers on freshwater lakes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The amoeba's scientific name is Naegleria fowleri and it is most dangerous in water that stays for a while over 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius), including in lakes and rivers in the U.S. and other places with hot, sometimes dry summers like Pakistan and Australia. Infections have been reported in 26 U.S. states as far north as Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The amoeba enters the brain through the olfactory nerve in the nose. Once inside, it causes an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Symptoms start as a fairly standard headache and nausea. By the time the pain becomes severe, it is almost always too late to save the infected person. Of the 167 cases reported in the U.S. between 1962 and 2024, only four people have survived, according to the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/naegleria/media/pdfs/naegleria_factsheet508c.pdf"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the deaths happened within five days of getting sick, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;One infection in a body of water doesn’t increase the chances of another infection in the same body of water, the agency said. The amoeba cannot move from one person to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;It was the first death from the amoeba in South Carolina since 2016, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Jaysen Carr went swimming at Lake Murray about 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Columbia over the July Fourth weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He got sick several days later and died on July 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;His father and mother had never heard of the amoeba before a doctor in tears told them what tests of his spinal fluid had found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Clarence Carr said he was shocked to learn South Carolina, like most other U.S. states, has no law requiring public reporting of deaths or infections from the amoeba. The lake wasn’t closed and no water testing was performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“My son was a very smart individual. If he had one warning, he would have thought swimming in the lake was a bad idea,” Carr said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The amoeba is fairly common and is most dangerous when the water is warm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;There is no science-based threshold for what level of the organism in the water would be safe or unsafe, and it would be difficult to test water regularly, the South Carolina Department of Environmental Services said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Researchers are trying to figure out why the infections are so rare. Some people have been found to have had antibodies, signaling they may have survived exposure. Others may die from brain swelling and other problems without the amoeba ever being detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“My son lost his life swimming. We assumed it was safe,” Carr said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Last year, the CDC started a pilot program of giving infected patients an antibiotic approved for use in Europe that has killed the amoeba in lab studies &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The amoeba can show up in hot springs, rivers and, on rare occasions, in tap water. That’s why doctors recommend using sterile water for cleaning nasal passages with a neti pot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The only way to be completely safe is to not swim in lakes or rivers and, if you do, keep your head above water. Pinching your nose or using nose clips when diving or swimming can keep water out of your nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;There are other dangers in swimming in lakes and rivers instead of pools, where chemicals can kill off dangerous bacteria and other organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;A mouthful of water could contain E.coli bacteria. And while the bacteria normally live in the intestines of healthy people and animals, some strains can cause a range of conditions, including urinary tract infection, cystitis, intestinal infection and vomiting, with the worst cases leading to life-threatening blood poisoning, according to &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/e-coli/symptoms-causes/syc-20372058"&gt;the Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Algae can also cause illnesses. Cyanobacteria — also referred to as blue-green algae — are plant-like organisms that live in water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The algae can look like foam, scum, mats, or paint on the surface of the water and can grow underneath it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The organisms can quickly grow out of control, or “bloom," in warm weather, helped along by excessive nutrients in fertilizers and pet waste carried along by stormwater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;Some of the algae produce toxins that can cause symptoms including skin irritation, stomach cramps, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, fever, sore throat, headache, muscle and joint pain, mouth blisters, seizures, and acute liver damage, according to the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/harmful-algal-blooms/about/index.html#:~:text=Algae%20and%20cyanobacteria%20(also%20called,make%20people%20and%20animals%20sick."&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 23:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxOeE5ac0RHSmQtcGt2ajBXMUVNYV8zMFJfRUVOZVZ3Yjc2cERmeUNYSkl4OWRHaEFrcXU2RFh0VzhyNWM2Z2l6TW1JRVFJR2NWTy1JMU1Da3VqcUxLdkN5MnNxWC14MkZtVGFaTWVTZ3RQNlZFVkVQUlo5dVpzZ0NfS3N2WUZnZ3paSzNyaTR3M0VaYm12eXE5aDRYcG5mOHfSAaQBQVVfeXFMTjVtRVhNZTZQWGRmbXFDZUpMT3NrUXRwa1JpeWdVRnRIaTJZLTRTWjFnZXhtUUFaVzE3a1V0czdaRnVGWTN5cnBvVHM3SERDckZPTUxYcnE4Y0t1UkhuNjNyMjZKYmxUSW53cE5Ma2tLMGpyaEwzNTV1RFQxeGhyTVFNeXh0SU9xMmtqb1Q4NVZrSW93c3JGQnNVVWJEZ09YV1dJRGY</guid></item><item><title>在南卡罗来纳州的一个湖泊上，一只吃大脑的阿米巴虫杀死了他们的儿子，父母们希望得到更多的警告- Star Tribune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizwFBVV95cUxQNmhwQmtKV2NxZU81MzNWTk9yWnBlTXVPczVSc3QybGpYUGtPRW0zWUhoR2hvQkNKSEdFWVRudWFtUzhVUTdHemxHUnFoSFlLeFFfZWJhMXEzTTNWSDdCcjU3Q0UzLS04dFVQUFl1YXNLSHZoWUdMcFRkVmt0UlUtT3B6dkl5by1hRHFwZmhEcnh3emttY0VlS0ZvcFpfcUs3dnV5NWc2bFJCSHNsQ1lLLWRMT0xjbzBqeHBHdFNycG10SFBFczloY0RIM2ppTGs?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;COLUMBIA, S.C.  — Two weeks after Jaysen Carr spent the Fourth of July swimming and riding on a boat on one of South Carolina's most popular lakes, he was dead from an amoeba that lives in the warm water and entered his brain through his nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;His parents had no clue the brain-eating amoeba, whose scientific name is Naegleria fowleri, even existed in Lake Murray, just 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Columbia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;They found out when a doctor, in tears, told them the diagnosis after what seemed like a fairly regular headache and nausea took a serious turn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Jaysen, 12, fought for a week before dying on July 18, making him one of about 160 people known to have died from the amoeba in the U.S. in the past 60 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;As they grieve their son, the boy's parents said they were stunned to learn South Carolina, like most other U.S. states, has no law requiring public reporting of deaths or infections from the amoeba.

							&lt;p data-start="281" data-end="390"&gt;We live in a world where “wellness” has become a buzzword, but disease still creeps in through the back door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="392" data-end="552"&gt;Everywhere you look, there’s another green juice, another detox kit, another celebrity-endorsed superfood promising to clean out your insides and give you glow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="554" data-end="599"&gt;And yet, cancer rates remain alarmingly high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="601" data-end="698"&gt;Despite the yoga apps, the mushroom powders, and the clean beauty swaps—we’re still getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="700" data-end="887"&gt;But there’s one diet change—backed by decades of research—that continues to stand out. One that consistently lowers cancer risk, supports immunity, and improves long-term health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="889" data-end="920"&gt;It’s not sexy. It’s not trendy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="922" data-end="942"&gt;It’s just… veganism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-section-id="11svawb" data-start="944" data-end="990"&gt;The plant-based connection you can’t ignore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="992" data-end="1033"&gt;I know. The word alone can be polarizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1035" data-end="1238"&gt;But hear me out—not from a moral soapbox, but from a health-conscious, evidence-following, former-skeptic who used to eat turkey sandwiches every day for lunch and believed cheese was its own food group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1240" data-end="1346"&gt;I’m not writing this to shame anyone. I’m writing this because the science is there—and we’re ignoring it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1348" data-end="1548"&gt;Multiple large-scale studies have shown that a vegan diet—meaning one that excludes all animal products—correlates with a reduced risk of several cancers, including colon, breast, and prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1550" data-end="1806"&gt;A 2022 study published in &lt;em data-start="1576" data-end="1590"&gt;BMC Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, which followed over 470,000 people in the UK, found that vegans had &lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-022-02256-w?.com"&gt;a 14% lower risk of cancer&lt;/a&gt; compared to meat-eaters. The difference was especially pronounced for hormone-related cancers like breast and prostate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1808" data-end="1954"&gt;Other studies have suggested that a vegan diet may reduce markers of inflammation and oxidative stress—two key contributors to cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1956" data-end="2122"&gt;And it’s not just about removing animal products. It’s about replacing them with fiber-rich, nutrient-dense plant foods that flood the body with protective compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2124" data-end="2191"&gt;As Dr. T. Colin Campbell, author of &lt;em data-start="2160" data-end="2177"&gt;The China Study&lt;/em&gt;, once said: “The closer people come to an all-plant, whole-food diet, the lower their risk for chronic disease—especially cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-section-id="ppfc5" data-start="2314" data-end="2340"&gt;But what about protein?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2342" data-end="2411"&gt;That’s the first question I asked when I first considered this shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2413" data-end="2637"&gt;For years, we’ve been trained to see meat as synonymous with protein. Never mind that lentils, quinoa, tofu, tempeh, beans, and even broccoli all contain plenty of protein—without the cholesterol and carcinogenic byproducts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2639" data-end="2816"&gt;The truth is, most people in developed countries consume more protein than they actually need—often at the expense of fiber, which the average person is &lt;em data-start="2792" data-end="2802"&gt;woefully&lt;/em&gt; deficient in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2639" data-end="2816"&gt;According to USDA data, adults in wealthier nations typically exceed protein requirements (around 103 g/day versus the ~56 g RDA), yet average fibre intake hovers around just 10–20 g/day—&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/78/Supplement_1/29/5877740?&amp;amp;login=false"&gt;far below the recommended&lt;/a&gt; 25–30 g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2818" data-end="3053"&gt;And guess what? Fiber doesn’t just help with digestion. It also plays a key role in binding and eliminating excess hormones and carcinogens from the body—something that’s especially important when we talk about breast and colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3055" data-end="3157"&gt;A plant-based diet gives you both: enough protein and more fiber than any meat-centric meal ever will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-section-id="kskko8" data-start="3159" data-end="3193"&gt;So why don’t more people do it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3195" data-end="3231"&gt;Honestly? Because it’s inconvenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3233" data-end="3361"&gt;Because it goes against tradition, against cravings, against that comforting childhood memory of grilled cheese and tomato soup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3363" data-end="3471"&gt;Because the idea of “giving up” animal products feels like a punishment, even when the benefits are glaring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3473" data-end="3632"&gt;We’re creatures of habit. We like our routines. We don’t want to read labels, explain our choices at dinner parties, or say no to Mom’s famous chicken pot pie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3634" data-end="3745"&gt;I’ve been there. I used to roll my eyes at vegans at work potlucks, thinking they were overcomplicating things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3747" data-end="3850"&gt;But then I started noticing how good they looked. Clear skin. Energy after lunch. No afternoon crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3852" data-end="3962"&gt;And when I started reading the research—not the headlines, but the actual studies—I couldn’t unsee what I saw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3852" data-end="3962"&gt;Studies show that plant-based diets rich in whole foods and antioxidants significantly&lt;a href="https://www.learnskin.com/articles/plant-based-diet-and-what-it-does-for-skin-health/?.com"&gt; improve skin health&lt;/a&gt;, aiding conditions like acne, psoriasis, and eczema—likely through reduced inflammation and a healthier gut–skin axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3852" data-end="3962"&gt;Similarly, clinical reviews confirm that a whole-food, plant-centric diet is linked to&lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2025/02/05/a-large-study-in-the-u-s-and-europe-confirms-the-health-benefits-of-plant-based-diets/?.com"&gt; greater energy&lt;/a&gt;, better mood, and reduced post-lunch fatigue—thanks to steady blood sugar and anti-inflammatory effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3852" data-end="3962"&gt;So while it may feel inconvenient to change your habits or explain your choices, science was already changing—and confirming—what I was seeing in front of my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-section-id="szagdv" data-start="3964" data-end="4012"&gt;My turning point wasn’t dramatic—it was quiet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4014" data-end="4072"&gt;It didn’t happen after a diagnosis or a documentary binge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4074" data-end="4183"&gt;It was a slow unraveling. A breadcrumb trail of facts that started building into something I couldn’t ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4185" data-end="4440"&gt;I was flipping through a medical journal in a waiting room when I stumbled across a study linking dairy consumption to increased breast cancer risk. A week later, I read about the carcinogenic compounds formed when red meat is cooked at high temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4442" data-end="4630"&gt;Then came the meta-analysis linking meat-heavy diets with cancer mortality. The one that showed a fourfold increase in cancer risk among middle-aged adults who ate a lot of animal protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4632" data-end="4662"&gt;And I thought—what am I doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4664" data-end="4784"&gt;I’ve always been a believer in prevention. In showing up early to the problem instead of cleaning up after the wreckage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4786" data-end="4812"&gt;So I started cutting back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4814" data-end="4848"&gt;First meat. Then dairy. Then eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4850" data-end="4988"&gt;I didn’t become a different person overnight. I just became someone more interested in my long-term health than my short-term convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-section-id="1yq7kqb" data-start="4990" data-end="5027"&gt;The benefits weren’t just physical&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5029" data-end="5100"&gt;Within a few weeks, I felt lighter—not just in my body, but in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5102" data-end="5171"&gt;I had more energy during the day. Fewer stomach issues. Better sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5173" data-end="5227"&gt;But there was something else I hadn’t expected: peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5229" data-end="5377"&gt;Because making that choice every day—to eat in a way that aligned with both the science &lt;em data-start="5317" data-end="5322"&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; my values—didn’t feel restrictive. It felt empowering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5379" data-end="5435"&gt;I wasn’t just avoiding disease. I was choosing vitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5437" data-end="5581"&gt;And maybe that’s why this shift is so misunderstood. Because it gets lumped into a category of deprivation, when really, it’s about nourishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-section-id="t7fko6" data-start="5583" data-end="5609"&gt;It’s not all or nothing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5611" data-end="5690"&gt;Let me be clear: you don’t need to label yourself a vegan to reap the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5692" data-end="5758"&gt;This isn’t a purity contest. It’s about direction, not perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5760" data-end="5937"&gt;Even moving toward a more plant-based lifestyle—like eating vegan meals most of the week or replacing animal products where it’s easy—can have measurable impacts on your health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5939" data-end="6003"&gt;Plant-based diets reduce the risk of cancer by &lt;a href="https://www.pcrm.org/news/health-nutrition/plant-based-diets-follow-national-recommendations-reduce-inflammation?.com"&gt;supporting immune function&lt;/a&gt; and reducing inflammation and hormone levels associated with tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6158" data-end="6234"&gt;That’s not niche advice. That’s rooted in decades of public health research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6236" data-end="6286"&gt;So no, you don’t have to become a tofu evangelist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6288" data-end="6366"&gt;But you &lt;em data-start="6296" data-end="6303"&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; start by swapping your morning omelet for oatmeal and berries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6368" data-end="6407"&gt;Or trying a bean chili instead of beef.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6409" data-end="6459"&gt;Or saying yes to that almond milk latte next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6461" data-end="6481"&gt;Every choice counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-section-id="nfbd1k" data-start="6483" data-end="6521"&gt;Cancer doesn’t wait for convenience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6523" data-end="6650"&gt;We like to believe we have time. That we’ll change when things slow down, or after the holidays, or when we’re finally “ready.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6652" data-end="6730"&gt;But cancer doesn’t wait for the perfect moment. And neither should prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6732" data-end="6839"&gt;Our food choices are among the most powerful tools we have—and yet they’re often the last thing we address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6841" data-end="6867"&gt;Not because we don’t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6869" data-end="6923"&gt;But because we’re afraid of what change might cost us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6925" data-end="6998"&gt;Here’s what I’ve learned: the cost of not changing is often much greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-section-id="6w7uql" data-start="7000" data-end="7018"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7020" data-end="7057"&gt;I’m not here to tell you what to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7059" data-end="7152"&gt;I’m just inviting you to think bigger about what your diet is doing &lt;em data-start="7127" data-end="7132"&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; you—or against you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7154" data-end="7272"&gt;Veganism isn’t about rules or righteousness. It’s about reclaiming agency in a world that profits off our poor habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7274" data-end="7439"&gt;It’s about recognizing that our bodies are capable of extraordinary healing—when we stop feeding them things that harm and start flooding them with things that help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7441" data-end="7462"&gt;And yes, it’s simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7464" data-end="7524"&gt;Maybe not emotionally simple. Maybe not logistically simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7526" data-end="7573"&gt;But biologically? Metabolically? Statistically?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7575" data-end="7655"&gt;It’s one of the simplest, most powerful levers we can pull for long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7657" data-end="7696"&gt;So before you dismiss it, ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7698" data-end="7779"&gt;What’s one small shift I could make today to give my body a better shot tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7781" data-end="7798"&gt;Then start there.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COLUMBIA, S.C. — The parents of 12-year-old Jaysen Carr, who &lt;a href="/article/news/local/brain-eating-amoeba-south-carolina/101-da55c2f0-ec50-4446-9353-d77c6c8fca0f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;died earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; after contracting a rare &lt;a href="/article/news/health/jaysen-carr-identified-amoeba-death-lake-murray-suspected/101-ddc9dd05-eacf-4528-987d-97b55e2e84d1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;brain-eating amoeba&lt;/a&gt;, spoke publicly for the first time Tuesday, calling on state agencies and lawmakers to take action so that no other family experiences the pain they are now facing.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jason should still be here,” Jaysen’s father, Clarence Carr, said during a news conference in Columbia. “There’s absolutely no excuse why he shouldn't be.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaysen died on July 18 after being hospitalized for over a week and a half. His family said the infection came after he swam in Lake Murray over the July 4th holiday.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Carrs were joined by their attorney, Tyler Bailey, who said the family has not been contacted by any public health or environmental agency following their son's death. Bailey identified the cause of death as &lt;em id="isPasted"&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/em&gt;, an amoeba that thrives in warm freshwater and is almost always fatal once symptoms begin.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not one agency has reached out. There’s never been any testing of the water. No questioning of where Jaysen was swimming,” Bailey said. “We’re doing the work the agencies should have done.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaysen’s father shared how the illness progressed. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We just assumed it was a regular migraine or headache,” Clarence Carr said. “But in hindsight, this was no headache. He was being attacked.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After returning from the lake, his son complained of a headache. “We gave him some Tylenol, and he said he felt better,” Clarence Carr said. “The next day he felt the same, so we went to the ER.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after a hospital visit and antibiotics, Jaysen’s condition worsened. Eventually, doctors performed a spinal tap to test for meningitis. “We did disclose he had been in Lake Murray,” Clarence said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaysen continued to fight despite the odds. "I've never witnessed anyone with the will to fight like my son, and I probably won't ever," Carr added. He refused to quit."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Carolina Department of Health is not required by law to be notified by hospitals nor is ordered to track this particular illness. Usually, that data is reported federally to the Centers for Disease Control. There's also no testing mechanism for the amoeba, which is naturally occurring and can be found in almost any freshwater lake or river. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The state already has a mechanism in place for testing our beaches,” Bailey said. “But our lakes are where the residents go, and there should not be a distinction between the two.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bailey said the family plans to push for legislative changes, including requiring routine testing of lakes for deadly pathogens, adding &lt;em&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/em&gt; to the state’s list of reportable diseases, and issuing public safety advisories when water temperatures climb above 80 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We want the Department of Environmental Services to begin testing immediately,” Bailey said. “The same system we have for beaches can be duplicated for our lakes.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family said Jaysen’s story highlights the importance of informed choices.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They say it’s rare,” Ebony Carr said. “But how rare is it when it happens to your child? That risk is too high.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bailey said water temperature and levels are already tracked at Lake Murray. He believes those systems can also be used to issue health advisories.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A simple message like, ‘Water temperatures are high, there may be a risk of amoeba exposure—please use caution,’ could save lives,” Bailey said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaysen's family said he was a gifted athlete and musician, who was also involved in supporting students with special needs at his school.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He played three different divisions of baseball. He was in honor band. He loved unconditionally,” said his mother, Ebony Carr. “He either loved you or just didn’t know you yet.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Carrs say they are just beginning their advocacy journey. A state lawmaker, Rep. Jermaine Johnson, has expressed interest in filing legislation later this year. But the family says they want immediate action from public health and environmental agencies.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we had known the risk, he wouldn’t have been in that lake,” Clarence Carr said. “We want other parents to know. We don’t want any other child to go through this.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family is urging people to contact their lawmakers and agency leaders to demand changes that will protect South Carolina families.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jaysen was a fighter,” Bailey said. “And now, his legacy will be a fight for something greater—safety, awareness, and change.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 20, 2023, health officials in the County of San Diego, California, put out &lt;a href="https://www.countynewscenter.com/health-officials-investigating-outbreak-linked-to-raw-milk/"&gt;a press release&lt;/a&gt; warning of a &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt; outbreak linked to raw (unpasteurized) milk. Such an outbreak is not particularly surprising; the reason the vast majority of milk is pasteurized (heated briefly to kill germs) is because milk can easily pick up nasty pathogens in the farmyard that can cause severe illnesses, particularly in children. It's the reason public health officials have long and strongly warned against consuming raw milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of the press release, officials in San Diego county had identified nine residents who had been sickened in the outbreak. Of those nine, three were children, and all three children had been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 25, the county put out &lt;a href="https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-updates-raw-milk-salmonella-case-count-and-product-recall/"&gt;a second press release&lt;/a&gt;, reporting that the local case count had risen to 12, and the suspected culprit—&lt;a href="https://www.marlerblog.com/files/2024/07/fdbFrRFL3n.pdf"&gt;raw milk and raw cream from Raw Farm LLC&lt;/a&gt;—had been recalled. The same day, Orange County's health department put out its own &lt;a href="https://www.ochealthinfo.com/press/salmonella-infections-orange-county-linked-raw-milk-raw-farm-llc"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, reporting seven cases among its residents, including one in a 1-year-old infant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both counties noted that the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), which had posted the recall notice, was working on the outbreak, too. But, it doesn't appear that CDPH ever followed up with its own press release about the outbreak. The CDPH did post tweets related to the outbreak: &lt;a href="https://x.com/CAPublicHealth/status/1717631849558913229"&gt;one on October 26, 2023,&lt;/a&gt; announced the recall; &lt;a href="https://x.com/CAPublicHealth/status/1730300684849795213"&gt;a second on November 30, 2023,&lt;/a&gt; noted "a recent outbreak" of &lt;em&gt;Salmonella &lt;/em&gt;cases from raw milk&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;but linked to general information about the risks of raw milk; and &lt;a href="https://x.com/CAPublicHealth/status/1732807204430921907"&gt;a third on December 7, 2023,&lt;/a&gt; linked to general information again with no mention of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that seems to be the extent of the information at the time. For anyone paying attention, it might have seemed like the end of the story. But, according to the final outbreak investigation report—&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7427a1.htm"&gt;produced by CDPH and local health officials&lt;/a&gt;—the outbreak actually ran from September 2023 to March 2024, spanned five states, and sickened at least 171 people. That report was released last week, on July 24, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In late June, the Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO), a group of independent experts convened by the World Health Organization (WHO), &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/independent-assessment-of-the-origins-of-sars-cov-2-from-the-scientific-advisory-group-for-the-origins-of-novel-pathogens"&gt;published an assessment&lt;/a&gt; of the origins of COVID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report concluded that although we don’t know conclusively where the virus that caused the pandemic came from: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a zoonotic origin with spillover from animals to humans is currently considered the best supported hypothesis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAGO did not find scientific evidence to support “a deliberate manipulation of the virus in a laboratory and subsequent biosafety breach”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This follows a series of &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/who-convened-global-study-of-origins-of-sars-cov-2-china-part"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-virology-093022-013037"&gt;research papers&lt;/a&gt; since the early days of the pandemic that have reached similar conclusions: COVID most likely emerged from an infected animal at the Huanan market in Wuhan, and was not the result of a lab leak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But conspiracy theories about COVID’s origins persist. And this is hampering our ability to prevent the next pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Attacks on our research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As experts in the emergence of viruses, we published a peer-reviewed paper in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 on the origins of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like SAGO, we evaluated several hypotheses for how a novel coronavirus could have emerged in Wuhan in late 2019. We concluded the virus very likely emerged through a natural spillover from animals – a “zoonosis” – caused by the unregulated wildlife trade in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, our paper has become a focal point of &lt;a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/03/12/covid-likely-came-from-a-lab-and-it-matters-enormously-to-prevent-another-pandemic/"&gt;conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://oversight.house.gov/hearing/investigating-the-proximal-origin-of-a-cover-up/"&gt;political attacks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea SARS-CoV-2 might have &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/03/opinion/covid-lab-leak.html"&gt;originated in a laboratory&lt;/a&gt; is not, in itself, a conspiracy theory. Like many scientists, we &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/scientists-exactly-zero-evidence-covid-19-came-lab"&gt;considered that possibility seriously&lt;/a&gt;. And we still do, although evidence hasn’t emerged to support it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the public discourse around the origin of the pandemic has increasingly been shaped by &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/lab-leak-true-origins-of-covid-19/"&gt;political agendas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/08/opinion/covid-fauci-hearings-health.html"&gt;conspiratorial narratives&lt;/a&gt;. Some of this has &lt;a href="https://www.aei.org/op-eds/the-proximal-origin-of-a-scientific-fraud/"&gt;targeted our work&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/lab-leak-proponents-rutgers-accused-defaming-and-intimidating-covid-19-origin"&gt;vilified experts&lt;/a&gt; who have studied this question in a data-driven manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common conspiracy theory claims &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/opinion/covid-pandemic-lab-leak.html"&gt;senior officials pressured us&lt;/a&gt; to promote the “&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/lab-leak-true-origins-of-covid-19/"&gt;preferred&lt;/a&gt;” hypothesis of a natural origin, while silencing the possibility of a lab leak. Some conspiracy theories even propose &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/07/21/covid-origin-nih-lab-leak/"&gt;we were rewarded&lt;/a&gt; with grant funding in exchange. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2023/03/scicheck-no-evidence-scientists-received-grant-for-changing-opinion-on-pandemic-origins-contrary-to-claims/"&gt;narratives are false&lt;/a&gt;. They &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2021133117"&gt;ignore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj0016"&gt;dismiss&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/03/opinion/covid-lab-leak.html"&gt;misrepresent&lt;/a&gt; the extensive body of evidence on the origin of the pandemic. Instead, they rely on selective quoting from private discussions and a distorted portrayal of the scientific process and the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/38/12/5211/6353034"&gt;motivations of scientists&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-react-class="BlueskyEmbed" data-react-props='{"uri":"at://did:plc:univ47kzorwxjih3lqzrnwmv/app.bsky.feed.post/3lslxgkd72s2o"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;So what does the evidence tell us?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the five years since our Nature Medicine paper, a substantial body of new evidence has emerged that has deepened our understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 most likely emerged through a natural spillover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2020, the case for a zoonotic origin was already compelling. Much-discussed features of the virus &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867421009910"&gt;are found in related coronaviruses&lt;/a&gt; and carry signatures of natural evolution. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 showed no signs of laboratory manipulation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The multi-billion-dollar &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/china-cracking-down-its-wildlife-trade-it-enough"&gt;wildlife trade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.actasia.org/news/actasias-fur-report-update-2022-2023/"&gt;fur farming industry&lt;/a&gt; in China regularly moves high-risk animals, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)00194-5"&gt;frequently infected with viruses&lt;/a&gt;, into dense urban centres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s believed that SARS-CoV-1, the virus responsible for the SARS outbreak, emerged this way in 2002 in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673603146302/fulltext"&gt;China’s Guangdong province&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, detailed analyses of epidemiological data show the earliest known COVID cases &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8715"&gt;clustered around&lt;/a&gt; the Huanan live-animal market in Wuhan, in the Hubei province, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON229"&gt;in December 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple independent data sources, including early &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm4454"&gt;hospitalisations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)00991-0"&gt;excess pneumonia deaths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666606521000031"&gt;antibody studies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670121000463"&gt;infections among health-care workers&lt;/a&gt; indicate COVID first spread in the district where the market is located. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8715"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; we and other experts showed that environmental samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 clustered in the section of the market where wildlife was sold. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)00901-2"&gt;2024 follow-up study&lt;/a&gt; we demonstrated those same samples contained genetic material from susceptible animals – including raccoon dogs and civets – on cages, carts, and other surfaces used to hold and transport them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t prove infected animals were the source. But it’s precisely what we would expect if the market was where the virus first spilled over. And it’s contrary to what would be expected from a lab leak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These and all &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8337"&gt;other independent lines of evidence&lt;/a&gt; point to the Huanan market as the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add8384"&gt;early epicentre&lt;/a&gt; of the COVID pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Hindering preparedness for the next pandemic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speculation and conspiracy theories around the origin of COVID have &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jvi.00089-23"&gt;undermined trust in science&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_balance"&gt;false balance&lt;/a&gt; between lab leak and zoonotic origin theories assigned by some commentators has added fuel to the conspiracy fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02981-z"&gt;anti-science agenda&lt;/a&gt;, stemming in part &lt;a href="https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1096/fba.2023-00032"&gt;from COVID origin conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt;, is being used to help justify deep cuts to funding for biomedical research, public health and global aid. These areas are essential for pandemic preparedness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States this has meant major cuts to the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/08/hhs-mass-firings"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01397-1"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;, the closure of the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c307zq8ppj6o"&gt;US Agency for International Development&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2501790"&gt;withdrawal from the WHO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ajtmh.org/view/journals/tpmd/111/1/article-p216.xml"&gt;Undermining trust in science&lt;/a&gt; and public health institutions also hinders the development and uptake of &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/03/28/g-s1-56881/vaccines-gavi-usaid-rubio"&gt;life-saving vaccines and other medical interventions&lt;/a&gt;. This leaves us more vulnerable to future pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amplification of conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID has promoted a dangerously flawed understanding of pandemic risk. The idea that a researcher discovered or engineered a pandemic virus, accidentally infected themselves, and unknowingly sparked a global outbreak (in exactly the type of setting where natural spillovers are known to occur) defies logic. It also detracts from the significant risk posed by the wildlife trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-virology-093022-013037"&gt;evidence-based conclusion&lt;/a&gt; that the COVID pandemic most likely began with a virus jumping from animals to humans highlights the very real risk we increasingly face. This is &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn2222"&gt;how pandemics start&lt;/a&gt;, and it will happen again. But we’re dismantling our ability to stop it or prepare for it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

There was a time in my 20s when I worked out consistently. I took a mix of fitness classes, such as &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/specials/start-today/" target="_blank"&gt;boxing, cardio dance, HIIT&lt;/a&gt; and even bootcamps, when I was feeling really ambitious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d3eddd" class="body-graf"&gt;When the pandemic hit and everything shut down, I kept &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/10-tips-virtual-fitness-classes-during-covid-19-t192823" target="_blank"&gt;working out through virtual classes&lt;/a&gt; to try to cling to some sense of normalcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9e3c54" class="body-graf"&gt;Once the world opened back up, I fell off. My job remained remote, so I had no real reason to leave my apartment. I tried to return to the classes I’d loved, but so many studios had closed down, and the remaining ones were no longer convenient for me without an office nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c339cf" class="body-graf"&gt;These days, the most exercise I get is walking from my bed to my couch to my “office” inside my 700-square-foot apartment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8e7e89" class="body-graf"&gt;My lack of daily movement had started to take its toll. In addition to gaining weight, I had &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/mind-body/7-expert-backed-ways-boost-energy-rcna22995" target="_blank"&gt;no energy&lt;/a&gt;, struggled to fall asleep, and had body aches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-949a95" class="body-graf"&gt;I’m only 37. I’m too young to feel this old.  I knew I had to do &lt;em&gt;something &lt;/em&gt;to get more movement into my daily routine. My social media algorithm must have sensed this, relentlessly serving me video after video of fitness influencers out on their hot girl walks, trying to get their steps in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ddf34e" class="body-graf"&gt;Could &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/national-walking-day-rcna77959" target="_blank"&gt;walking an hour every day&lt;/a&gt; really do anything substantial for my health? &lt;a href="https://stepitupwithsteph.com/"&gt;Stephanie Mansour&lt;/a&gt;, Start TODAY trainer and TODAY fitness contributor, assured me it could. “&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/specials/start-today/" target="_blank"&gt;Regular walking&lt;/a&gt; can significantly contribute to weight loss by burning calories and boosting your metabolism,” she explained. According to Mansour, walking can also improve cardiovascular health by strengthening your heart, lowering your blood pressure, and reducing the risk of heart disease. My blood pressure was borderline high at my last physical, so this got my attention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-528681" class="body-graf"&gt;I’d also been having chronic back and shoulder pain, which, you guessed it, can see improvement from simply walking more. “Daily walks create muscle endurance, strengthen bones, and improve joint health, making it a fantastic low-impact exercise option,” Mansour says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-6e18ba"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2000" data-original-width="2000"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/walking-1-hour-a-day-zz-250728-02-e7e906.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/walking-1-hour-a-day-zz-250728-02-e7e906.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/walking-1-hour-a-day-zz-250728-02-e7e906.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/walking-1-hour-a-day-zz-250728-02-e7e906.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/walking-1-hour-a-day-zz-250728-02-e7e906.jpg" alt="Danielle Page before and after."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Danielle Page added a 1-hour walk to her daily routine and lost 5 pounds in a month.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Danielle Page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0692e5" class="body-graf"&gt;Committing to a non-negotiable walk for an hour a day seemed like the lowest-effort way to motivate myself to move more, so I decided to give it a try. Here’s what happened:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-9b0cff" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8f832b" class="body-graf"&gt;On day one, I weighed in at 149 pounds. This is the most weight I’ve ever carried on my 5’2” frame, and it was shocking to see. I took my measurements, laced up my sneakers and braced myself for an hour of walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-abf0dd" class="body-graf"&gt;I was surprised at how tired I became almost immediately — the minutes dragged by. I attempted to pass the time by calling my mom to catch up. By the end of the call, I thought I’d knocked out at least half an hour of my walk. I was shocked to see only 13 minutes had gone by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4a5a59" class="body-graf"&gt;The next day, the &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/doms-sore-muscles-after-workout-rcna42188" target="_blank"&gt;backs of my legs were sore,&lt;/a&gt; and I wasn’t looking forward to this walk at all. I decided to break it up into half-hour increments, which were easier to complete separately, but made me dread that last half hour for the rest of the day. It was so tempting to skip it. Halfway through week one, I decided that breaking my walk in two was dragging things out and went back to a full hour. To keep myself motivated, I found destinations to walk to that I had wanted to visit. Some days, it was making it down to the park, about a half-hour walk from me each way. Most days, it was a cute coffee shop or lunch spot I’d wanted to try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-704523" class="body-graf"&gt;By the end of week one, I had accepted that walking for an hour was now a permanent part of my daily routine, but never looked forward to it. I did notice I was &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/sleep/3-2-1-sleep-rule-rcna172261" target="_blank"&gt;sleeping a bit better&lt;/a&gt; than I normally do. Each day, I knocked my walk out first thing, which gave me a more consistent morning routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-daabc7" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Struggling to start your own walking routine? Ease into it with this &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/specials/start-today/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;7-Day Audio Walking Challenge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; for a daily motivational podcast to help you get your steps in!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-b4ad50" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d65d9a" class="body-graf"&gt;Walking wasn't quite as painful during week two, and most days I was able to knock it out &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/specials/start-today/" target="_blank"&gt;with a podcast&lt;/a&gt; and forego getting myself a little treat (though it was hard to resist). I felt my stamina improve toward the end of this week, and I noticed I got slightly &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/walking-steps-vs-minutes-vs-miles-rcna213522" target="_blank"&gt;farther on my walks&lt;/a&gt; in the same amount of time as I had during the previous week. At first, I struggled to get my walks over the two-mile mark, but by the end of week two, I was hitting 2.5 miles without much trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3dacbb" class="body-graf"&gt;Everything was going well until a heat wave hit my city. Up until this point, I’d been walking outdoors, but several days during week two hit almost 100 degrees, so I had to find an alternative. I dusted off my barely used gym membership to complete my hour-long &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/hiit-treadmill-workouts-rcna121189" target="_blank"&gt;walks on a treadmill&lt;/a&gt; for a few days while I waited for things to cool off. It took the pressure off of figuring out what route I’d take, but by the third day of this, I was pretty bored. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8598ba" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;For days when the weather doesn't cooperate, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/specials/start-today/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;try a fun Indoor Walking Routine with Al Roker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-447db1" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-628d49" class="body-graf"&gt;During week three, I went to visit family in Long Island. Thanks to the change in scenery, this was probably the only time I really enjoyed walking for an hour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0b4548" class="body-graf"&gt;“Variety can keep things interesting and prevent burnout,” says Mansour, who encouraged me to change my routine to challenge different muscles and avoid boredom. So I committed to trying a new path every day to give my mind something new to focus on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-335de8" class="body-graf"&gt;Walking was finally part of my routine. I’d wake up around the same time each morning, get my walk out of the way, have breakfast and log on to start working for the day. During week three, I noticed a shift in my energy levels and &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/mind-body/happy-foods-rcna206268" target="_blank"&gt;overall mood&lt;/a&gt;. I felt more focused at work and more invigorated overall. Also, I slept like a baby. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-685afb" class="body-graf"&gt;“Beyond the physical changes, walking delivers impressive &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/non-scale-victories-nsv-rcna98828" target="_blank"&gt;non-scale victories&lt;/a&gt; (NSV),” Mansour explains. “Many people experience a noticeable boost in energy levels and better sleep quality,” Mansour said. Walking is also a great mood enhancer, releasing endorphins that&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/mind-body/1-breathing-technique-anxiety-smorning-routine-rcna181347" target="_blank"&gt; combat stress and anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, making you happier and more balanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-39fefc" class="body-graf"&gt;By this point in my experiment, I’d built decent stamina walking. That is, until I tried to walk on the beach. The resistance of the sand and slope of the shore had my calves burning within the first few minutes of walking. At what I thought had to be the halfway point, I looked down at my phone to find that I’d been walking for a whopping seven minutes. I felt defeated, but persevered, breaking that walk into half-hour intervals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-eb9e18" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9ac4b2" class="body-graf"&gt;By week four, I was over this walking experiment. The benefits you read about really are there. But I wanted my lazy mornings back in the worst way. Every morning, I had to convince myself not to quit or skip a day here and there. On the flip side, I was in a great mood every morning when I came back from my walk. I was happy that I’d gone. I was walking much more easily and my speed was noticeably faster. During week 4, I hit three miles for the first time. I reminded my pre-walk self about that post-walk feeling every day during this week. The day after I completed my one-month experiment, I spent the entire day sitting on my couch watching movies with my cat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-3b110f"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2000" data-original-width="2000"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/walking-1-hour-a-day-zz-250728-01-b94cab.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/walking-1-hour-a-day-zz-250728-01-b94cab.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/walking-1-hour-a-day-zz-250728-01-b94cab.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/walking-1-hour-a-day-zz-250728-01-b94cab.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/walking-1-hour-a-day-zz-250728-01-b94cab.jpg" alt="Danielle Page before and after."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Page lost a few pounds and inches, but it was the non-scale victories that she was most surprised to feel. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Danielle Page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-103030" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Result: 5 Pounds Down and Mood Way Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-72600a" class="body-graf"&gt;I waited until the end of the experiment to weigh myself again, out of fear that I hadn’t lost any weight. When I weighed in, I was shocked to see the scale read 144.6. I’d also lost an inch off my chest and an inch off my thighs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d7381e" class="body-graf"&gt;The weight loss was nice, but it wasn’t the best part of this experiment — it was feeling so much better overall. There’s unfortunately no magic pill to get better sleep, mood, energy and focus — but walking an hour a day is a pretty low lift way to achieve these things. Something I’ve been trying to remember post-experiment when I don’t feel like going on another walk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 20:00:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxPVERDd2hoWHpOa1N6MDZqS3lUclVTRGkxWWVobzJPYW12OWpRSjRaQkI0Ny15NFpzRHJMVjFWbnhyczNncWxkMmhsUXFwQXBZTVdnQ2pKdDJocnYzdlJ3aVQ1OE5YUm1iYVBhX3NudjY0SVh0X1IwVkxkMl9hYUIzUmJhY0tkMWM3RC1fX010NFlmNGRSaDhIbG5uTdIBVEFVX3lxTE56SFo5cmlDMzRYQkp3Z2xINGtXVFowQ3dzbnhxQVZIUV9CRnVHRV9iTXRSTG5pMF9UVURkRGtQSlhhYWtaNk44c21IUkh3Y3ktT1Jqcg</guid></item><item><title>拒绝化疗后死亡的女性每日咖啡灌肠- BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9vdWZ3SkNCQ2FBNERQbmhkYzJrUDdwbFdGSXhEZE95WXhjOFFFUlZxaUUzSTNtSGxSZ19YY2x3S0FNU1lZNVJ2Z25WYjE0eG52S0Fyd0UwaXQ4UdIBX0FVX3lxTE5iR21VOFdGa0xpWUI5ejdyLWZFbEwzb195dFJGSGxhSFltRVh3Ymt6RVV2dGlRZ05ZcHJJQTA1bno2eVN3bXhwZnpxalRSZFQwdUQ4NGNid2lTek9hbW5r?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;Woman who refused chemo and died had coffee enemas&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-801dd632-0 eSlECZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-801dd632-12 jSIeFi"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-801dd632-5 kRoBHa"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-7 lasLGY"&gt;Nathan Bevan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-801dd632-8 hwLppI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC News, South East&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ec67/live/aef4efe0-4eaa-11f0-9e07-7900e9cdda16.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ec67/live/aef4efe0-4eaa-11f0-9e07-7900e9cdda16.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ec67/live/aef4efe0-4eaa-11f0-9e07-7900e9cdda16.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ec67/live/aef4efe0-4eaa-11f0-9e07-7900e9cdda16.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ec67/live/aef4efe0-4eaa-11f0-9e07-7900e9cdda16.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ec67/live/aef4efe0-4eaa-11f0-9e07-7900e9cdda16.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ec67/live/aef4efe0-4eaa-11f0-9e07-7900e9cdda16.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ec67/live/aef4efe0-4eaa-11f0-9e07-7900e9cdda16.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Gabriel &amp;amp; Sebastian Shemirani Paloma, pictured in what looks like a flash photo from a film camera, with her face brightly lit smiling in the centre of the frame, her hair in long blond curls, wearing a coat with a furry hood and with something in leopard print faux-fur around her shoulders.

While it doesn’t imply that people with psychiatric diagnoses are more prone to hate, the overlap suggests that online hate speech may cultivate traits like low empathy and emotional instability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posts from communities for personality disorders had the most linguistic similarity to hate speech groups. These findings may inform future interventions by adapting therapeutic strategies typically used for managing such disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speech Overlap:&lt;/strong&gt; Hate speech communities shared linguistic traits with Cluster B personality disorder communities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Diagnostic Link:&lt;/strong&gt; The study does not claim individuals with mental illness are more hateful—only that language patterns are similar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Insights could guide new strategies for countering hate speech using mental health approaches.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PLOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new analysis suggests that posts in hate speech communities on the social media website Reddit share speech-pattern similarities with posts in Reddit communities for certain psychiatric disorders. Dr. Andrew William Alexander and Dr. Hongbin Wang of Texas A&amp;amp;M University, U.S., present these findings July 29&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in the open-access journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS Digital Health&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ubiquity of social media has raised concerns about its role in spreading hate speech and misinformation, potentially contributing to prejudice, discrimination and real-world violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112000"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and online forum chat bubbles." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The authors suggest their findings could help inform new strategies to combat online hate speech and misinformation, such as treating them using elements of therapy developed for psychiatric disorders. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior research has uncovered associations between certain personality traits and the act of posting online hate speech or misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, whether any associations exist between psychological wellbeing and online hate speech or misinformation has been unclear. To help clarify, Alexander and Wang used artificial intelligence tools to analyze posts from 54 Reddit communities relevant to hate speech, misinformation, psychiatric disorders, or, for neutral comparison, none of those categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selected groups included r/ADHD, a community for discussing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, r/NoNewNormal, dedicated to COVID-19 misinformation, and r/Incels, a community banned for hate speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used the large-language model GPT3 to convert thousands of posts from these communities into numerical representations capturing the posts’ underlying speech patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These representations, or “embeddings,” could then be analyzed through machine-learning techniques and a mathematical approach known as topological data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This analysis showed that speech patterns in hate speech communities were similar to speech patterns in communities for complex post-traumatic stress disorder, and borderline, narcissistic and antisocial personality disorders. Links between misinformation and psychiatric disorders were less clear, but with some connections to anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these findings do not at all suggest that people with psychiatric disorders are more prone to hate speech or misinformation. For one, there was no way of knowing if the analyzed posts were made by people actually diagnosed with disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to understand the links and explore such possibilities as hate speech communities mimicking speech patterns seen in psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors suggest their findings could help inform new strategies to combat online hate speech and misinformation, such as treating them using elements of therapy developed for psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors add, “Our results show that the speech patterns of those participating in hate speech online have strong underlying similarities with those participating in communities for individuals with certain psychiatric disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chief among these are the Cluster B personality disorders: Narcissistic Personality Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder, and Borderline Personality Disorder. These disorders are generally known for either lack of empathy/regard towards the wellbeing of others, or difficulties managing anger and relationships with others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander notes, “While we looked for similarities between misinformation and psychiatric disorder speech patterns as well, the connections we found were far weaker. Besides a potential anxiety component, I think it is safe to say at this point in time that most people buying into or spreading misinformation are actually quite healthy from a psychiatric standpoint.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander concludes, “I want to emphasize that these results do not mean that individuals with psychiatric conditions are more likely to engage in hate speech. Instead, it suggests that people who engage in hate speech online tend to have similar speech patterns to those with cluster B personality disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It could be that the lack of empathy for others fostered by hate speech influences people over time and causes them to exhibit traits similar to those seen in Cluster B personality disorders, at least with regards to the target of their hate speech. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While further studies would be needed to confirm this, I think it is a good indicator that exposing ourselves to these types of communities for long periods of time is not healthy and can make us less empathetic towards others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;AWA was a Burroughs Wellcome Fund Scholar supported by a Burroughs Wellcome Fund Physician Scientist Institutional Award (G-1020069) to the Texas A&amp;amp;M University Academy of Physician Scientists (https://www.bwfund.org/funding-opportunities/biomedical-sciences/physician-scientist-institutional-award/grant-recipients/).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.

In this study, we collected thousands of posts from carefully selected communities on the social media site Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then utilized OpenAI’s GPT3 to derive embeddings of these posts, which are high-dimensional real-numbered vectors that presumably represent the hidden semantics of posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then performed various machine-learning classifications based on these embeddings in order to identify potential similarities between hate speech/misinformation speech patterns and those of various communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, a topological data analysis (TDA) was applied to the embeddings to obtain a visual map connecting online hate speech, misinformation, various psychiatric disorders, and general mental health.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 19:41:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxOUF9zeGkzaE5CX0VyR0ZxbU80aTNJalMwR0VOd3BPdnNsc2VwckRTNHVFYUM2SWExdjdvVFhXeHd0cUFpZ1B4OUZSd2t3bkpSdHllc0lKQmFpMTJKWmU4NFRzQ3pCY2RLeUVoRG52c0dVc3lUb1pSQVc4Tk1RQjlJQw</guid></item><item><title>1亿美国人服用的最常见的止痛药可能会使您更容易作弊和吸毒-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The world’s most popular pain reliever may cause people to take more risks and reduce fear around risky decisions, leading to bolder behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly a quarter of Americans take acetaminophen, known around the world as paracetamol, weekly and data estimates 100million Americans take it annually. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recently, scientists &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14567929/Experts-issue-warning-worlds-common-painkiller-bizarre-unexpected-effect.html"&gt;have been investigating&lt;/a&gt; how it might influence &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14567929/Experts-issue-warning-worlds-common-painkiller-bizarre-unexpected-effect.html"&gt;people's behavior&lt;/a&gt; on a larger scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To measure the effects of acetaminophen - the active ingredient in Tylenol -researchers from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/ohio/index.html" id="mol-e57f0750-6c7b-11f0-b899-97c7884526fb"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; State University had over 500 college students participate in a risk-taking game. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some participants received a normal dose of acetaminophen, 1,000 mg, mirroring standard over-the-counter use, while others received a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the game, they inflated a virtual balloon to earn cash rewards. If it burst, they lost everything. The acetaminophen group pumped more aggressively and popped more balloons, suggesting they cared less about the risk of losing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In follow-up surveys, those on acetaminophen rated activities like bungee jumping or gambling as less risky than the placebo group, but only when the scenarios were emotionally charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers warned that while the changes in risk-taking are subtle, they’re worth watching, mainly because acetaminophen is found in over 600 medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Acetaminophen is the active pain reliever in Tylenol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study suggested that acetaminophen’s effect on risk-taking behavior likely goes beyond just dulling fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The over-the-counter drug may also alter deeper cognitive and neurological processes, including by turning off the brain’s alarm signals for danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It may also reduce awareness of one’s mistakes, and quiet a part of the brain that gives someone a gut feeling that danger is close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Baldwin Way, co-author of the 2020 study and associate professor of psychology at Ohio State University, said: ‘Acetaminophen seems to make people feel less negative emotion when they consider risky activities – they just don’t feel as scared.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Way conducted three experiments in his report, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/15/7/725/5897711?login=false"&gt;Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Across these studies, 545 undergraduate students took part in a task developed in 2002 that is often used by researchers to measure risk-taking behavior: inflating a balloon in exchange for cash rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They can stop at any time, bank the money, and move on to the next balloon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The people who took acetaminophen pumped more and more, despite the risk of the balloon popping and losing all their money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the balloon-popping game, people who took acetaminophen pumped 32 times compared to 29 times in the placebo group, and had more bursts, with 8.5 in the acetaminophen group compared to 7.9 in the placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nearly a quarter of Americans take acetaminophen - the active ingredient in Tylenol - weekly and data estimates 100million Americans take it annually (stock photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above compares results of people who took acetaminophen versus those who were given the placebo in risk-taking games&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Way said: ‘If you’re risk-averse, you may pump a few times and then decide to cash out because you don’t want the balloon to burst and lose your money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But for those who are on acetaminophen, as the balloon gets bigger, we believe they have less anxiety and less negative emotion about how big the balloon is getting and the possibility of it bursting.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research by Dr Way on the effects of acetaminophen on people’s behavior has suggested that it dulls positive and negative emotions, including hurt feelings, distress over another person’s suffering, and their joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He posited in his latest research that the medicine reduces anticipatory anxiety. Typically, as the balloon expands, people feel growing anxiety about it bursting, making them stop pumping earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drug may blunt this nervous feeling, though, causing people to take more risks.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And according to Dr Way, ‘increased risk-taking could have important effects on society.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With a dampened feeling of fear, anxiety and negative emotions, people may be more likely to partake in risky behavior, including cheating on partners, drinking excessively and taking drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two Gut Bacteria May Hold the Key to Multiple Sclerosis—But Don't Get Too Excited Yet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly a million Americans wake up each day with multiple sclerosis, a disease that turns their own immune system against their brain and spinal cord. For decades, researchers have suspected that something in the gut might trigger this autoimmune assault. Now, a clever twin study has fingered two specific bacterial culprits: &lt;em&gt;Eisenbergiella tayi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lachnoclostridium&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research, &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2419689122" target="_blank"&gt;published in PNAS&lt;/a&gt;, used 81 pairs of identical twins where only one sibling had MS. It's an elegant approach—same genes, different outcomes. The German-led team found these two bacteria lurking in higher numbers in the small intestines of the twins with MS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here's where it gets interesting. They didn't stop at correlation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Gut to Brain: The Mouse Test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers transplanted gut bacteria from the twins into specially bred mice prone to MS-like disease. The results were stark: mice getting bacteria from MS twins developed paralysis within twelve weeks. Those getting microbes from healthy twins stayed mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Female mice were hit harder—matching the real-world pattern where &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/multiple-sclerosis/facts-statistics-infographic" target="_blank"&gt;women are three times more likely&lt;/a&gt; to develop MS than men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;E. tayi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lachnoclostridium&lt;/em&gt; belong to the Lachnospiraceae family, typically harmless fiber-digesters. What makes these two troublemakers different isn't clear yet, but they can feast on mucus when fiber runs low—potentially thinning the intestinal barrier and exposing immune cells to inflammatory signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bigger Picture: MS by the Numbers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis affects &lt;a href="https://atlasofms.org/" target="_blank"&gt;2.9 million people worldwide&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/multiple-sclerosis/facts-statistics-infographic" target="_blank"&gt;nearly one million in the US alone&lt;/a&gt;. It typically strikes in the prime of life—average diagnosis age is 32—when people are building careers and starting families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disease is unpredictable. About 85% start with relapsing-remitting MS, where symptoms flare and fade. Without treatment, roughly half progress to secondary progressive MS within a decade, where disability steadily accumulates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current treatments can slow progression but can't cure the disease or reverse damage. That's why finding specific bacterial triggers matters—it offers a concrete target instead of trying to re-engineer the entire gut ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reality Check: Breakthrough or False Dawn?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn't the first time researchers have linked gut bacteria to MS. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28893994/" target="_blank"&gt;Previous studies&lt;/a&gt; found similar patterns with different bacterial players. The field is littered with promising leads that didn't pan out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several red flags warrant caution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The mouse problem&lt;/strong&gt;: MS-like disease in mice isn't MS in humans. Countless therapies that worked in rodents have failed in clinical trials. The immune systems are different, the gut environments are different, and lab mice live in sterile bubbles unlike the microbial chaos of human guts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sample size&lt;/strong&gt;: 81 twin pairs sounds impressive, but it's still relatively small for drawing broad conclusions about a complex disease affecting millions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Causation vs. correlation&lt;/strong&gt;: Even with the mouse experiments, we can't be certain these bacteria &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; MS rather than simply thriving in the inflammatory environment MS creates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The replication challenge&lt;/strong&gt;: Independent teams need to confirm these findings in different populations. Science is littered with exciting results that couldn't be reproduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Path Forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this research holds up, the therapeutic possibilities are intriguing. Targeted antibiotics, designer bacteriophages, or engineered probiotics could potentially eliminate the troublesome bacteria while leaving beneficial microbes alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early trials of high-fiber diets have shown modest benefits in MS patients—possibly by keeping mucus-eating bacteria occupied with safer food sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But any gut-targeted therapy will need to navigate the complex ecosystem of beneficial bacteria that support vitamin synthesis and immune regulation. Broad-spectrum antibiotics sometimes worsen autoimmune diseases, highlighting the delicate balance involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This twin study represents solid, methodical science. The researchers controlled for genetics, used functional testing in mice, and identified specific bacterial species rather than vague "microbiome imbalances."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it's one study, using mouse models, with a modest sample size. The history of MS research is filled with promising leads that ultimately led nowhere. Remember when researchers were convinced MS was caused by a virus? Or when they thought it was purely genetic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The smart money says this research will spawn follow-up studies, some confirming the findings, others contradicting them. That's how science works—messy, incremental, often disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the million Americans living with MS, this offers hope for new treatment approaches. But it's not a breakthrough yet—it's a promising lead that needs years of additional research to prove its worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gut-brain connection in autoimmune disease is real. Whether these two bacterial species are key players or bit characters in a much larger drama remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Hancock County resident has been hospitalized with the first human case of Powassan virus infection recorded by the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention this year. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The adult was experiencing neurologic symptoms, according to the Maine CDC. The Powassan virus is spread through deer or woodchuck tick bites, and can infect a bitten person in just 15 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some people who contract Powassan virus do not show any symptoms, while others may experience a fever and flu-like illness. More severe symptoms include seizures, memory loss or brain or spinal cord inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For more information on Powassan virus, including prevention and detection, visit the Maine CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/epi/vector-borne/powassan/index.shtml"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/epi/vector-borne/powassan/index.shtml"&gt;Powassan virus website&lt;/a&gt;. Visit the &lt;a href="https://extension.umaine.edu/ticks/"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://extension.umaine.edu/ticks/"&gt;UMaine Tick Lab&lt;/a&gt; for more information about tick identification and testing.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The Maine CDC said Tuesday that it had also recorded its first known case of a West Nile virus infection in a wild bird. The crow infected with the virus was discovered in York County. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The development and symptoms of West Nile are similar to those of the Powassan virus infection, and more information can be found at the &lt;a href="https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/news/maine-cdc-prepares-active-mosquito-season-mon-06302025-1200"&gt;Maine CDC website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid contracting a viral infection is to prevent tick and mosquito bites. This includes wearing long sleeves and high socks when working outdoors; tucking your pant legs into your socks; use insect repellent that contains DEET, picaridin, or another &lt;a href="https://www.maine.gov/dacf/php/gotpests/bugs/mosquito.htm#:~:text=Information%20on%20Insect%20Repellents"&gt;EPA-approved repellent&lt;/a&gt;; check for ticks in areas including your armpits, the back of your knees and your crotch after being outside; and draining any standing bodies of water, such as bird baths or splash pools, that could serve as mosquito breeding grounds. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last year Maine saw a &lt;a href="https://www.bangordailynews.com/2025/01/02/homestead/maine-tick-borne-disease-record-2024/"&gt;record number&lt;/a&gt; of tickborne diseases with &lt;a href="https://data.mainepublichealth.gov/tracking/tickborne"&gt;3,218 cases&lt;/a&gt; of Lyme disease reported between January and December, along with a rise in other lesser-known diseases. &lt;/p&gt;

Fewer than 10 cases are reported each year in the U.S., but &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/article/health-52f7e46efac248b6998edee89e052b27"&gt;almost all are fatal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Here are some things to know about the amoeba, its latest victim and other dangers on freshwater lakes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The amoeba's scientific name is Naegleria fowleri and it is most dangerous in very warm water, including in lakes and rivers in the southern part of the U.S. and other places with hot, sometimes dry summers like Pakistan and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The amoeba enters the brain through the olfactory nerve in the nose. Once inside, it causes an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Symptoms start as a fairly standard headache and nausea. By the time the pain becomes severe, it is almost always too late to save the infected person. Of the 167 cases reported in the U.S. between 1962 and 2024, only four people have survived, according to the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/naegleria/media/pdfs/naegleria_factsheet508c.pdf"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the deaths happened within five days of getting sick, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Jaysen Carr went swimming at Lake Murray about 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Columbia over the July Fourth weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He got sick several days later and died on July 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;His father and mother had never heard of the amoeba before a doctor in tears told them what tests of his spinal fluid had found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Clarence Carr said he was shocked to learn South Carolina, like most other U.S. states, has no law requiring public reporting of deaths or infections from the amoeba. The lake wasn’t closed and no water testing was performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“My son was a very smart individual. If he had one warning, he would have thought swimming in the lake was a bad idea,” Carr said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The amoeba is fairly common and is most dangerous when the water is warm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Researchers are trying to figure out why the infections are so rare. Some people have been found to have had antibodies, signalling they may have survived exposure. Others may die from brain swelling and other problems without the amoeba ever being detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“My son lost his life swimming. We assumed it was safe,” Carr said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The amoeba can show up in hot springs, rivers and, on rare occasions, in tap water. That’s why doctors recommend using sterile water for cleaning nasal passages with a neti pot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The only way to be completely safe is to not swim in lakes or rivers and, if you do, keep your head above water. Pinching your nose or using nose clips when diving or swimming can keep water out of your nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;There are other dangers in swimming in lakes and rivers instead of pools, where chemicals can kill off dangerous bacteria and other organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;A mouthful of water could contain E.coli bacteria. And while the bacteria normally live in the intestines of healthy people and animals, some strains can cause a range of conditions, including urinary tract infection, cystitis, intestinal infection and vomiting, with the worst cases leading to life-threatening blood poisoning, according to &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/e-coli/symptoms-causes/syc-20372058"&gt;the Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Algae can also cause illnesses.

            &lt;p&gt;COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Two weeks after Jaysen Carr spent the Fourth of July swimming and riding on a boat on one of South Carolina’s most popular lakes, he was dead from an amoeba that lives in the warm water and entered his brain through his nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong class="whatsapp-promotion-mobile"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His parents had no clue the brain-eating amoeba, whose scientific name is Naegleria fowleri, even existed in Lake Murray, just 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found out when a doctor, in tears, told them the diagnosis after what seemed like a fairly regular headache and nausea took a serious turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaysen, 12, fought for a week before dying on July 18, making him one of about 160 people known to have died from the amoeba in the U.S. in the past 60 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they grieve their son, the boy’s parents said they were stunned to learn South Carolina, like most other U.S. states, has no law requiring public reporting of deaths or infections from the amoeba. The lake wasn’t closed and no water testing was performed. If they hadn’t spoken up, they wonder if anyone would have even known what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can’t believe we don’t have our son. The result of him being a child was losing his life. That does not sit well. And I am terrified it will happen to someone else,” Clarence Carr told The Associated Press as his wife sat beside him, hugging a stuffed tiger that had a recording of their middle child’s heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best Fourth of July ever&lt;br&gt;
Jaysen loved sports. He played football and baseball. He loved people, too. As soon as he met you, he was your friend, his father said. He was smart enough to have skipped a grade in school and to play several instruments in his middle school band in Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He either loved you or he just didn’t know you,” his father said. “He was the type of person who could go to a jump park and five minutes later say, ‘This is my friend James.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friends invited Jaysen and his family for the Fourth of July holiday weekend on the lake, where Jaysen spent hours swimming, fishing and riding on an inner tube that was being pulled by a boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mom and Dad, that was the best Fourth of July I’ve ever had,” Clarence Carr remembered his son telling him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A headache suddenly gets worse&lt;br&gt;
A few days later, Jaysen’s head started to hurt. Pain relievers helped. But the next day the headache got worse and he started throwing up. He told the emergency room doctors exactly where he was hurting. But soon he started to get disoriented and lethargic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba was in his brain, already causing an infection and destroying brain tissue. It entered through his nose as water was forced deep into his nasal passages, possibly from one of the times Jaysen jumped into the water. It then traveled along his olfactory nerve into his brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba caused an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis. Fewer than 10 people a year get it in the U.S., and over 95% of them die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba is fairly common. Researchers are still trying to figure out why the infections are so rare. Some people have been found to have had antibodies, signalling they may have survived exposure. Others may die from brain swelling and other problems without the amoeba ever being detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba is found in warm water and the infection is almost always fatal&lt;br&gt;
The amoeba becomes dangerous in very warm water and for years has been seen almost exclusively in the summer in the southern part of the country. But a few recent cases have popped up in Maryland, Indiana and Minnesota, scientists said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC said 167 cases of the infection have been reported in the U.S. between 1962 and 2024, and only four people have survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boys seem most susceptible, but researchers don’t know if that is simply because they are more likely to jump and dive into the water or play in sediment at the bottom of lakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba can show up in hot springs, rivers and, on rare occasions, in tap water. That’s why doctors recommend using sterile water for cleaning nasal passages with a neti pot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to be completely safe is to not swim in lakes or rivers and, if you do, keep your head above water. Pinching your nose or using nose clips when diving or swimming can keep water out of your nose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents want others to know the danger from the brain-eating amoeba&lt;br&gt;
As he sat in an intensive care hospital room with his son, Clarence Carr couldn’t help but think of all the people on the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wondered if any of them had any clue about the microscopic danger in that water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are entire families out there on pontoon boats, jumping off, just like our kids were having the time of their lives,” he said. “It very well could be their last moments, and they are unaware of it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Alzheimer’s Association, in its first clinical guidelines on blood biomarker testing, said Tuesday that tests that have over 90% sensitivity (ability to identify positive results) and 90% specificity (ability to identify negative results) can be used instead of current diagnostic methods like PET scans and cerebrospinal fluid tests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The group said that tests that have over 90% sensitivity and 75% specificity can be used to triage patients, meaning negative results rule can rule out Alzheimer’s with high probability but positive results should be confirmed with the standard diagnostic methods, given that these blood tests have a higher likelihood of false positives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors stressed that the guidelines should not be considered a substitute for a full clinical evaluation and that they apply only to people who are in the care of specialists and have already been confirmed to have cognitive impairment. The authors also noted that there’s wide variability in the blood tests on the market and that many do not meet the accuracy thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They did not endorse specific tests, but reviewed dozens that measured biomarkers such as pTau217, the ratio of pTau217 to non-pTau217, and the ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40. They will post a chart of the various tests and their accuracy in an online portal that will be continually updated, said Rebecca Edelmayer, one of the guidelines’ authors and vice president of scientific engagement at the Alzheimer’s Association. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The approval of new Alzheimer’s drugs in recent years has &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/07/25/alzheimers-blood-test-diagnostics-leqembi/"&gt;ignited a race&lt;/a&gt; to roll out blood tests as a more convenient and cheaper way for patients to get diagnosed, and so far the Food and Drug Administration has &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/16/alzheimers-fujirebio-fda-approval/"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; one test. But up until now, doctors haven’t had clear guidelines on when to use them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the recommendations are expected to be updated over time, even the first stab could lead to more patients getting tested and diagnosed, particularly in rural areas, where access to scans and spinal fluid tests are typically more difficult to access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think this is reasonable. They’ve really thought through this very carefully in terms of making a diagnosis,” said Joseph Quinn, a professor of neurology at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University who was not involved in writing the guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s still best for patients who plan to start treatment to receive PET scans first, said Stephen Salloway, a professor of neurology at Brown University who was not involved with the guidelines. New therapies from Eisai, Biogen, and Eli Lilly aim to shrink a plaque in the brain called amyloid that’s thought to be linked to Alzheimer’s, and doctors, if possible, should scan patients not only before treatment but throughout treatment to ensure that the amyloid is shrinking, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The blood tests can detect whether patients are positive or negative for amyloid, but are not reliable measures of how much amyloid is in their brain, said Salloway, who has consulted for drug companies making Alzheimer’s treatments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The recommendations do not address how to use blood tests in the course of monitoring patients receiving treatment. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Drugmakers have supported the development of blood tests, and Lilly has been trying to make it easier for patients to get diagnosed, recently striking an &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/27/eli-lilly-alzheimers-disease-telemedicine-synapticure/"&gt;agreement&lt;/a&gt; with a telehealth provider in which it connects patients to a virtual platform so they can get a diagnosis if necessary and get a prescription for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To make the guidelines, the authors reviewed close to 50 studies. They excluded studies that analyzed populations of people who both did and didn’t have cognitive impairment, since they wanted to focus only on those with cognitive impairment. They only evaluated tests that used a single threshold that determined positive or negative results. And they also rated how certain the evidence was for each test’s accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The guidelines also serve as a “call to action” for researchers to understand how to conduct studies and publish results in a way for the Alzheimer’s Association to deem the tests as having strong evidence backing them up, said Edelmayer.&lt;/p&gt;

                 &lt;div class="post_text"&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By COLlive reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A case of measles has been confirmed in a dormitory associated with the Central Yeshiva Tomchei Tmimim Lubavitch – 770 Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights, prompting urgent health guidance from the ODA Crown Heights Health Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patient, a young Yeshiva bochur from Israel currently studying in the “Kevutza” program at 770, was officially diagnosed earlier on Tuesday with the highly contagious virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The risk of a large-scale outbreak is real,” stated the medical team at ODA in a public health text message to its patients at 1:19 PM on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ODA didn’t disclose whether this bochur was a resident of the dormitories at 749 Eastern Parkway, 755 Eastern Parkway, 1414 President Street, 1214 Sterling Place, or another in the neighborhood. A medical source told COLlive it was the 755 dormitory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Please ensure all children and young adults are vaccinated with MMR. Watch for symptoms: fever, rash, cough, conjunctivitis, and diarrhea,” the ODA wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is an illness that spreads through respiratory droplets and can cause high fever, cough, rash, conjunctivitis (red eyes), and diarrhea. It can also lead to serious complications, especially in young children and those with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ODA Health Center, located at 779 East New York Avenue, added, “If visiting a medical facility with these signs, call ahead so the case can be properly managed and exposure minimized.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents were advised to review their family’s vaccination records and contact their doctor or the ODA Health Center with any concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For appointments or questions, contact the ODA Crown Heights Health Center at (718) 260-4670.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many people think that dementia is only a concern later in life, but the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8055902/healthy-habits-to-help-you-live-longer/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;habits and lifestyle choices&lt;/a&gt; we make today quietly shape our brain health and can influence our future risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One habit that’s become increasingly common in modern life is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-break-to-reduce-dementia-risk-11682107" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;spending most of the day sitting&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But why does this happen? We dive into the details below and provide expert-backed tips to reduce your risk of developing dementia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-a-sedentary-lifestyle-can-increase-dementia-risk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why a Sedentary Lifestyle Can Increase Dementia Risk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Increases Insulin Resistance and Type 2 Diabetes Risk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Inactivity is closely linked to insulin resistance and the development of type 2 diabetes, which are well-established risk factors for both vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s disease,” says Robinson.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Insulin resistance occurs when the body becomes less sensitive to insulin, a hormone that helps move glucose (sugar) from the bloodstream into cells.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Robinson explains that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8001377/having-diabetes-can-speed-up-cognitive-decline-here-are-5-things-you-can-do-to-help/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;poor glucose control damages blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; and disrupts insulin signaling in the brain, impairing the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to brain cells. Over time, this can impair cognition.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These metabolic changes may &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/alzheimers-exercise-study-11691515" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;increase the buildup of harmful proteins like beta-amyloid&lt;/a&gt;, which are linked with neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Associated with Heart Disease &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A sedentary lifestyle can increase the risk of dementia in part due to its connection with cardiovascular disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Prolonged sitting and low physical activity levels are linked to increased risk of hypertension (high blood pressure), stroke and other cardiovascular diseases, all of which are major risk factors for vascular dementia,” explains Robinson.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chronically elevated blood pressure strains the heart and damages blood vessels, including the small vessels that supply the brain. Over time, this can lead to strokes and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-of-cognitive-decline-11767736" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cognitive decline, including difficulty with memory and thinking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It May Reduce Brain Volume &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spending too much time sitting may also increase dementia risk by gradually &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-are-aging-your-brain-11717608" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;shrinking brain volume in areas tied to memory and learning&lt;/a&gt;. Studies have found that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/activity-to-limit-for-reduced-risk-dementia-8548330" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;sedentary behaviors are linked to reduced gray matter&lt;/a&gt; in brain regions like the hippocampus, which plays a crucial role in forming memories and recalling past experiences.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; What’s even more surprising is that being physically active may not offset the risks of spending the rest of the day sedentary. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, one study found that high amounts of sedentary time were linked to greater cognitive decline, even among those who exercised regularly. The risk was even higher in people with the APOE-e4 gene variation, a known risk factor for dementia.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This highlights the importance of not only exercising regularly, but &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8074778/habit-to-break-for-a-longer-life/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;minimizing sitting time throughout the day&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fortunately, there are ways you can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dementia-risk-doubling-study-8776659" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower your risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;. Robinson shares the following &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-doctors-do-every-day-for-better-brain-health-11678638" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;daily habits you can incorporate into your routine&lt;/a&gt; to help keep your mind sharp.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Moving. &lt;/strong&gt;Be intentional with movement, and exercise regularly. “For example, use stairs instead of the elevator, park farther away and walk during meetings or phone calls. Aim to engage in 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week and break up long periods of sitting with light movement,” says Robinson.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try the MIND Diet. &lt;/strong&gt;The &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290813/mind-diet-best-foods-to-eat-to-keep-your-brain-young/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;MIND diet&lt;/a&gt; is a blend of the Mediterranean and DASH diets, which are eating patterns that may reduce the risk of dementia. “Studies show that the MIND diet is associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline or impairment. Even moderate adherence to the MIND diet could significantly lower a person’s risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease,” explains Robinson.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Munch on Berries. &lt;/strong&gt;If there’s one group of fruits that is consistently celebrated for its brain&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;boosting benefits, it’s berries. Robinson emphasizes that “berries are rich in antioxidants, which can help fight oxidative stress that contributes to age-related memory decline. Research shows that regular berry consumption (especially blueberries, strawberries and blackberries) may delay cognitive aging and decrease the risk of dementia.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; She suggests tossing them into smoothies, oatmeal or yogurt for a brain-smart start to the day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat Healthy Fats. &lt;/strong&gt;A few of the top sources of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-for-brain-health-as-you-age-11739345" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;brain-healthy fats are nuts, olive oil and fatty fish&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Include nuts most days, cook with extra-virgin olive oil and eat fatty fish (like salmon or sardines). These foods provide omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E, which are protective against cognitive decline,” Robinson shares.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Our lifestyle habits play a powerful role in shaping the future of our brain health. One often-overlooked factor for dementia is a sedentary lifestyle, which is associated with insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease and reduced brain volume. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A new scientific study, published this month in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61033-4"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, has revealed that the pandemic may have accelerated brain aging in people even if they were never infected with the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Researchers at the University of Nottingham in the UK analyzed brain images captured before and after the onset of the health crisis. The scientists found that the brains of those who lived through the pandemic appeared to age faster over its duration compared to those whose brains were only scanned prior to March 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“What surprised me most was that even people who hadn’t had Covid showed significant increases in brain aging rates,” said Ali-Reza Mohammadi-Nejad, a coauthor of the study, in a &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age"}' href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; on the university’s website. “It really shows how much the experience of the pandemic itself, everything from isolation to uncertainty, may have affected our brain health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The team used longitudinal data from the &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/about-our-data/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/about-our-data/"}' href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/about-our-data/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt;, a huge dataset that is periodically collecting biological information from roughly half a million people over a long period of time and which includes MRI scans of nearly 1,000 adults. Of these people, some had received two scans before the pandemic (the control group), while others had one before and one after confinement and health restrictions had been implemented in response to the viral outbreak (the “pandemic” group).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“The longitudinal MRI data acquired before and after the pandemic from the UK Biobank gave us a rare window to observe how such a major life event can affect the brain,” said Stamatios Sotiropoulos, professor of computational neuroimaging at the University of Nottingham and a coauthor of the study, in a &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age"}' href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;To estimate each person’s “brain age,” the researchers trained a machine-learning model on more than 15,000 healthy volunteers without chronic diseases to allow them to determine how much older or younger a brain looked relative to its chronological age. They then used this tool to assess the ages of the MRI brain scans in the two Biobank groups. When looking at the second scans in each group, the mean difference between chronological and measured age was 5.5 months higher in the pandemic group compared to the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The researchers also found that this acceleration of brain aging was more marked in older people, men, and those from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds, such as those with low educational levels, precarious jobs, or housing and health difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“This study reminds us that brain health is shaped not only by illness but by our everyday environment,” said Dorothee Auer, lead author of the study, in in &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age"}' href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; released by the University of Nottingham. “The pandemic put a strain on people’s lives, especially those already facing disadvantage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Although brain aging was seen universally among those living through the pandemic, only those infected went on to show measurable cognitive impairment, a symptom of Covid that has been documented in the past. The study found that those in the pandemic group who had Covid between the two scans experienced a drop in performance in mental flexibility and processing speed tests. In contrast, those who were not infected showed no significant cognitive changes, suggesting that structural aging does not always translate into visible functional symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;However, the authors acknowledge that there are some important limitations to this observational study, which could bias the results. These include the interval of time between people’s scans differing between the two groups, as well as the UK Biobank lacking representation from the most marginalized sectors of the British population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The researchers also highlighted the possibility of reversibility, as only brain scans from two time points were analyzed, meaning that there may be neurological recovery in these people in subsequent years. “We don’t yet know if the observed changes can be reversed, but it is an encouraging idea,” Auer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://es.wired.com/articulos/la-pandemia-acelero-el-envejecimiento-del-cerebro-incluso-en-personas-que-nunca-se-enfermaron-de-covid"&gt;WIRED &lt;em&gt;en Español&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;and has been translated from Spanish.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 16:52:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxQaVdQbDljUHZRelhkTzVfdFYxVkRYSGVSblM1OVJpcVozNXN2dXgtOGQ1RkFOd3pMcW4tU1ExZXU0RlpqaEpqMjZ1bHZ4RmE1Nk5YVG5QeVlXNnpyTnBLVkdtV0wyR3l4UnVrbVRLV1d3bnlYdFpRalFzNWhLZ3J1cVlZTXJKb1RCZlllSHdvVUJybm8tc21yRXJ4eHd6U05IaHc</guid></item><item><title>大麻使用障碍口腔癌风险增加三倍-加州大学圣地亚哥分校今天</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxOamVqQnY5bWNWT1JMV2xPeWhZWjlLOHJOYnJYSkxGNmZfQ2RCNml5Tk9qcVdDQ3NwZm1LVlFSVnBudDFmTGNDNEUxakREY2lmR1I4NzRJNU9EQXotSjJiN3BGcXZRZ2NwMm16ZkhUSXcyTHptM3NpUXREU2owQkJoOTJZTUo?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="modal-body px-6-5 pb-7"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People often assume that long-term friendship means unconditional loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when one person starts healing and the other resists change, things can &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1lane5n/aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_of_20_years_to/"&gt;turn toxic fast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read on for the full story!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;AITA for telling my best friend of 20 years to get therapy?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I (34F) have been friends with my best friend (33F) since we trauma bonded at a summer camp for troubled teens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, she’s put in a lot of effort to improve her mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was later diagnosed with BPD (borderline personality disorder), and I take medication and go to weekly therapy for emotional regulation behavioral therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she can’t quite say the same for her friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, in the last few years—especially since my kid was born—I’ve noticed my BFF displaying signs of emotional codependency that I am no longer comfortable supporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told her I think she’s being codependent and that I can’t sustain that dynamic along with single motherhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when she confronts her friends, things blow up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;She got upset and lashed out by insulting my therapy, saying I’m not a better person and that therapy must not be working for me because “I’m still mean to her.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I replied asking her not to discuss my therapy anymore since it is none of her business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two continue to argue back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We continued to have this fight on and off until I finally realized I can’t keep my friend, and that broke my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked her to please consider therapy because it is beneficial, and I felt like I was growing apart from her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when she wouldn’t even consider it, she began to lose patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;She laughed at me, saying, “Who’s codependent now?” and then argued she can’t afford therapy and that it was rude to keep bringing mine up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said I wasn’t—I reiterated that I wanted her to stop using my therapy like a weapon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when she started turning other friends against her, she decided to cut them both off for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;She did not respect that boundary and instead got a mutual friend to side with her, texting me that I’m bragging about my therapy and shoving it in her face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told both of them this felt like an emotional attack I couldn’t handle anymore and that I would be blocking them for my mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So AITA?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like these friends simply grew in opposite directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did Reddit think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps these friends have just outgrown each other.&lt;/p&gt;

While no one ever claimed sugar was &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; for you, it turns out that consuming sugar in some forms is actually healthier than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent scientific review published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831325000493" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Advances in Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Advances in Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;had researchers analyzing the different ways people consume sugar and found that drinking your sugar is worse than simply eating it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it's nearly impossible to avoid all sugar, but the study does suggest that people should be choosy about the way they consume sugar in the future. Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts:&lt;/strong&gt; Dena Champion, RDN, a dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center; Jessica Cording, RD, CDN, author of The Little Book of Game-Changers; Tara Gidus Collingwood, RDN, a sports nutrition consultant and owner of Tara Gidus Nutrition Consulting; Lisa Moskovitz, RD, CDN, CEO of NY Nutrition Group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the review find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the review, researchers crunched data from more than half a million people across the world who participated in 29 different studies, looking at their sugar consumption habits and overall health. The researchers found that people who had sugar through beverages (think: soda and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a46595751/fruit-juice-linked-to-weight-gain-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:juice;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;juice&lt;/a&gt;) consistently had a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those who didn't drink as much sugar. But people who ate sugar didn’t have the same link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were pretty wild. For every 12-ounce serving someone had of sugar-sweetened beverages a day, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes jumped up by 25 percent. For every 8-ounce serving of fruit juice they had a day, the risk increased by 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest that dietary sugar consumed as a beverage (sugar sweetened beverages and fruit juice) is associated with incident type 2 diabetes risk,” the researchers wrote in the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is sugar bad for your overall health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big concern here is &lt;em&gt;excess &lt;/em&gt;sugar, says &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/dena-champion" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dena Champion;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dena Champion&lt;/a&gt;, RDN, a dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. “Excess sugar can lead to increased weight gain and leave less room for healthy options,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excess sugar also raises the risk of heart disease, dental issues, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, says Tara Gidus Collingwood, RDN, a sports nutrition consultant and owner of &lt;a href="https://dietdiva.net/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tara Gidus Nutrition Consulting;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tara Gidus Nutrition Consulting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s okay to have a little sugar, says Lisa Moskovitz, RD, CDN, CEO of &lt;a href="https://www.nynutritiongroup.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NY Nutrition Group;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NY Nutrition Group&lt;/a&gt; and author of &lt;em&gt;The Core 3 Healthy Eating Plan&lt;/em&gt;. “While consuming sugar sporadically and in smaller portions poses no risk for the average healthy person, excessive consumption of added and refined sugar could affect your health over time,” she says. Not only can it cause the issues we already mentioned, but it can also increase the risk of bodily inflammation, which is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11592557/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:linked;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to a host of serious health conditions, like cancer, autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular issues, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is drinking sugar worse than eating it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the researchers established the link between type 2 diabetes risk and drinking sugary beverages, they didn’t dive into that exact cause-effect relationship. But there are some theories. “A lot has to do with the lack of protein, fat, and fiber,” says Jessica Cording, RD, CDN, author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.65533393%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Little Book of Game-Changers;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;The Little Book of Game-Changers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “If you’re drinking sugar, which is usually in the context of a sugar-sweetened beverage or juice, there’s nothing to slow down the breakdown of it.” Cue the blood sugar spike and crash. It’s also easy to have a lot of sugar in a short period of time when you drink it, she points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're drinking soda, you’ll likely take in more sugar at a faster rate than if you were to say, eat some ice cream, says Collingwood. And then there are serving sizes to consider. “Beverages often contain more sugar than a typical serving of a sweet food,” Collingwood says. “A 20-ounce soda can have 15 to 18 teaspoons of sugar.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the worst sugary drinks to avoid?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study called out sugar-sweetened beverages like soda and juice, points out Champion. “It may be wise to consume both with caution,” she says. Cording agrees. “I don’t recommend having a big sugar-sweetened soda, energy drink, or fruit juice, especially on its own,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of drinking fruit juice, Champion recommends eating the whole fruit (which is also more filling). “Avoid sodas, lemonade, or fruit punch whenever possible,” she says. If you’re craving something fizzy but want to avoid the sugar of soda, Champion suggests experimenting with sparkling water, fruit, and herbs. “Berries and mint go well together,” she points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, while it's probably not great to drink soda or juice regularly, Moskovitz says it's okay to drink it in moderation.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of Canadian scientists has discovered a surprising new way to improve blood sugar levels and reduce liver damage: by trapping a little-known fuel made by gut bacteria before they wreak havoc on the body.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The findings, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(25)00328-6" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/i&gt;, could open the door to new therapies to treat &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/metabolic+diseases/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;metabolic diseases&lt;/a&gt; like type 2 diabetes and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/fatty+liver+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;fatty liver disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at McMaster University, Université Laval and the University of Ottawa showed that a molecule produced by microbes in the gut can sneak into the bloodstream and fuel the liver to make more glucose and fat than necessary. But when researchers developed a way to trap this molecule in the gut before it enters the body, they saw dramatic improvements in blood sugar control and fatty liver disease in mice with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a new twist on a classic metabolic pathway," says Jonathan Schertzer, senior and corresponding author and professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences at McMaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've known for nearly a century that muscles and the liver exchange lactate and glucose—a process called the Cori cycle. What we've discovered is a new branch of that cycle, where &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gut+bacteria/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt; are also part of the conversation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1947, married scientists Carl Ferdinand Cori and Gerty Theresa Cori were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work showing how muscles in the body generate lactate that fuels the liver to produce &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+glucose/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood glucose&lt;/a&gt;, which then cycles back to fuel the muscle.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The work laid the foundation to explain how muscles use a form of lactate (L-lactate), and the liver uses blood glucose to communicate and exchange fuel with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian team found that obese mice—and even people with obesity—have higher levels of a lesser-known molecule, D-lactate, in their blood. Unlike the more familiar L-lactate made by muscles, most of the D-lactate comes from gut microbes and was shown to raise blood sugar and liver fat more aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To stop this, the researchers created a "gut substrate trap"—a safe, biodegradable polymer that binds to D-lactate in the gut and prevents it from being absorbed. Mice fed this trap had lower blood glucose, less insulin resistance, and reduced liver inflammation and fibrosis—all without changing their diet or body weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a completely new way to think about treating metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease. Instead of targeting hormones or the liver directly, we're intercepting a microbial fuel source before it can do harm," says Schertzer, a member of the Center for Metabolism, Obesity, and Diabetes Research (MODR) and Farncombe Family Digestive Health Research Institute at McMaster. Schertzer holds a Canada Research Chair in Metabolic Inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research highlights the growing importance of the microbiome in chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

While no one ever claimed sugar was &lt;em data-node-id="2.5"&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; for you, it turns out that consuming sugar in some forms is actually healthier than others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="3" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;A recent scientific review published in the journal &lt;em data-node-id="3.1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831325000493?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831325000493?via%3Dihub" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Advances in Nutrition" data-node-id="3.1.0" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Advances in Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;had&lt;em data-node-id="3.3"&gt;&lt;/em&gt; researchers analyzing the different ways people consume sugar and found that drinking your sugar is worse than simply eating it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Of course, it's nearly impossible to avoid all sugar, but the study does suggest that people should be choosy about the way they consume sugar in the future. Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="body-tip css-18qyn7q emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="6.0"&gt;Meet the experts:&lt;/strong&gt; Dena Champion, RDN, a dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center; Jessica Cording, RD, CDN, author of The Little Book of Game-Changers; Tara Gidus Collingwood, RDN, a sports nutrition consultant and owner of Tara Gidus Nutrition Consulting; Lisa Moskovitz, RD, CDN, CEO of NY Nutrition Group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-did-the-review-find" data-node-id="7" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="7.0"&gt;What did the review find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;For the review, researchers crunched data from more than half a million people across the world who participated in 29 different studies, looking at their sugar consumption habits and overall health. The researchers found that people who had sugar through beverages (think: soda and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a46595751/fruit-juice-linked-to-weight-gain-study/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a46595751/fruit-juice-linked-to-weight-gain-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="juice" data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;juice&lt;/a&gt;) consistently had a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those who didn't drink as much sugar. But people who ate sugar didn’t have the same link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The results were pretty wild. For every 12-ounce serving someone had of sugar-sweetened beverages a day, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes jumped up by 25 percent. For every 8-ounce serving of fruit juice they had a day, the risk increased by 5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“These findings suggest that dietary sugar consumed as a beverage (sugar sweetened beverages and fruit juice) is associated with incident type 2 diabetes risk,” the researchers wrote in the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="body-text css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;br data-node-id="12.0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-sugar-bad-for-your-overall-health" data-node-id="13" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="13.0"&gt;What is sugar bad for your overall health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The big concern here is &lt;em data-node-id="14.1"&gt;excess &lt;/em&gt;sugar, says &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/dena-champion" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/dena-champion" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dena Champion" data-node-id="14.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Dena Champion&lt;/a&gt;, RDN, a dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. “Excess sugar can lead to increased weight gain and leave less room for healthy options,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Excess sugar also raises the risk of heart disease, dental issues, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, says Tara Gidus Collingwood, RDN, a sports nutrition consultant and owner of &lt;a href="https://dietdiva.net/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-node-id="15.1" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://dietdiva.net/" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tara Gidus Nutrition Consulting" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Tara Gidus Nutrition Consulting&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But it’s okay to have a little sugar, says Lisa Moskovitz, RD, CDN, CEO of &lt;a href="https://www.nynutritiongroup.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nynutritiongroup.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="NY Nutrition Group" data-node-id="16.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;NY Nutrition Group&lt;/a&gt; and author of &lt;em data-node-id="16.3"&gt;The Core 3 Healthy Eating Plan&lt;/em&gt;. “While consuming sugar sporadically and in smaller portions poses no risk for the average healthy person, excessive consumption of added and refined sugar could affect your health over time,” she says. Not only can it cause the issues we already mentioned, but it can also increase the risk of bodily inflammation, which is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11592557/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11592557/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="linked" data-node-id="16.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to a host of serious health conditions, like cancer, autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular issues, she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-is-drinking-sugar-worse-than-eating-it" data-node-id="17" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;Why is drinking sugar worse than eating it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While the researchers established the link between type 2 diabetes risk and drinking sugary beverages, they didn’t dive into that exact cause-effect relationship. But there are some theories. “A lot has to do with the lack of protein, fat, and fiber,” says Jessica Cording, RD, CDN, author of &lt;em data-node-id="18.1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X?tag=womenshealth-auto-20" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Little Book of Game-Changers" data-vars-ga-product-id="11bb313a-a7bd-493a-9c71-0403cdc2f565" rel="nofollow" data-node-id="18.1.0" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X" data-product-url="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X" data-affiliate="true" data-affiliate-url="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X?tag=womenshealth-auto-20" data-affiliate-network='{"afflink_redirect":"/_p/afflink/wtom/amazon-s-little-book-game-changers-managing-dp-163228068x","site_id":"6b499c58-dc46-4f93-80b3-25265395e77a","network":{"name":"Amazon"},"metadata":{"links":{"default":"https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X?tag=womenshealth-auto-20","sem":"https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X?tag=wh-lift-20","social":"https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X?tag=wh-soc-lift-20"}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price="$16.71" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="9a94a843-a907-4f6c-be8a-de1503b6a504" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale | (not set)" class="body-link product-links css-7bauu1 e1aq0z090"&gt;The Little Book of Game-Changers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “If you’re drinking sugar, which is usually in the context of a sugar-sweetened beverage or juice, there’s nothing to slow down the breakdown of it.” Cue the blood sugar spike and crash. It’s also easy to have a lot of sugar in a short period of time when you drink it, she points out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you're drinking soda, you’ll likely take in more sugar at a faster rate than if you were to say, eat some ice cream, says Collingwood. And then there are serving sizes to consider. “Beverages often contain more sugar than a typical serving of a sweet food,” Collingwood says. “A 20-ounce soda can have 15 to 18 teaspoons of sugar.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-worst-sugary-drinks-to-avoid" data-node-id="21" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="21.0"&gt;What are the worst sugary drinks to avoid?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;This study called out sugar-sweetened beverages like soda and juice, points out Champion. “It may be wise to consume both with caution,” she says. Cording agrees. “I don’t recommend having a big sugar-sweetened soda, energy drink, or fruit juice, especially on its own,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Instead of drinking fruit juice, Champion recommends eating the whole fruit (which is also more filling). “Avoid sodas, lemonade, or fruit punch whenever possible,” she says. If you’re craving something fizzy but want to avoid the sugar of soda, Champion suggests experimenting with sparkling water, fruit, and herbs. “Berries and mint go well together,” she points out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Still, while it's probably not great to drink soda or juice regularly, Moskovitz says it's okay to drink it in moderation. So, if you want to treat yourself, go for it.

When the mitochondria in neutrophil cells detect this lactate, they &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2025.02.003" target="_blank" data-url="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2025.02.003" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;start signaling&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the cell to get rid of the NETs that have entrapped bacteria. Once the bacteria are released outside the cell, other immune cells can kill them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we blocked the mitochondria's ability to sense lactate, neutrophils &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2025.02.003" target="_blank" data-url="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2025.02.003" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;failed to produce NETs effectively&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This meant bacteria were more likely to escape capture and proliferate, showing how crucial this mechanism is to immune defense. This process highlights an intricate dialogue between the bacteria's metabolism and the host cell's energy machinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this finding surprising is that the mitochondria within cells are able to detect bacteria trapped in phagosomes, even though the microbes are enclosed in a separate space. Somehow, mitochondrial sensors can pick up cues from within these compartments — an impressive feat of cellular coordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="targeting-mitochondria-to-fight-infections-3"&gt;Targeting mitochondria to fight infections&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study is part of a growing field &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41423-022-00840-x" target="_blank" data-url="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41423-022-00840-x" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;called immunometabolism&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which explores how &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-metabolism-a-biochemist-explains-how-different-people-convert-energy-differently-and-why-that-matters-for-your-health-211816" target="_blank" data-url="https://theconversation.com/what-is-metabolism-a-biochemist-explains-how-different-people-convert-energy-differently-and-why-that-matters-for-your-health-211816" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;metabolism&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and immune function are deeply intertwined. Rather than viewing cellular metabolism as strictly a means to generate energy, researchers are now recognizing it as a central driver of immune decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria sit at the heart of this interaction. Their ability to sense, respond to and even shape the metabolic environment of a cell gives them a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcb.2020.01.006" target="_blank" data-url="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcb.2020.01.006" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;critical role&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in determining how and when immune responses are deployed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, our findings provide a key reason why patients with a chronic autoimmune disease called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK535405/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK535405/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;systemic lupus erythematosus&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; often suffer from recurrent infections. Mitochondria in the neutrophils of lupus patients &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2025.02.003" target="_blank" data-url="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2025.02.003" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fail to sense bacterial lactate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; properly. As a result, NET production was significantly reduced. This mitochondrial dysfunction could explain why lupus patients are more vulnerable to bacterial infections — even though their immune systems are constantly activated due to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This observation points to mitochondria's central role in balancing immune responses. It connects two seemingly unrelated issues: immune overactivity, as seen in lupus, and immune weakness like increased susceptibility to infection. When mitochondria work correctly, they help neutrophils mount an effective, targeted attack on bacteria. But when mitochondria are impaired, this system breaks down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our discovery that mitochondria can sense bacterial lactate to trigger NET formation opens up new possibilities for treating infections. For instance, drugs that enhance mitochondrial sensing could boost NET production in people with weakened immune systems. On the flip side, for conditions where NETs contribute to tissue damage — such as in severe COVID-19 or autoimmune diseases — it might be beneficial to limit this response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, our study raises the question of whether other immune cells use similar mechanisms to sense microbial metabolites, and whether other bacterial byproducts might serve as immune signals. Understanding these pathways in more detail could lead to new treatments that modulate immune responses more precisely, reducing collateral damage while preserving antimicrobial defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria are not just the powerhouses of the cell — they are the immune system's watchtowers, alert to even the faintest metabolic signals of bacterial invaders. As researchers' understanding of their roles expands, so too does our appreciation for the complexity — and adaptability — of our cellular defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This edited article is republished from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://theconversation.com/" target="_blank" data-url="http://theconversation.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

There is a new walking routine going viral these days. 6-6-6 walking routine has been making rounds on social media lately, and for the right reasons. This simple exercise can help you keep yourself fit, primarily because it helps you shed the extra kilos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is no shortage of fitness challenges on social media, the 6-6-6 walking routine has gained traction. Here's everything you need to know about it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Is The 6-6-6 Walking Routine? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/666-walking-trend-weight-loss" rel="noindex,nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Healthline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the 6-6-6 walking routine is a workout that involves "walking for 60 minutes, either at 6 a.m. or 6 p.m. It additionally includes a 6-minute warm-up at a slow pace to help you ease into walking and a 6-minute cool-down to aid in recovery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a workout, the 6-6-6 routine is more like a lifestyle shift that activates your metabolism, promotes heart health, and aids in weight management - all while being gentle to your joints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-personalisation---lifestyle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

found a direct link between exposure to wildfire smoke and a sharp rise in dementia diagnoses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings raise new concerns about the long-term neurological impacts of worsening air quality fueled by increasingly severe wildfires. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently, about 42 percent of Americans over 55 are expected to develop dementia, with annual cases &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14279053/Americans-dementia-disease-underestimated.html"&gt;projected to nearly double from 514,000 in 2020 to one million by 2060&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers pinpointed wildfire smoke as especially harmful because it contains tiny toxic particles known as PM2.5, microscopic pollutants roughly 30 times thinner than a human hair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike typical city smog or car exhaust, t&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14765103/air-quality-canada-wildfires-michigan-minnesota-wisconsin.html"&gt;hese particles can enter the bloodstream &lt;/a&gt;and travel to the brain, causing inflammation that increases the risk of memory loss and cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PM2.5 particles can also weaken the blood-brain barrier, the brain's protective shield, making it vulnerable to damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14907953/air-quality-emergency-new-york-michigan-minnesota-illinois-vermont.html"&gt;Amid one of the most intense wildfire seasons on record&lt;/a&gt;, over 4,000 fires scorching nearly 200,000 acres in California as of mid-July 2025, this threat is growing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A new study reveals that wildfire smoke, is directly linked to a sharp rise in dementia diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wildfire smoke is an unpredictable and highly toxic mix of burned vegetation, plastics, metals, and chemicals from destroyed homes and vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It forms at higher temperatures and lingers longer in the air, making it far more damaging per microgram than pollution from factories or traffic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study found that a mere one-microgram increase in wildfire-related PM2.5 per cubic meter of air raises the risk of a dementia diagnosis by 21 percent over three years, nearly 20 times the risk posed by the same amount of PM2.5 from other pollution sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Holly Elser, neurologist and lead author from the University of Pennsylvania, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6048497/California-wildfire-smoke-set-cause-lung-issues-nationwide.html"&gt;said, 'Air pollution from wildfires now makes up more than 70 percent of total PM2.5 on poor air quality days in California.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These findings highlight the urgent need for stronger wildfire prevention policies and better smoke mitigation strategies.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To measure long-term exposure, researchers combined satellite data with ground air quality monitors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the Journal of the Alzheimer's Association, focused on cognitively healthy individuals over 60 and controlled for income, smoking, health conditions, and race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As wildfires worsen, experts warn that addressing this silent threat is critical to protecting brain health for millions of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" data-gramm="false"&gt;By mid-July 2025, over 4,000 fires had already burned nearly 200,000 acres in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also found the worst health effects in low-income and minority communities, groups more likely to live in high-smoke areas and less likely to have access to indoor air filtration or protective equipment like N95 masks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Joan Casey, a senior author of the study and assistant professor in the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences at the University of Washington, Seattle: 'These findings underscore that clinical and health policies seeking to prevent dementia-associated disparities should include efforts to reduce exposure to long-term wildfire and non-wildfire PM2.5.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For decades, pollution has been linked to heart and lung disease, but this study adds to growing evidence that it also harms the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Claire Sexton of the Alzheimer's Association, said: 'We've thought about pollution as a lung and heart issue for decades, but now we are seeing its effects on memory, cognition, and aging, and it's deeply troubling.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As wildfire seasons stretch longer, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-11426259/Americas-growing-wildfire-crisis-lead-wave-health-issues-years-come-heres-why.html"&gt;sometimes from May through December, and heatwaves worsen&lt;/a&gt; across the western US, scientists warned that the neurological impact of poor air quality could be the next major public health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended staying indoors on days when the Air Quality Index (AQI) hits 100 or higher, using high-efficiency furnace filters (rated MERV 13 or above), and wearing certified N95 masks if outdoor exposure is unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These warnings come as the overall risk of dementia continues to rise nationwide.

							&lt;p&gt;The cat who changed everything arrived during the second year of lockdown, when touch had become dangerous and algorithms determined who we could love. Tom found her—a tortoiseshell with one white paw—behind a dumpster in Queens, brought her home to the apartment he shared with Sarah, and named her Mochi. Within a week, she'd chosen Sarah completely, definitively, with the kind of certainty that dating apps promise but never deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Tom kneels on their kitchen floor at 6 AM, holding salmon treats in one hand and speaking in the high-pitched voice we reserve for creatures we desperately want to love us back. Mochi sits perfectly still, green eyes locked not on him but on the doorway where Sarah will eventually appear. When she does—hair messy, still in pajamas—the cat transforms. Stone becomes water. Mochi flows between Sarah's legs, purring like something mechanical and necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"She hates me," Tom says, not for the first time, dropping the rejected treats back in the bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah scoops up Mochi, who immediately nestles into her collarbone. "She doesn't hate you."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we all know what Tom knows: in a world where we swipe through faces hoping for mutual selection, where algorithms sort us into desirable and undesirable, where even our cats seem to have standards we can't meet, rejection hits different now. Mochi has made her choice with the kind of absoluteness that no amount of data science can replicate. And it wasn't him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The algorithm of the heart&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started collecting these stories after Tom first told me about Mochi, and they're everywhere once you start looking. The golden retriever at my local dog park who walks past his owner to follow a stranger who resembles his first human. My neighbor's African grey parrot who learned thirty words from their daughter but remains silent when anyone else approaches. The therapy dog who, despite training that should make him love everyone equally, spends every free moment beside one particular resident at the nursing home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want simple explanations: whoever feeds the pet becomes the favorite, or animals prefer whoever spends the most time with them. But the evidence tells a different story. Tom feeds Mochi every morning. He plays with her, cleans her litter box, paid the vet bills for that eye infection last spring. By any algorithmic measure—time invested, resources provided, care demonstrated—he should be her chosen person. Yet Mochi waits by the door each evening for Sarah, who works sixty-hour weeks and sometimes doesn't get home until after the cat's bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes this particularly resonant now is how it mirrors our broader cultural moment. Young adults navigating dating apps report that rejection sensitivity—the tendency to anxiously expect, readily perceive, and intensely react to rejection—has become a defining feature of modern romance. We've gamified love, turned it into a series of binary decisions, yes or no, swipe left or swipe right. But animals don't swipe. They just know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom tells me he's started thinking of Mochi's preference as "analog rejection"—no ghosting, no mixed signals, no "it's not you, it's me." Just clear, consistent choice. "In a weird way, it's almost refreshing," he says. "At least I know where I stand."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The biology of being chosen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what actually happens when Mochi sees Sarah: both of their brains release oxytocin, the same hormone that bonds mothers to infants. When researchers at Azabu University in Japan studied &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1261022"&gt;dog-human interactions&lt;/a&gt;, they discovered this interspecies oxytocin loop—mutual gazing increased the hormone in both parties by up to 300%, creating what scientists call a "positive feedback loop" of attachment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But oxytocin isn't just about creating bonds; it's about creating &lt;em&gt;selective&lt;/em&gt; bonds. &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1322868111"&gt;Research from Duke University's Canine Cognition Center&lt;/a&gt; found that when dogs were given oxytocin, they didn't become indiscriminately affectionate. Instead, the hormone made them more discerning, increasing their preference for people who matched their energy and emotional state. Female dogs, in particular, showed heightened selectivity—choosing to gaze longer at their owners while becoming more wary of strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This selectivity operates below conscious awareness. A &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93922-1"&gt;2021 study comparing pet dogs with pack-living dogs and wolves&lt;/a&gt;revealed that only household pets showed oxytocin spikes during human interaction. Despite being hand-raised by humans, pack animals maintained their own social hierarchies. The difference? Pet dogs live embedded in our daily rhythms, sharing our schedules, our spaces, our emotional weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom's anxiety about being rejected—his tentative approaches, his slight tension when he reaches for Mochi—may actually be pushing her toward Sarah's calmer presence. Studies of attachment in shelter animals show that &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5451941/"&gt;cats and dogs are remarkably attuned to human stress signals&lt;/a&gt;, often preferring people whose cortisol levels are lower. The science suggests our pets aren't just choosing who they like best; they're choosing who makes them feel most regulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I used to think I was doing everything right," Tom says. "But maybe trying so hard was exactly what I was doing wrong."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The certainty crisis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah works in user experience design, building the invisible architectures that guide our choices online. When I ask her about Mochi's preference, she laughs. "At work, we spend millions trying to predict and influence user behavior. We A/B test button colors, optimize conversion funnels, build machine learning models to anticipate what people want before they know they want it. Then I come home to this cat who decided within three days that I was her person, based on... what? My smell? The way I didn't try too hard? Some ineffable cat algorithm we'll never decode?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She's touching on something profound about our current moment. Dating app algorithms now sort potential matches based on everything from facial symmetry to linguistic patterns in our profiles—while claiming to connect people based on deeper compatibility. The very platforms designed to reduce the uncertainty of romantic connection have instead amplified it. Every match might be the algorithm manipulating you. Every rejection might be the code deciding you're not optimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mochi's choice feels different precisely because it's illegible to our optimization-obsessed age. There's no API for a cat's affection, no way to hack your way into being chosen. This illegibility feels like resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During lockdown, when everyone's cortisol levels were spiking, this regulatory function became even more crucial. Pets weren't just companions; they were co-regulation partners. And like all intimate relationships, the match had to be right. Chemistry, even between species, can't be forced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The privilege of rejection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend who works at a Brooklyn shelter tells me the saddest stories involve returns. "Someone adopts a dog, expecting instant love, and when the dog bonds with their roommate or their kid instead, they bring it back. As if the animal failed some test." She pauses. "The weird thing is, these are often the same people who complain about dating apps being superficial. They want authentic connection but can't handle when authentic connection doesn't choose them."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's a darker edge to these dynamics that becomes visible when you look across economic lines. Research on pet ownership during economic hardship reveals that financially stressed pet owners are more likely to risk their own health and safety for their animals, especially when the bond is strong. The same connection that provides comfort can become a vulnerability when resources are scarce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom and Sarah can afford to find Mochi's rejection amusing, even endearing. They have the economic cushion to treat it as a quirky household dynamic rather than a source of genuine distress. But for someone who's lost everything else—job, home, human relationships—being rejected by the creature you've saved can hit different. The very intensity of human-animal bonds means they carry real stakes, and those stakes aren't equally distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I volunteer at the shelter sometimes," Tom tells me. "You see people who have nothing, whose dog is everything to them. If that dog preferred someone else? I don't think they could laugh it off like I do."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learning from the unchosen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six months after our first conversation, something has shifted in Tom and Sarah's apartment. Tom no longer approaches Mochi with treats and desperate hope. He simply exists in the space, reading on the couch while she sits on Sarah's lap. And sometimes—not often, but sometimes—Mochi walks across the couch to sniff his book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I stopped trying to make her love me," Tom says. "I figured if I rescued her, gave her a good home, that should be enough. Even if she picked Sarah as her person."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The irony is that this acceptance has actually improved their relationship. Without the pressure of Tom's expectations, Mochi has begun to show small signs of acknowledgment—a slow blink here, a brief head bump there. Research on feline behavior suggests that cats are more likely to approach humans who ignore them, a phenomenon that &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6826447/"&gt;Japanese researchers call the "cat paradox"&lt;/a&gt;. She'll never be his cat the way she's Sarah's cat, but she's beginning to recognize him as part of her chosen person's pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shift in Tom's approach mirrors something larger about how we might navigate connection in an algorithmic age. "I've stopped taking it personally," he tells me. "Like, genuinely stopped. And weirdly, that's made me think differently about online dating too. Some matches won't text back, some cats won't choose you, and that's just... how choice works."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beyond the algorithm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stories I've collected reveal patterns that resist datafication. The elderly woman whose cat hides from everyone except the grocery delivery person who reminds him of his first owner. The couple whose dog chose their neighbor, leading to a joint custody arrangement that became a friendship none of them expected. The child whose hamster will only eat when she's in the room, a preference so specific it reorganized the family's entire dinner routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These choices create what Sarah calls "desire paths"—the routes worn by actual use rather than planned design. In UX, desire paths show where users actually want to go, regardless of where designers thought they should go. Mochi's preference carved a desire path through their household, reorganizing the emotional landscape in ways no amount of planning could have predicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent neuroscience research suggests these preferences might be encoded at levels we're only beginning to understand. A &lt;a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-022-04199-1"&gt;2023 study on interspecies attachment&lt;/a&gt; found that animals form mental maps of their social world as complex as our own, with preferred individuals occupying privileged positions in their cognitive geography. When Mochi chose Sarah, she wasn't just selecting a food provider—she was mapping her emotional universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The gift of arbitrary love&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is what we're actually seeking when we talk about authentic connection: not the guarantee of being chosen, but the reality of choice itself. In a world where algorithms increasingly mediate our relationships, where machine learning tries to predict compatibility based on data points, the arbitrary certainty of an animal's preference feels like resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom and Sarah's apartment has become a living experiment in acceptance. Mochi still waits by the door for Sarah. She still purrs louder when Sarah holds her. But she also now acknowledges Tom as part of her territory, someone worthy of the occasional head bump, the rare slow blink that cat behaviorists call a "kitty kiss."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You know what's changed most?" Tom reflects. "I'm not performing for her anymore. I'm just... here. And apparently, that's enough for her to occasionally remember I exist."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This opacity might be the real gift our pets offer us. In an age of radical transparency, where our preferences are tracked, stored, analyzed, and sold, the mystery of animal choice remains uncolonized by data. We can't A/B test our way to a cat's affection or optimize our way into a dog's heart. We can only be present, patient, and open to the possibility that love—real love—doesn't always choose us back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pets in our homes are running ancient software on hardware refined by millions of years of evolution. When Mochi chose Sarah, she wasn't making a decision based on optimization or compatibility scores. She was responding to something older than algorithms, deeper than data, more mysterious than any machine learning model we've yet built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that's why these stories of animal favoritism captivate us now more than ever. They remind us that in a world of manufactured connections and predicted preferences, some choices remain wild. Arbitrary. Absolute. Even if we're not the ones chosen, we get to witness choice itself—pure, inexplicable, and certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time you see a pet clearly playing favorites, resist the urge to take it personally. Instead, marvel at what you're witnessing: millions of years of evolution culminating in this precise moment, when one small mammal looks at one specific human and says, in all the ways they can: "You. It's you."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if it's not you, there's something profound in being present for that choosing—in seeing love declare itself, mysterious and sure, in a world that's forgotten what certainty feels like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Mediterranean diet helps support healthy aging and longevity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top foods dietitians recommend include leafy greens, low-fat dairy, beans, nuts and fish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Women over 50 should eat plenty of calcium, vitamin D, protein, fiber and omega-3 fats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For women over 50 looking to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8055902/healthy-habits-to-help-you-live-longer/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support long-term health and longevity&lt;/a&gt;, the Mediterranean diet offers a delicious, sustainable way of eating based on whole, nutrient-dense foods. “I can say from both personal and professional experience that what we eat in our 50s—and beyond—matters more than ever. These are the years when we start to feel the effects of hormonal shifts, bone loss and changes in muscle mass and metabolism,” says &lt;a href="https://www.lizshealthytable.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Liz Weiss, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. She emphasizes the importance of not just living longer, but living better, which includes feeling strong, sharp and energized throughout the years. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fortunately, the Mediterranean diet has been linked to a longer, healthier life.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It centers around minimally-processed plants, healthy fats and plenty of fiber.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-leafy-greens"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Leafy Greens &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Leafy greens—such as spinach, kale, arugula, lettuce and chard—are powerful foods for brain and heart health. “The MIND Diet, which combines the Mediterranean and DASH eating patterns, ranks leafy greens as one of its top food groups for cognitive protection,” says Weiss. She points to a 2018 study showing that older adults who ate 1–2 servings of leafy greens daily experienced slower cognitive decline—equivalent to being 11 years younger than those who rarely ate them.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The authors credit the brain-supporting benefits of leafy greens to their rich nutritional profile, including a wide range of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://realnutritionnyc.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Amy Shapiro, MS, RD&lt;/a&gt;, adds, “rich in calcium, vitamin K, magnesium and antioxidants, leafy greens are important for maintaining bone strength and reducing inflammation.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fortunately, leafy greens are easy to add to your diet. Weiss recommends &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7899673/kale-spinach-smoothie/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blending baby spinach into smoothies&lt;/a&gt;, adding arugula to sandwiches and grain bowls and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8037286/super-green-pasta/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;making pesto with kale&lt;/a&gt; for a flavorful topping on fish or pasta. Shapiro suggests sautéing greens with garlic and lemon for a quick side dish, or using them as the base for any salad or adding to soups, omelets and grain bowls.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-beans"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Beans  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans are a cornerstone of the Mediterranean diet and offer many health benefits—such as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7939797/the-top-mediterranean-foods-for-better-blood-sugars/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;better blood sugar regulation&lt;/a&gt;, a healthier gut and heart and increased longevity—thanks to their rich fiber and nutrient content.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In societies like the Blue Zones—five regions around the world, including parts of the Mediterranean, where people often live past 100—beans are a daily staple, adds Weiss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “These humble pulses are packed with plant-based protein, iron, potassium and fiber, which helps to reduce LDL cholesterol and supports digestive regularity,” she says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans are also an excellent way to boost fiber intake—something most people fall short on. Their fiber supports a healthy gut and keeps blood sugar steady. Because they’re digested slowly, beans produce a lower glycemic response and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-reduce-insulin-resistance-for-better-blood-sugar-8750433" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;improve insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;. The fiber and protein in beans make them especially filling, which can support weight maintenance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Shapiro emphasizes the importance of getting enough of both, as digestion and muscle health become more important with age.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To add more beans to your diet, try canned varieties—they’re versatile, budget-friendly and convenient. Weiss recommends draining and rinsing canned beans to reduce sodium by up to 40%, making them a quick and heart-smart option. “Add chickpeas to grain bowls or salads, stir black beans into soups or tacos or puree white beans into dips and sauces for extra creaminess and nutrition,” she says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-cottage-cheese-or-low-fat-strained-greek-style-yogurt"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Cottage Cheese or Low-Fat Strained (Greek-Style) Yogurt &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Nearly half of women over 50 have some form of low bone mass,” says Weiss. After menopause, declining estrogen levels can accelerate bone loss, increasing the risk of osteoporosis—a condition where bones become weaker and more prone to fractures.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To support bone health, both Weiss and Shapiro recommend foods that offer a combination of calcium and protein, which are key components of strong, healthy bones. Two excellent low-fat options within the Mediterranean diet are strained (Greek-style) yogurt and cottage cheese. For example, one cup of Greek yogurt offers about 20 grams of protein and 220 mg of calcium, while one cup of cottage cheese provides 24 grams of protein and 227 mg of calcium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Shapiro enjoys &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-protein-upgrade-for-your-morning-toast-11681776" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cottage cheese on toast&lt;/a&gt; with sliced tomatoes and fresh pepper, with berries and nuts or as a substitute for sour cream or mayo in recipes. Weiss suggests using strained (Greek-style) yogurt or cottage cheese in smoothies, as a base for savory dips or in breakfast parfaits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-nuts"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Nuts  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another Mediterranean staple, nuts are valued for their rich flavor and impressive nutrient profile, making them a delicious and healthy addition to your diet. “Nuts offer healthy fats, fiber and plant-based protein,” says Weiss. “They also provide vitamin E (a potent antioxidant linked to cognitive health), magnesium (important for bone health), and, in the case of walnuts, plant-based omega-3 fats,” says Weiss. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beyond their nutrient content, nuts can also support weight management—a common challenge with age. In fact, one study found that higher nut consumption was associated with lower body fat, likely due to increased satiety.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, given their high-calorie content, it’s important not to overdo it. Weiss recommends consuming a small handful (around one ounce) of nuts daily. “Sprinkle them onto leafy green salads, stir into cooked oatmeal, or finely chop and mix with breadcrumbs to create a crisp, flavorful coating for baked chicken or fish. Toasting them first really enhances flavor,” she says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-fatty-fish"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Fatty Fish &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fatty fish, a major star of the Mediterranean diet, can reduce your risk of cognitive decline and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7920294/foods-to-eat-every-day-for-brain-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support brain health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fatty fish are a top source of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-as-many-omega-3s-as-salmon-11681920" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, especially EPA and DHA. These fats are “linked to better brain function, reduced inflammation and lower risk of cardiovascular disease,” says Weiss. However, “women do not get enough omega-3s,” Shapiro adds, emphasizing the need to make these fats a regular part of the diet. That’s why Weiss recommends that women include SMASH fish—salmon, mackerel, anchovies, sardines and herring—at least twice a week to help meet their omega-3 needs. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “They also provide vitamin D, which is crucial for calcium absorption,” Shapiro adds. Together, these nutrients support strong, healthy bones and can be challenging to get through diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To add more fatty fish to your diet, visit a local seafood market for the catch of the day or try convenient, budget-friendly canned varieties that are just as nutritious.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Mediterranean diet is a great way for women over 50 to promote long-term health. It includes foods like leafy greens, beans, low-fat dairy, nuts and fish, which provide key nutrients for this stage of life—such as calcium, vitamin D, fiber, protein and omega-3 fatty acids. They’re also accessible and convenient choices. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Shapiro reminds us that, “Consistency in your food choices matters more than perfection. Eating well isn’t about restriction, it’s about making smart, nourishing choices most of the time that fit into your life and support how you want to feel and function every day.” She adds, “Don’t underestimate the power of hydration, regular movement and sleep. These work hand in hand with nutrition to support healthy aging.”&lt;br&gt;

People in coastal areas tend to live longer than the national average, while those in urban areas near inland rivers or lakes may live slightly shorter lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why is the ocean different from inland water?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Coastal areas offer milder temperatures, better air quality, more recreation, and higher income—all of which support longevity. In contrast, inland urban waterways are often linked to pollution, poverty, and flood risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are rural areas near water any different?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Rural residents near water appear to gain some health and lifespan benefits, though not as consistently as coastal dwellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study shows that living near the ocean may be linked to a longer life—while living near inland rivers or lakes in urban areas may actually shorten it. Researchers analyzed data from over 66,000 U.S. census tracts and found coastal residents live, on average, at least a year longer than the national average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benefits may be tied to cleaner air, better weather, and increased physical activity near coastlines, while inland water areas—especially in cities—were associated with pollution, poverty, and increased health risks. The findings suggest not all “blue spaces” are equal when it comes to your lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longevity Boost:&lt;/strong&gt; Coastal residents may live one year longer than the U.S. average.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urban Inland Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; City dwellers near rivers or lakes may have &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; life expectancy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environmental Divide:&lt;/strong&gt; Air quality, temperature, and socioeconomic conditions likely explain the difference.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Living within miles of the ocean breeze may be linked to a longer life, but you shouldn’t count on the same benefits if you live in a riverside city, suggests a recent study.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from The Ohio State University analyzed population data — including life expectancy — in more than 66,000 census tracts throughout the U.S. and compared it based on proximity to waterways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their study was published online in the journal &lt;em&gt;Environmental Research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A correlation between longer life expectancy and water was clear for those who live within about 30 miles of an ocean or gulf. But for those who live in urban settings and near an inland body of water larger than 4 square miles, the opposite was true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rural residents who live near water may also reap some lifespan advantages, according to the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overall, the coastal residents were expected to live a year or more longer than the 79-year average, and those who lived in more urban areas near inland rivers and lakes were likely to die by about 78 or so. The coastal residents probably live longer due to a variety of intertwined factors,” said lead researcher Jianyong “Jamie” Wu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis suggested that milder temperatures, better air quality, more opportunities for recreation, better transportation, less susceptibility to drought, and higher incomes could all be contributors to a better outlook for coastal residents compared to those who live inland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On the other side, pollution, poverty, lack of safe opportunities to be physically active and an increased risk of flooding are likely drivers of these differences,” said Yanni Cao, a postdoctoral researcher who worked on the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most critical difference the researchers found is that coastal areas experience fewer hot days and lower maximum temperatures compared to inland water areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has found a connection between living near water and better health measures, including higher physical activity levels, lower obesity rates and improved heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That prompted Wu to wonder if there could be a link between “blue space” living and longer lives, and how that relationship might differ depending on the type of neighborhood people call home, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We thought it was possible that any type of ‘blue space’ would offer some beneficial effects, and we were surprised to find such a significant and clear difference between those who live near coastal waters and those who live near inland waters,” said Wu, an assistant professor of environmental health sciences at The Ohio State University College of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found a clear difference — in coastal areas, people are living longer,” said Wu, adding that the study is the first to comprehensively and systematically examine the relationship between various types of “blue space” and longevity in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cao said she was especially curious about how this data might provide insights into the trends in life expectancy in the U.S. compared to other wealthy nations. In the past several years, the U.S. experienced a sharper decline and a slower rebound in life expectancy than peer countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s likely that various social determinants of health, including complex environmental factors, that contribute to health inequities are playing a key role in the differences we saw,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ria Martins, a graduate student in public health, was also a co-author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this longevity and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e78495868982c9d6d6a7889492c9828392" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Misti Crane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://osu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Misti Crane – Ohio State University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2025.121981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Unveiling complexity in blue spaces and life expectancy&lt;/a&gt;” by Jianyong “Jamie” Wu et al. &lt;em&gt;Environmental Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unveiling complexity in blue spaces and life expectancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although growing evidence supports the positive impact of blue spaces on human health, research on their association with life expectancy remains limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study examines the association between coastal and inland waters and life expectancy across 66,263 census tracts in the United States, incorporating socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic factors through multiple linear and multi-level regression as well as spatial regression models, supplemented by sensitivity analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that proximity to coastal waters is positively associated with life expectancy, whereas proximity to inland waters is negatively associated. We used the mutual information model to identify key factors contributing to these differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a comparative analysis of coastal and inland water environments, we found that longer life expectancy near coastal waters may be linked to more favorable environmental and socioeconomic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include milder temperatures, better air quality, enhanced recreational opportunities, improved transportation, lower drought susceptibility, and higher income levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The urban–rural analysis further reveals that proximity to coastal waters is positively associated with life expectancy in both settings, whereas inland waters show differing associations, being negative in urban areas and positive in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to examining these blue space patterns, this study also considers broader socioeconomic and environmental factors related to life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight the importance of integrating blue spaces and other key environmental and socioeconomic factors into urban planning, residential development, and healthcare environment design to improve life expectancy and health equity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 12:36:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE1Kci1QWFNXUmlYSWxYOHNjT3pscmxtc0FuMzk5QzV6UmVkcEJwalAtbjU3UlExZXRoWDRIWmEwVDlvOUVBX3FrNmM2bFlUMkFxRHYwTDM2N1plY0YyejB4ZUtnXzFwVmNYMkVsME1uaVoydw</guid></item><item><title>体内糖尿病的7个早期征兆-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0gFBVV95cUxQN01fN0JFTWh1S2ZaMVZUbUFQOFhRVGUxb1Rma041S0Q1Zy1jbGp2RGVISlp5RkVRVjBieWtnRm9BRmRfOExzU1dqR0UtM1dBOXJZMG05LXBYX1FZbW80Q2xCS1k4Y0pnU094S1JPWk1hVDBuUDlZTFZZQmZROFdaX0JSel9SdEJzUG9XT1Q5ZjZyWVJLbVJYbnRRVGx3Z1JJTEpCMDZLb0x5eHNreDJDclF6TE81T2ZfZWZtZHpWRmxmX280WXZXR29lLU54QTAtcVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the more serious and early signs of diabetes is nerve damage, also called diabetic neuropathy. This generally starts as a sensation of tingling, burning, or numbness which is felt in the fingers, toes, hands, or feet. This is caused by high blood sugar levels that silently damage the nerve endings. If left undetected or untreated, it can even lead to permanent nerve damage in the long run. So, pay attention to the subtle signs your body gives that can indicate to serious underlying health issues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 11:54:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0gFBVV95cUxQN01fN0JFTWh1S2ZaMVZUbUFQOFhRVGUxb1Rma041S0Q1Zy1jbGp2RGVISlp5RkVRVjBieWtnRm9BRmRfOExzU1dqR0UtM1dBOXJZMG05LXBYX1FZbW80Q2xCS1k4Y0pnU094S1JPWk1hVDBuUDlZTFZZQmZROFdaX0JSel9SdEJzUG9XT1Q5ZjZyWVJLbVJYbnRRVGx3Z1JJTEpCMDZLb0x5eHNreDJDclF6TE81T2ZfZWZtZHpWRmxmX280WXZXR29lLU54QTAtcVE</guid></item></channel></rss>
