Further investigation revealed that the colony was nesting in an attic space above those eight guest rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The rooms were closed as a precaution while public health officials investigate and provide recommendations for mitigation, according to the National Park Service.

Bats help with natural pest control by eating insects — such as mosquitoes — every night, according to the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The most common species of bats found in Grand Teton National Park are little brown bats, followed by big brown, silver-haired, hoary, Yuma, long-legged, and long-eared bats, the agency said. Other bats, including California myotis and western small-footed bats, have also been found at the park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The National Park Service noted that less than one percent of bats have rabies and has advised park visitors to follow guidelines to &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/rabid-bats-sparked-public-health-095106987.html" data-ylk="slk:avoid exposure to rabies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;avoid exposure to rabies&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Observe wildlife from a safe distance.

In Wyoming, the National Park Service said rabies are most commonly found in bats and skunks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Though rabies is fatal, the CDC says that it is a preventable disease, and has advised people to receive a pre-exposure vaccination for increased protection, vaccinate pets, and immediately seek medical care if exposed. The disease mostly impacts the central nervous system, and causes severe brain disease and death if medical care is not received before the onset of symptoms, according to the National Park Service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It can take weeks to months for rabies symptoms to appear after the initial exposure, the agency said.

			&lt;p&gt;A patient with type 1  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="171085" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; has begun producing his own insulin after receiving a transplant of pancreatic cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time in humans, these islet cells have been genetically edited so they wouldn't be rejected by the patient, removing the need for immunosuppressant drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type 1 diabetes usually begins when the immune system mistakenly attacks the islet cells in the pancreas, which are responsible for producing insulin. The condition is usually managed with a careful diet and regular insulin injections, but an &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-grown-functional-insulin-producing-cells-from-stem-cells"&gt;emerging treatment&lt;/a&gt; involves replacing the damaged islet cells with functional ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-treatment-may-cure-severe-type-1-diabetes-study-finds"&gt;New Treatment May Cure Severe Type 1 Diabetes, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new proof-of-concept study, a 42-year-old male patient, who had had type 1 diabetes since the age of 5, received a transplant of islet cells from a healthy donor. The cells were delivered through a series of injections into the muscle of his forearm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next 12 weeks, the cells successfully produced insulin in response to glucose spikes, such as after meals. But the most important aspect is that the patient didn't require immunosuppressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, the immune system will recognize the transplanted cells as foreign and destroy them, rendering the therapy ineffective. &lt;a href="https://www.diabetes.org.uk/guide-to-diabetes/managing-your-diabetes/treating-your-diabetes/islet-cell-transplants"&gt;To get around that&lt;/a&gt;, patients are given drugs that suppress their immune system. That solution works, but leaves the patients vulnerable to infections and other illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, before the cells were implanted, three genetic edits were made using the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/crispr-gene-editing" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73025" data-postid="171085" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;CRISPR&lt;/a&gt; tool. Two edits reduced the amount of particular antigens that adaptive T cells use to identify foreign objects. The third boosted production of a protein called CD47, which in turn blocks innate immune cell responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all of the gene edits were successful, but in a way that provided an intriguing control group. Cells with no successful edits were killed off by T cells within a few weeks, while those that knocked out the antigen production were still wiped out by natural killer cells and macrophages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only those with three successful edits survived, and thankfully there were enough of them in the graft to remain functional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171389" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171389" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Human_pancreatic_islet-1-642x482.jpg" alt="Islet Cells" class="size-medium wp-image-171389" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Human_pancreatic_islet-1-642x482.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Human_pancreatic_islet-1-553x415.jpg 553w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Human_pancreatic_islet-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Human_pancreatic_islet-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Human_pancreatic_islet-1-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Human_pancreatic_islet-1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171389" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Pancreatic islet cells stained for glucagon  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="171085" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibody&lt;/a&gt; (red) and insulin antibody (blue) under the microscope.

Similar studies in humans have shown promise, but always with the help of immunosuppressant drugs, which bring their own complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, doctors &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/world-first-stem-cells-reverse-type-1-diabetes-in-clinical-trial"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that a young woman in China received a transplant of insulin-producing cells grown from her own  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="171085" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt;. Within four months, her body was able to produce enough insulin to stay within a safe blood glucose range for over 98 percent of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers on the new study say that their method could not only make for more effective, safer treatments for diabetes, but could be applied to other types of cells, reducing the need for immunosuppressants with other transplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2503822"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Scientists found that microglia, immune cells in the brain, mistakenly remove nerve fibers connecting the locus coeruleus and olfactory bulb—two regions essential for processing odors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This immune-driven pruning occurs when hyperactive neurons display altered membranes, marking them as defective even when they are not. By identifying this mechanism, the study highlights a pathway that could allow for earlier diagnosis and treatment before cognitive symptoms begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune Misfire:&lt;/strong&gt; Microglia break down nerve fibers linking the locus coeruleus and olfactory bulb.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Signal:&lt;/strong&gt; These changes occur before cognitive decline, making smell loss a potential diagnostic tool.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Window:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may allow earlier use of amyloid-beta antibody treatments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;DZNE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A fading sense of smell can be one of the earliest signs of Alzheimer’s disease even before cognitive impairments manifest. Research by scientists at DZNE and Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU) sheds new light on this phenomenon, pointing to a significant role for the brain’s immune response, which seems to fatally attack neuronal fibers crucial for the perception of odors. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, is based on observations in mice and humans, including analysis of brain tissue and so-called PET scanning. These findings may help to devise ways for early diagnosis and, consequently, early treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers come to the conclusion that these olfactory dysfunctions arise because immune cells of the brain called “microglia” remove connections between two brain regions, namely the olfactory bulb and the locus coeruleus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The olfactory bulb, located in the forebrain, analyzes sensory information from the nose’s scent receptors. The locus coeruleus, a region of the brainstem, influences this processing by means of long nerve fibers originating from neurons in the locus coeruleus and extending all the way to the olfactory bulb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “The locus coeruleus regulates a variety physiological mechanisms. These include, for example, cerebral blood flow, sleep-wake cycles, and sensory processing. The latter applies, in particular, also to the sense of smell,” says Dr. Lars Paeger, a scientist at DZNE and LMU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study suggests that in early Alzheimer’s disease, changes occur in the nerve fibers linking the locus coeruleus to the olfactory bulb. These alterations signal to the microglia that affected fibers are defective or superfluous. Consequently, the microglia break them down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alterations in the membrane&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the team of Dr. Lars Paeger and Prof. Dr. Jochen Herms, who is a co-author of the current publication, found evidence of changes in the composition of the membranes of the affected nerve fibers: Phosphatidylserine, a fatty acid that usually occurs inside a neuron’s membrane, had been moved to the outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Presence of phosphatidylserine at the outer site of the cell membrane is known to be an “eat-me” signal for microglia. In the olfactory bulb, this is usually associated with a process called synaptic pruning, which serves to remove unnecessary or dysfunctional neuronal connections”, explains Paeger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our situation, we assume that the shift in membrane composition is triggered by hyperactivity of the affected neurons due to Alzheimer’s disease. That is, these neurons exhibit abnormal firing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A wide range of data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of Paeger and colleagues are based on a plethora of observations. These include studies on mice with features of Alzheimer’s disease, analysis of brain samples from deceased Alzheimer’s patients, and positron emission tomography (PET) scans of the brains of individuals with Alzheimer’s or mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Smell issues in Alzheimer’s disease and damage to the associated nerves have been discussed for some time. However, the causes were unclear until yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now, our ﬁndings point to an immunological mechanism as cause for such dysfunctions – and, in particular, that such events already arise in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease,” says Joachim Herms, a research group leader at DZNE and LMU as well as a member of the Munich-based “SyNergy” Cluster of Excellence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perspectives for early diagnosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So-called amyloid-beta antibodies have recently become available for the treatment of Alzheimer’s. For this novel therapy to be effective, it needs to be applied at an early stage of the disease, and this is precisely where the current research could be significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings could pave the way for the early identification of patients at risk of developing Alzheimer’s, enabling them to undergo comprehensive testing to confirm the diagnosis before cognitive problems arise. This would allow earlier intervention with amyloid-beta antibodies, increasing the probability of a positive response,” says Herms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this olfaction and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e08d8192839593ce8e8589949a859294a0849a8e85ce8485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Marcus Neitzert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dzne.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DZNE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Marcus Neitzert – DZNE&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-62500-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Early Locus Coeruleus noradrenergic axon loss drives olfactory dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;” by Lars Paeger et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Locus Coeruleus noradrenergic axon loss drives olfactory dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) often begins with non-cognitive symptoms such as olfactory deficits, which can predict later cognitive decline, though the mechanisms remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pathologically, the brainstem locus coeruleus (LC), the main source of the neurotransmitter noradrenalin (NA) modulating olfactory information processing is affected early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show early and distinct loss of noradrenergic input to the olfactory bulb (OB) coinciding with impaired olfaction in an AD mouse model, before appearance of amyloid plaques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mechanistically, OB microglia recognize and phagocytose LC axons. Reducing phagocytosis genetically preserves LC axons and olfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prodromal AD patients display elevated TSPO-PET signals in the OB, similarly to &lt;em&gt;App&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;NL-G-F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice. We further confirm early LC axon degeneration in post-mortem OBs in patients with early AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings reveal a mechanism linking early LC damage to hyposmia in AD, suggesting olfactory testing and neurocircuit imaging for early diagnosis and enable timely therapeutic intervention for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 20:15:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE0zeWhrMnF0VEJDX250U09NQWtmOUltMi1PU3lDb3JNaDBobmdzdEVQZnZnWUJwc29HLWk4M0ZjVG9zX1lTYVlCSWxzbU1JdjFIMHY0SExKX0JnVlBiVDdHaE82N0hVc3FJM3lHYjlJbEwxMGp1</guid></item><item><title>专家说，走路更快，活得更久- KSL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxOUkZCaENNR1ZDejNCLVk2X1JWMnIxMHVvY0toSXd2SDhYYTZzY2xjZ0RuQ2NDb3RnTXZ2WVVkQlpuMUlHdkktVXdvam14SWNia0hPUld4NVEtdXhRdEpkM2xBZlFocUV1enlKNENIajB1MUdmc21JaGxPSTlINC11Z1NMdlM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA — Too busy to go to the gym? Don't worry — you can stay healthy by incorporating at least 15 minutes of fast walking into your everyday routine, new research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, it's recommended that people commit to 150 minutes of moderate activity per week to see sufficient health benefits, said Dr. Wei Zheng, the study's corresponding author. But if 150 minutes is too difficult to manage, fast walking a minimum of 15 minutes every day can have the same health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zheng and a team of researchers recruited mostly low-income and Black study participants from 2002 to 2009, according to the study published in the &lt;a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(25)00230-2/fulltext" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;American Journal of Preventive Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. The nearly 85,000 participants were given a comprehensive questionnaire about their exercise habits, average time spent working out, walking speed and health. Then the participants completed a questionnaire about 16 years later, and the analysis began in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know "fast &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51188871" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; is good compared to slow walking," but there isn't much research on how many minutes you should spend fast walking on average, said Zheng, director of the Vanderbilt Epidemiology Center and the Anne Potter Wilson Professor in Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;We've actually known for quite a long time that walking speed correlates with outcomes, meaning the faster you walk, the better you do. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;–Dr. Andrew Freeman, National Jewish Health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, study participants who fast walked for at least 15 minutes every day saw a nearly 20% reduction in premature death compared with a 4% reduction among participants who walked slowly for a total of more than three hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've actually known for quite a long time that walking speed correlates with outcomes, meaning the faster you walk, the better you do. And it certainly makes sense, because you can imagine, somebody who's in really bad shape is probably not going to be able to walk very quickly," said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. He was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How walking can impact your health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking has health benefits, such as managing weight and sugar intake, reducing the risk of cancer, easing joint pain and boosting immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health experts "know that when people are exercising regularly, blood vessels can relax and dilate a bit better. And then we also know that exercise is quite good for cholesterol, so it seems to lower cholesterol. And then overall, it reduces the risk of cancer and things that would otherwise hurt people," Freeman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking daily can also lower the risk of dementia or cognitive decline in people predisposed to developing Alzheimer's, according to recent research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engaging in daily physical activity, such as walking, promotes better sleep and reduces inflammation, which improves brain structure, according to the Piedmont Medical Center in South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to emphasize that these exercises, no matter slow or fast, all confirm some benefit," Zheng said. "But what we find is that fast walking as little as 15 minutes a day confirms substantiated benefits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast walking has been found to have specific benefits, such as decreasing the risk of heart failure, arrhythmias and Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(T)he thought is that exercise has a very big effect on blood pressure, as you may know, and blood pressure, it is one of the more exponential risk factors that we have, for roughly every 20 points blood pressure goes above 120 (what is considered normal or healthy), the risk of a cardiac event roughly doubles," Freeman said. "So, it's a super potent and exponential risk factor, and we know that regular exercise lowers that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Get your heart pumping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, you can tell you're fast walking when you're able to talk but not sing, according to the United Kingdom's National Health Service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can increase your walking pace by a couple of steps and track it with a metronome, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/16/health/walking-cadence-mobility-speed-endurance-wellness" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;July study.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I usually recommend that they get up before work, and they go for a brisk walk or a bike or a swim, or they do some high-intensity interval training, whatever it is that they're into," Freeman said. People can go to "a rec center, or they walk outside, if it is safe, or whatever it may be, and just weave it into their day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following good &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/perfecting-your-walking-technique#:~:text=Eyes%20up.,reduce%20your%20risk%20of%20injury." rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;walking form&lt;/a&gt;, such as standing tall with your shoulders back and swinging your arms, can help prevent backaches, make it easy to breathe and keep you balanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Walking is a full-body movement. It is not just about your lower body. It's not just one step in front of the one foot in front of the other," said Dana Santas, a certified strength and conditioning specialist and mind-body coach in professional sports, in a previous article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your arm swing is a huge part involved in the mechanics of walking. So, you want to have an arm swing that's coordinated with your foot movement, so it's opposing," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to take it up a notch? When doing any form of exercise, try to practice conscious or nasal breathing, which is when you inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. This helps regulate blood pressure and can prevent hypertension, according to Santas&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Air conditioning can feel heaven-sent on hot summer days. It keeps temperatures comfortable and controls humidity, making indoor environments tolerable even on the most brutally warm days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some people avoid using air conditioning (AC) no matter how hot it gets outside, out of fear that it will make them sick. While this may sound far-fetched to some, as a microbiologist I can say this fear isn’t altogether unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/what-to-know-about-a-surge-of-walking-pneumonia-cases-among-young-children"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; What to know about a surge of walking pneumonia cases among young children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an air conditioning system malfunctions or isn’t properly maintained, it can become contaminated with infectious microbes. This can turn your AC unit into a potential source of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8438419/"&gt;numerous airborne infections&lt;/a&gt; – ranging from the common cold to pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sick buildings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sick-building-syndrome/"&gt;“Sick building syndrome”&lt;/a&gt; is the general name for symptoms that can develop after spending extended periods of time in air-conditioned environments. Symptoms can include headaches, dizziness, congested or runny nose, persistent cough or wheeze, skin irritation or rashes, trouble focusing on work and tiredness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The condition tends to occur in people who work in office settings, but can happen to anyone who spends extended periods of time in air-conditioned buildings such as hospitals. The symptoms of sick building syndrome tend to get worse the longer you’re in a particular building, and are alleviated after you leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/how-germy-is-the-public-pool-an-infectious-disease-expert-weighs-in"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; How germy is the public pool? An infectious disease expert weighs in&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10257240"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; from India compared 200 healthy adults who worked at least six-to-eight hours per day in an air-conditioned office with 200 healthy adults who didn’t work in AC. The AC group experienced more symptoms consistent with sick building syndrome over the two-year study period – particularly a higher prevalence of allergies. Importantly, clinical tests showed those who were exposed to AC had poorer lung function and were absent from work more often, compared with the non-AC group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other studies have confirmed that AC office workers have a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9518424/"&gt;higher prevalence of sick building syndrome&lt;/a&gt; than those who do not work in an air-conditioned environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s suspected that one cause of sick building syndrome is &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/occmed/article/74/Supplement_1/0/7707269"&gt;malfunctioning air conditioners&lt;/a&gt;. When an AC unit isn’t working properly, it can release allergens, chemicals and airborne microorganisms into the air that it would normally have trapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/why-is-my-city-under-a-boil-water-advisory"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Why is my city under a boil water advisory?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malfunctioning air conditioners can also &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1352231099002745"&gt;release chemical vapours&lt;/a&gt; from AC cleaning products or &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/snap/refrigerant-safety"&gt;refrigerants&lt;/a&gt; into the building’s air. Chemicals such as benzene, formaldehyde and toluene are toxic and can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9171686/"&gt;irritate the respiratory system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poorly maintained air conditioning systems can also harbour bacterial pathogens which can cause serious infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legionella pneumophila&lt;/em&gt; is the bacteria that causes &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/about/index.html"&gt;Legionnaires’ disease&lt;/a&gt; – a lung infection contracted from inhaling droplets of water containing these bacteria. They tend to grow in water-rich environments such as hot tubs or air conditioning systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Legionella infection is most often caught in communal places such as hotels, hospitals or offices, where the bacteria have contaminated the water supply. Symptoms of &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/legionnaires-disease/"&gt;Legionnaires’ disease&lt;/a&gt; are similar to pneumonia, causing coughing, shortness of breath, chest discomfort, fever and general flu-like symptoms. Symptoms usually begin to show between two and 14 days after being exposed to &lt;em&gt;Legionella&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/caused-legionnaires-disease-outbreak-nyc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; What caused the Legionnaires’ disease outbreak in NYC?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/causes/index.html"&gt;Legionella infections&lt;/a&gt; can be life-threatening and often require hospitalisation. Recovery can take several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fungal and viral infections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accumulation of dust and moisture inside air conditioning systems can also create the right conditions for other infectious microbes to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, research on hospital AC systems has found that fungi such as &lt;em&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Penicillium&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cladosporium&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rhizopusspecies&lt;/em&gt; commonly accumulate within the water-rich areas of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8438419/"&gt;hospital ventilation systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/why-coughs-can-linger-long-after-you-recover-from-an-illness"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Why coughs can linger long after you recover from an illness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These fungal infections can be serious in vulnerable patients such as those who are immunocompromised, have had an organ transplant or are on dialysis – as well as babies who were born premature. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/infection-control/hcp/environmental-control/air.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; causes pneumonia, abscesses of the lungs, brain, liver, spleen, kidneys and skin, and can also infect burns and wounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of &lt;a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/lungs-and-airways/pneumonia/"&gt;fungal infections&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/aspergillosis/"&gt;mostly respiratory&lt;/a&gt; and include persistent wheeze or cough, fever, shortness of breath, tiredness and unexplained loss of weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viral infections can also be caught from air conditioning. One &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S120197121730259X"&gt;case study&lt;/a&gt; revealed that children in a Chinese kindergarten class were infected with the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/index.html"&gt;norovirus pathogen&lt;/a&gt; from their AC system. This caused 20 students to experience the stomach flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While norovirus is usually transmitted through close contact with an infected person or after touching a contaminated surface, in this instance it was confirmed, unusually, that the virus was spread through the air – originating from the air conditioning unit in a class restroom. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6160878/#:%7E:text=Vaporized%20material%20from%20infected%20person's,3%2C%207%2C%2015%5D"&gt;Several other cases&lt;/a&gt; of norovirus being spread this way have been reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/forget-sharks-7-things-water-swimmers-actually-fear"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Forget sharks: 7 things in the water swimmers should actually fear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, air conditioners can also help &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ventilation/about/index.html"&gt;stop the spread of airborne viruses&lt;/a&gt;. Research shows AC units that are regularly maintained and sanitised can reduce circulating levels of common viruses, &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/indoor-air-homes-and-coronavirus-covid-19"&gt;including COVID&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason AC may increase your risk of catching an infection is due to the way air conditioners control humidity levels. This makes inside air drier than outside air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending extended periods of time in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412018320725"&gt;low-humidity environments&lt;/a&gt; can dry out the mucus membranes in your nose and throat. This can affect how well they prevent bacteria and fungi from getting in your body – and can leave you more vulnerable to developing a &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/5AB6706237E7ED5AF05FC19B9D4A88FC/S2633289223000017a.pdf/mouth-breathing-dry-air-and-low-water-permeation-promote-inflammation-and-activate-neural-pathways-by-osmotic-stresses-acting-on-airway-lining-mucus.pdf"&gt;deep-tissue infection&lt;/a&gt; of the sinuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air conditioners are designed to filter air contaminants, fungal spores, bacteria and viruses, preventing them from entering the air we breathe indoors. But this protective shield can be compromised if a system’s filter is old or dirty, or if the system isn’t cleaned. Ensuring good AC maintenance is essential in preventing &lt;a href="https://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/view/ventilation-risk-health-care-associated-infections"&gt;air-conditioner-acquired infections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The pill was actually made up entirely of a synthetic opioid called nitazene that can be 40 times deadlier &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13911513/reason-fentanyl-deaths-decreasing-washington-state.html"&gt;than fentanyl&lt;/a&gt;. Lucci overdosed and died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since then, McCallister has heard from other parents in her native Houston, Texas, who say their children’s deaths were also &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14582955/drug-nitazene-heroin-UK-US-fentanyl-epidemic.html"&gt;linked to nitazenes&lt;/a&gt;, a class of drugs that health officials worry could drive the next phase in the overdose epidemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘In the past two weeks, I would say even the last week, with the interest in Lucci's story, other parents are reaching out to me because they've lost their children,’ she told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Houston has been hit particularly hard by the arrival of nitazene, which first began infiltrating the US drug supply in 2019. From May 2024 to 2025 alone, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-5a3afa80-788a-11f0-8e94-9fe044075bc6"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; DEA agents reported 15 nitazene overdose deaths in people aged 17 to 59, the highest death count since the first drug seizure in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lucci’s friend Hunter Clement, 21, was one of them. He took two pills sold to him in April, one a counterfeit Xanax and the other a counterfeit Percocet. He also overdosed and died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most standard post-mortem drug screens do not test for nitazenes, and the local authorities in Houston did not have the type of comprehensive panel that would detect nitazenes &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, the two moms took the pills they found near their sons’ bodies to a specialized lab for testing. When the results came back as nitazenes, the women said they’d never heard of the drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Lucci Reyes-McCallister, pictured with his mother Grey, unknowingly took a pill made up of a synthetic opioid rarely found in the drug supply before 2019. He died at age 22&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I'll never forget when the detective called,’ McCallister, who has a background in pharmaceuticals, said. ‘I had him repeat the name twice. I had him spell it two or three times. I was looking for an active ingredient in there, something I recognized the name of, and I didn't.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What they learned was that the pill that killed Lucci was pure nitazene. There was no fentanyl and zero trace of Xanax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In hindsight, McCallister suspects this was not Lucci's first encounter with nitazene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, Lucci took a pill and suffered a non-fatal overdose that required five doses of Narcan, the antidote for opioid overdoses, to bring him back to life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;McCallister thinks nitazene had been pressed into that pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘He bounced back because he was terrified, and he was doing better,’ McCallister said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I think the thing with people of that age is you want to have a social life, you hang out with people, and that usually involves alcohol, and I think that's when the inhibitions slip.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;McCallister is currently working with law enforcement to find out where her son had been buying the counterfeit pills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lucci is pictured at his high school graduation. He aspired to be a tattoo artist and had been working in a prestigious apprenticeship when he died&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Lucci and his mother were very close. McCallister talked to him 'a gazillion times a day,' she told the Daily Mail, exchanging texts, calls, memes, and silly videos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically, Lucci’s family checked in with him ‘a gazillion times a day,’ his mom said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family exchanged calls, texts, memes, and funny videos. But on the day he overdosed, they began to worry when they hadn’t heard from him for hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was found dead in his apartment on January 26 with two pills nearby pressed to look like Xanax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘He had a fulfilling life. He had a family that loved him. He was doing great,’ his mother said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Clement, mourning her son’s death a few months later, learned of Lucci’s passing, she immediately connected the two. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She reached out to McCallister and, from there, had two pills left near Hunter’s body tested more comprehensively for the toxins that a standard screen could not detect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clement found Hunter one April evening after a long day at work. Hunter had come home the night before, apparently drunk, sparking worry in his parents. Perhaps he had taken half a pill, she thought at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like Lucci, Hunter had been doing well. He had been introduced to the pills by a friend the previous year, likely not knowing they could contain fentanyl or nitazenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He had a few rough months, but he never overdosed or needed Narcan. And his personality hadn’t changed much. From December through his death in April, he was the same son they knew and loved, his mom told the Daily Mail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hunter took what were sold to him as Xanax and Percocet and fatally overdosed in April at 21. Further testing found the pills were made up entirely of the same nitazene that killed Lucci&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hunter is shown third from left surrounded by his family. According to his mother, he was his niece's favorite uncle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But that night in April, his parents feared Hunter had made a sharp turn down the wrong path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The next day, when I went to work, he was sleeping. My husband went and checked on him around noon. He was sitting up in his bed,’ Clement told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And then, when I got home, I found him in his bed, and he must have taken one of each [counterfeit oxycodone and counterfeit Xanax].’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first version, or analog, of nitazenes was developed in the 1950s as a potent opioid painkiller, but was never used in medicine due to its dangerously high overdose risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But still deadlier analogs of the original, like N-pyrrolidino protonitazene, which killed Lucci and Hunter, have resurfaced since 2019, infiltrating the illicit drug supplies of Europe, the UK, and the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Andrew Renna, Assistant Port Director for Cargo Operations at JFK Airport in New York City told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cbp.gov/frontline/buyer-beware-bad-actors-exploit-de-minimis-shipments"&gt;US Customs and Border Protection&lt;/a&gt; in May: ‘Earlier this month, we seized almost a pound of nitazene that was going to a private residence in South Carolina. It was shipped from the United Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Unfortunately, here at JFK, we’re seeing xylazine and nitazenes at least a few times a week in quantities ranging from just a few grams to upwards of a pound or more.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hunter's mother said he had a great sense of humor and took his role as an uncle very seriously. He had been doing well in the months leading up to his sudden overdose&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US is still steeped in a years-long opioid overdose crisis that is believed to have killed more than 800,000 people since it began in 1999. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to a report from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, the US overdose death rate decreased by four from 2022 to 2023, dropping from 32.6 to 31.3 fatalities per 100,000 people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The decline is promising, but the increasing danger of another deadly synthetic opiate has overshadowed public health officials' optimism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With the threat of a new wave of the opioid epidemic taking form, parents like McCallister and Clement have channeled their grief into an awareness campaign by sharing their sons’ stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Sadly, it just takes one pill, or one line of something, or, heaven forbid, in the future, a hit off of a vape,’ McCallister said. ‘I mean, this is very dangerous territory we're wading into.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 17:56:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>在曾经被遗弃的德克萨斯州小镇，甜蜜的复兴之花再次绽放--MySA</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxOcEl3VlQ0c1NrZ3dDUzF5RTlYakVNbmE3RWdKM0pnYUtWUlZHUkRldVpYWnM4cldnTFpRLUNvTXVlTVR2MnR3QTVOdmEtQ2R0ZWdfVWIwM3RhZ2luNEhFenNLOHZxdWVyWTVZQ3hrQW9XMnRadXRfQ2RwN2ViMGxsWUg4Q2czdUsyZnptVUNDMUQ2b0VOVHFFZg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="rel"&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:-mx40 lg:-mx56 x100vw sm:cw-80 lg:cw-112 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exterior of the Waring Market, which offers gallery space for local artists.

Around its large eyes come black slithering masses that twist and writhe like Cthulhu's tentacles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Under its mouth extend two dark, forked barbs, a veritable pair of outgrowths that resemble vampire fangs, suggesting it has truly become a monster. With the transformation complete, the creature emerges from the brush to reveal, not a Lovecraftian horror beyond human comprehension, but a common cottontail rabbit. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This particular species, ubiquitous in Wyoming, is experiencing the effects of a seasonal surge in Shope papilloma virus, a disease that causes the growth of dark structures made of keratin around a rabbit’s face and neck. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Images of rabbits with this bizarre affliction have made waves across social media, with many likening their strange visage to that of Frankenstein’s monster or an undead zombie.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While no infected rabbits have been spotted in Wyoming, some have made their way as close as Fort Collins, Colorado, sparking speculation they may soon cross over into the Cowboy State. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1uhbe1z3 _1uhbe1z2 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;figure class="n1n9p21"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="p8ohjc5 p8ohjc0 n1n9p22 _10mr6051 vbxqml4 _10mr60539"&gt;Sightings of “zombie rabbits” near Fort Collins have sparked a wave of speculation about what those horned critters are. Turns out they have a rare disease that causes growths all over — and likely the origin of Wyoming’s mythical jackalopes. (Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s Up, Doc?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Laurie Hess, an exotic pet veterinarian in Bedford Hills, New York, told Cowboy State Daily the disease is normally not life threatening to a rabbit. She said the emergence of these horn-like growths is similar to the way warts appear in humans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s been around forever, it’s a virus, it’s nothing new and it’s being sensationalized because people are seeing what it can do to wild rabbits,” Hess said via phone. “These rabbits look freakish but usually these [growths] are benign things, sometimes they will kind of fall off and go away.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s just the way the body reacts and walls off this virus as it divides, and it forms this pile of protein that happens to be in the shape of a horn,” Hess added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In rare exceptions the growths can develop into malignant cancer but are otherwise harmless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The good news is, it’s not transmittable to people, it’s not transmittable to other pets other than rabbits,” Hess said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hess said the appearance of such growths is specific only to rabbits, even though different types of papilloma viruses exist in other species, including humans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the strange twisting horns caused by Shope papilloma virus have drawn comparisons to the zombie Cordyceps fungus popularized by the HBO series “The Last of Us,” Hess said the disease is something entirely different.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Fungus is an environmental thing,” Hess said. “Even athlete’s foot is a fungus, it lives in the gym in the drain, and you step in it and you get it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shope papilloma virus“is not like a plague spread through the air, it’s not like that, it’s not like COVID where you breathe the same air as someone with COVID has,” she added. “It has to be a transmission and it’s usually through insects.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A late summer resurgence of mosquitos, therefore, creates prime conditions for the spread of the shocking malady. Hess added that owners of exotic pets, such as rabbits, should make sure to bring them to the vet at least once per year to monitor for similar strange diseases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Though Wyoming has yet to see any infected rabbits, the state Game and Fish Department confirmed to Cowboy State Daily in an email that it is monitoring the rabbits’ movement through northern Colorado. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;State officials do not have plans to intervene should the rabbits cross into the state, though, as Shope papilloma virus does not threaten any local wildlife.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“While this infection does look alarming, it is not fatal unless it interferes with the animals' ability to eat and drink,” Public Information Officer Amanda Fry wrote via email “We do recommend that you do not handle these animals, and give them space if you come across one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Ultimately it is not a serious threat to rabbit populations, nor their role in ecosystems.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1uhbe1z3 _1uhbe1z2 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;figure class="n1n9p21"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="p8ohjc5 p8ohjc0 n1n9p22 _10mr6051 vbxqml4 _10mr60539"&gt;The legend of the jackalope might have started with pioneers in the 1800s seeing rabbits infected with viruses that can cause horn-like growths. (CSD File)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legend Of The Jackalope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even though horned rabbit sightings can be explained by science, that doesn’t stop some Wyomingites from speculating they are connected to a greater mythos rooted deep in state history.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The city of Douglas, Wyoming, &lt;a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2023/06/11/jonesing-for-jackalopes-douglas-cant-get-enough-of-these-mythical-antler-rabbits/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;credits the Herrick family&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with the invention of the mythical jackalope, an animal with a jackrabbit's body and the antlers of an antelope. Luke Herrick, a third-generation taxidermist in Douglas, said the legend originated from his grandpa Doug, who one evening happened to toss a rabbit carcass next to a pair of antlers on the floor of his shed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“They decided to try mounting one up,” Herrick told Cowboy State Daily via phone. “My great grandmother, Doula Herrick, she was the one that named it. She said ‘let’s call it a jackalope.’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mounted Jackalopes, Herrick added, have since become a signature offering of Douglas’s Herrick Big Horn Taxidermy. Herrick said a typical jackalope mount will cost about $55 to create, which he can then sell in his shop for $155.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We sell twice as much [jackalopes] as we do our little animals,” Herrick said. “I took it over from my dad and he was doing 3,000 jackalopes a year and he still couldn’t keep up.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While Herrick said he was unfamiliar with a connection between jackalopes and Shope papilloma virus, he said the legendary creatures feel as real to him as any other animal he mounts in his shop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It almost sounds funny but they’re real to us, to me,” Herrick said. “I grew up with it ever since I was born.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1uhbe1z3 _1uhbe1z2 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;div class="_1eyampx0"&gt;&lt;div class="splide"&gt;&lt;div class="splide__track"&gt;&lt;ul class="splide__list"&gt;&lt;li class="splide__slide n1n9p20"&gt;&lt;figure class="n1n9p21"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="p8ohjc5 p8ohjc0 n1n9p22 _10mr6051 vbxqml4 _10mr60539"&gt;Douglas, Wyoming, has adopted the Cowboy State's mythical critter — the jackalope — claiming it was created by a local taxidermist in 1939.

It doesn’t deliver jellybeans and eggs like its cousin the Easter Bunny, but instead sings cowboy songs, drinks whiskey and mates only during electrical storms. Rose said this mystique likely contributes to the jackalope’s staying power throughout the years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think people just love mythology,” she said. “It’s kind of a cool thing and you’ve got Greek mythology, you’ve got Loch Ness Monster, you’ve got all these things out there and it just grows.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We have seen in the past couple of years people coming, just like they go look for The Mothman,” she added. “They’ll go on vacations based on these mythical creatures, so we have had people come here just to see the jackalope.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The legend has since become a major part of Douglas’s identity, even featuring the jackalope on part of its city emblem. Rose said the museum where she works produces an array of touristy merchandise from jackalope milk to tongue-in-cheek jackalope hunting licenses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The license, issued by the City of Douglas, permits the bearer to hunt jackalope from 12-2 a.m. on “June 31.” Different iterations of the license will sometimes list penalties for noncompliance, such as the 2022 version which threatens a $13 fine or “13 months hard play in Douglas, Wyoming.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Herrick said the joke sometimes goes over the heads of eager hunters who set out in search of the rare game anyways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I know one instance, a guy was out hunting, shotgun out, and he was walking through the sagebrush looking for a jackalope and a game warden pulled up and asked him what he was doing,” Herrick said. “The game warden told him the truth and that guy was pretty p—ed off.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While it remains possible a hunter could mistake a rabbit with the Shope papilloma virus for a jackalope, hunters aren’t allowed to shoot it. Jackalope season, according to the city of Douglas, ended more than a month ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cottontail rabbit season, meanwhile, starts on Sept. 1 in Wyoming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jackson Walker can be reached at: News@CowboyStateDaily.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Cowboy State Daily</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 17:54:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxPUHY1QUJiSkVQU19uUnM2LTVXdnM5bkp3T05iVWc4dUhlRXN5MTlGdVdNSmFIOW05eTVVVEktSWQ1MEtySTc2b01rdWU3c0g0eEp6THRQQXFLaWZtbDlCaGZFY1J1YU9yTGtJQTMxNk1kY1ktcnJTN01fSmFxWXB2WnRrc1VjS2pRLUdydUd6WENqYkVQTFBnZ1FlQzV6eW05WXBkMmR5NnU3T1ByM1pvb3FVZ0I</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法， 7个狡猾的迹象表明您可能没有摄入足够的蛋白质- EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPYzl4VzZKN1lvN3U1SU9Dby14NjZKLUFEd3JiRC10N09XY0VMUWIzMWtfblkyaVdLMlhHTTh1YlJvQzJHRWowU19iU0ctcFhPc0FmM3RzRlZVRi0wSWNDSXByeVRvVlo1VzNLYnpnUm9OZ3RmdUJxdFBWOVJzTUd5TGF5YXBKUVlu?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most of us eat enough protein. But there are exceptions, like illness or intense exercise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When your body doesn’t get the protein it needs, it sends you subtle hints. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These include bad mood, frequent illness or trouble bouncing back from exercise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sometimes, getting the nutrients you need can feel like trying to balance a seesaw. Just when one side is steady, the other starts to tip out of balance. Protein is a perfect example. While most of us are meeting the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290496/this-is-how-much-protein-you-need-to-eat-every-day/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;minimum protein requirements&lt;/a&gt;, that doesn’t mean we’re always consuming enough &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/proteins-to-eat-every-week-11684415" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high-quality protein&lt;/a&gt; to match our activity level, support our unique health needs or accommodate dietary restrictions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news is that your body will often send you hints that you’re not getting enough of this nutrient. However, they’re not always obvious, and some of them may be downright weird. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, we asked dietitians to share the under-the-radar signals that you need more protein. Here’s what to look out for.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-youre-always-hungry"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. You’re Always Hungry &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ever finish a snack or meal but still feel unsatisfied? Or, maybe you’re hungry again soon after you’ve eaten? “Not eating enough protein can leave you &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031222/reasons-why-you-wake-up-hungry/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;feeling hungry&lt;/a&gt;,” says &lt;a href="http://djblatner.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dawn Jackson Blatner, RDN, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;. “Protein boosts hormones that make you feel full, so skimping on protein can leave you constantly reaching for snacks.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.activeeatingadvice.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Leslie Bonci, M.P.H., RDN, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;, agrees, explaining that higher-protein diets increase the secretion of the appetite-suppressing hormones. This can help you feel more satisfied after meals. And if your goal is weight or fat loss, she says, a “protein prescription” can help control hunger and appetite between meals and preserve muscle mass in the process. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-youre-always-getting-sick"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. You’re Always Getting Sick &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “If you get sick more often than normal, it may be another sign of inadequate protein intake,” says &lt;a href="http://kellyjonesnutrition.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kelly Jones, M.S., RD, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;. After you eat protein, your body breaks it down into &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-protein-and-its-benefits-11732679" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;protein building blocks&lt;/a&gt; called amino acids, she says. These amino acids are then used to create immune cells and antibodies, which are your body’s front-line defenders against illness. But if there are not enough amino acids on tap, your immune system may not be able to do its job effectively. This may raise your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7594934/how-to-actually-boost-your-immunity-and-not-get-sick/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;risk of catching colds&lt;/a&gt; or other infections. “It may also take you longer to bounce back when you do get sick,” she adds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-your-muscles-ache"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Your Muscles Ache &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If your post-exercise &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sore-from-workout-what-to-do-to-feel-better-11721347" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;muscle soreness&lt;/a&gt; is an issue, you may want to consider your protein intake. “Consistent muscle soreness or weakness, especially if you’re not heavily training, may hint at low protein, since it’s needed for muscle repair and recovery,” says &lt;a href="http://www.nutritionfp.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tony Castillo, M.S., RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;. When your body doesn’t get sufficient protein from food, it may start to break down muscle tissue to get the protein it needs.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This, in turn, may translate to sore muscles. Fortunately, research has found that consuming protein during or after exercise may &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-drinks-for-sore-muscles-8364146" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;speed muscle repair&lt;/a&gt; and alleviate some of those muscle aches.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-youre-not-hitting-your-fitness-goals"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. You’re Not Hitting Your Fitness Goals  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;If you're putting in the work with a fitness routine that involves both cardiorespiratory and strength training, but not seeing improvements in muscle strength or body composition, inadequate protein intake may be the culprit,” says Jones. That’s because active people have higher calorie and protein needs. However, if those needs aren’t being met, your body may burn the protein you eat for energy instead of using it to build muscle, she explains. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-you-heal-slowly"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. You Heal Slowly &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether it’s after surgery, an injury or even a scrape, there are times when we all need to heal. During these periods, our protein needs increase. “If protein intake is inadequate, you won’t have #alltheheals,” says Bonci. Without enough protein, your body will lack the raw materials that it needs for tissue repair and remodeling. All of this can delay recovery and healing, which might be otherwise prevented by consuming enough protein, she explains.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-your-hair-skin-and-nails-dont-look-healthy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Your Hair, Skin and Nails Don’t Look Healthy  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Want the secret to lustrous hair, glowing skin and resilient nails? It might be more protein. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Not eating enough protein may cause your hair to thin and fall out faster,” says Blatner. “Protein is essential for building strong, healthy strands, and [many] protein foods also contain iron and zinc, which support hair health.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Similarly, if your nails are splitting, peeling or breaking more easily than usual, it could point to inadequate protein intake, says Castillo. “Protein is a key building block for keratin, the main structural component of nails.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, poor nutrition in general can have a marked impact on nail health. So, a well-balanced diet with adequate protein can only help.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Jones notes that poor skin health can also be a sign you’re not getting enough protein. That’s because your skin is composed of structural proteins like collagen and elastin, which keep it smooth and firm. Without enough protein to supply the amino acids your body needs to make these structural proteins, your skin may start to sag, and fine lines and wrinkles may set in.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-7-youre-feeling-down-in-the-dumps"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 7. You’re Feeling Down in the Dumps &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’ve got a case of the grumpies, it might be your diet.  “Increasing your protein intake by even 10% may improve your mood and help get your emotions back on track,“ explains Blatner. While the reasons aren’t entirely understood, one study suggests that eating additional protein may help your body produce more of the mood-boosting hormone serotonin.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s not the only way protein may help balance your mood. This nutrient also helps stabilize blood sugar levels, which may prevent the mood dips that often accompany blood sugar crashes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

When this happens, some weird signs may appear. Sneaky signs that you’re not getting enough protein are feeling hungry all the time, muscle soreness, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292168/5-weird-signs-you-may-not-be-getting-enough-protein/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lackluster hair, skin and nails&lt;/a&gt;. You may also have difficulty hitting your fitness goals, bouncing back from injury or illness and even feel more depressed or moody. If you notice any of these signs, it’s a good idea to check in with your health care provider or a registered dietitian nutritionist. They can take a close look at your diet to see if insufficient protein is what’s causing your strange symptoms, and help you develop a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;healthy eating plan&lt;/a&gt; to get the protein you need to feel your best.&lt;br&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxh30001b3b79obu6o8qk@published"&gt;I’m a 45-year-old gay man working through complex sexual trauma and am relatively new to sobriety. For the first time in years, I feel mentally ready to connect with others, and I’m seeking a casual friends-with-benefits situation—something low-pressure but meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxh76001c3b79hrnxv6nk@published"&gt;Here’s the issue: receiving oral sex is physically difficult for me. I’m well-endowed, and new partners often get excited to go down on me—but I tend to go soft during the act, no matter what I’ve tried (even Viagra). It’s not about shame or lack of attraction. It’s a trauma response. But of course, I can’t unpack all that with a hookup I just met, and many men take my reaction personally.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxhb0001d3b79zahtfh88@published"&gt;It’s a similar story with giving oral. I’m a bottom and want to please my partners, but the act can trigger me. I want to be upfront, but not in a way that overshares or kills the mood. How can I communicate this early on in a way that’s honest but doesn’t derail the whole experience?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxhld001g3b79tg296rft@published"&gt;It is reasonable, de rigueur even, to spell out what you are (and, in some cases, aren’t) into before a hookup. If you’re meeting guys via apps, this can be as simple as including info in your profile (“No oral, only anal,” for example), or letting them know during your coordinating chat. If you’re meeting guys in person, a brief conversation explaining your boundaries should also suffice.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="197" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxhpf001h3b79tmsc0tft@published"&gt;However, know that this may derail the experience for some potential partners. I think your main task is getting to be OK with that. If people can’t abide by your boundaries, they aren’t worth your time. People may filter themselves out if they’re looking for oral, and a lot of them will be. Guys, even the top-identified, may be drooling for your big dick, but bottoms who don’t want their dicks played with are fairly common. That’s not going to shatter a seasoned top’s understanding of the universe. I think you’ll find that what is more of a dealbreaker is you not wanting to suck, but I think you’ll still do fine even with that boundary stated up front. Anecdotally, I see tops in hook-up profiles advertising that they just want anal. They are out there. As with any interest/disinterest that deviates from the status quo, this is just about finding your people, and that process involves rejecting others as you shuffle through. Just be patient and know that if anyone turns you down as a result of your interests, it’s not personal. After all, they won’t yet know you well enough for it to be personal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxhvo001j3b79k2qxq7uv@published"&gt;I am a gay man in my mid 30s in a committed, monogamous relationship with an amazing man. Prior to dating him, I lived a very sexually active life and was very involved in the hookup culture. While I don’t judge others for the choices they make when it comes to their sex life, I’ve come to realize my promiscuity was born from a desire to be accepted and from a desire for intimacy. It has taken a lot of work to work through the shame and the guilt I have felt from abusing my body and giving it away so liberally, but I’m slowly accepting my past as a part of my journey of growth and looking at my past self through kinder eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="141" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxhyx001k3b79lozavva8@published"&gt;With all that said, my partner and I have a very active sex life. Sex with him is by far the best I’ve ever experienced and it seems like each time he’s coming up with new ways to please me. On the other hand, while I have had quite a few hook ups in the past, they really haven’t required me to get very creative or to put in a lot of work. My partner only tops so I am the bottom in our relationship. Aside from riding, what other positions would work well for a bottom looking to please their partner? Also, while I love giving him oral, his penis does curve which triggers my gag reflex. I love this man so any suggestions on how to please him in the same way he pleases me would be most appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="214" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxiap001n3b795s38itf7@published"&gt;Congrats on overcoming your velvet rage. You say that tops in the past haven’t &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; you to get creative. Is there anything different about this current relationship that would cause you to feel required to do so? If not, you’re probably fine—some tops just want to be able to do what they will with a hole, little-to-no work required on the bottom’s part other than being receptive. There’s a reason why topping has been traditionally considered the “active” role: It tends to require more physical work. Things don’t &lt;em&gt;have to&lt;/em&gt; be this way, but what it could mean for you is riding low expectations all the way to mutual orgasms for you and your partner. I get the sense that you want to surprise your partner with new tricks, but in terms of the vibe and actual sensation, these may not be his thing. You would do better to have a conversation ahead of time about whether or not there’s anything he’d like you to do. The fact of the matter is that any and all positions could work well for a bottom looking to please their partner … depending on the top’s taste and the bottom’s willingness. You wrote a rave review of your sex life so this might be a don’t-fix-what-isn’t-broken situation.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="165" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxijo001o3b79mk32l43y@published"&gt;That said, you could try being the one to thrust in positions other than you on top—for example, if he’s in you from behind, you could move back and forth on his dick instead of him doing that work. See if he’s into it. And for oral, try coming at him another way. If you tend to approach from below (as in, him standing while you are kneeling or even if he’s lying down and you situate yourself between his legs), instead approach from above. Have him lay on his back and approach from the top (as if in a 69 position). That can help with accommodating, depending on his curve. You could also try laying on the bed with your head over the edge and have him thrust into you. Again, it will depend on his curve but that could help you take him (tell him to go easy, especially at first because an overeager top thrusting deep can also make things more difficult).&lt;/p&gt;

When you add that to busyness, dealing with childcare, and general exhaustion, we end up having infrequent sex that leaves one of us unhappy. I’m usually a hot and ready girl, but I’m just not in the mood given everything, and the pattern of me not being able to get turned on has really hurt my partner’s feelings and led to her feeling blamed and rejected. I just want to get back to feeling horny and having excellent sex! Help!&lt;/p&gt;

You have generously accommodated your partner’s limitations, but it seems that it’s at your expense. More tinkering may be in order. The troubleshooting that needs to be done is figuring out how you can mitigate your partner’s pain while facilitating your pleasure. This will require working together closely, and that I think might be the biggest hurdle here.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="178" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxvts00223b79xyn2o4sr@published"&gt;It’s going to be hard to collaborate in such an intimate space when there are negative feelings pervading it. It’s likely that your issues here go way beyond positioning—the shame that has entered your bedroom could be just as big of an impediment, if not more so. Your partner’s reactions have not been ideal. It seems that she is honest in her expression, but she hasn’t been extending the kind of sensitivity that you need. She doesn’t have to &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; your squirting but she should accept it as part of your body’s functionality. Not doing so risks you feeling rejected. It seems that she has also taken personally your body’s reaction to the changes you’ve integrated. That’s a choice she doesn’t have to make. It may be disappointing, even upsetting, that your solutions for managing her pain didn’t fall perfectly into place for both of you, but this is a practical matter. At the very least, there’s an alternate interpretation for your response that doesn’t involve your body unconsciously snubbing her. Why is she opting for that one?&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="190" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxvtt00233b791sus6uge@published"&gt;I don’t know what your dynamic is like, and I don’t know how your own behavior and reactions have contributed to it, but what I read was a letter from someone who has done a lot for their partner and it’s still not good enough. Whether you are being treated unfairly or are extremely sensitive to your partner’s feedback (or a little bit of both) is for you to determine. Clarity there will help further conversations on this matter. There may be ways to reconfigure your sex so that you are both satisfied. It won’t necessarily be at the same time—maybe one session is tailored to your pleasure, the next to her’s. Obviously, you may be limited by what her body has the capacity to endure, but she may also need to compromise a bit. Maybe there’s a position that is good for your pleasure/orgasms that isn’t strictly comfortable for her, but also isn’t so uncomfortable as to be unpleasant. If she won’t approach either your conversations about emotions or strategizing for sex with a sense of compromise and collaboration, that’s data. It indicates there’s more work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

Recently, it occurred to me that I might be kind of into my best friend. She’s attractive, and she actually has permission from her boyfriend to hook up with me. I was very flattered but I declined because my husband and I have never talked about that and I felt he’d consider it cheating, which is fair. But, I’ll be honest, I was kind of interested. I’d be open to it with her; only if my husband agreed. I don’t want to hurt his feelings and don’t know what the outcome would be. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/10/friend-permission-hook-up-sex-advice.html"&gt;What should I do?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On August 20, 2025, Russia will launch the Bion-M No. 2 biosatellite atop a Soyuz-2.1b rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, marking a key step in studying the effects of spaceflight on living organisms. As reported by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.space.com/space-exploration/launches-spacecraft/russia-to-launch-75-mice-1-000-fruit-flies-on-aug-20-to-study-spaceflight-effects" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Space.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the spacecraft will carry&lt;strong&gt; 75 mice&lt;/strong&gt;, over &lt;strong&gt;1,000 fruit flies&lt;/strong&gt;, and other biological specimens for a 30-day mission in space, exposing them to high levels of radiation. The goal is to gain insights into the biological effects of space travel, crucial for advancing deep-space missions and understanding long-term impacts on human health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Dubbed “Noah’s Ark” for its diverse payload, the mission also carries lunar simulants—dust and rocks mimicking materials found on the moon’s surface. These simulants will be studied after returning to Earth to assess how they react to space radiation and the vacuum of space, aiding plans for future lunar construction. The mission aims to gather critical data on microgravity and radiation’s effects on organisms, with potential applications in astronaut health and space medicine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examining the Impact of Space Radiation on Mice and Other Organisms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the key experiments onboard the &lt;strong&gt;Bion-M No. 2 &lt;/strong&gt;mission involves studying the effects of space radiation on mice. These animals were chosen for the experiment due to their genetic similarity to humans, their short life cycles, and their heightened sensitivity to radiation. This experiment could have wide-reaching implications for human space travel. The mice will be divided into three distinct groups: the first group will live in normal conditions on Earth, the second group will be housed in a simulated flight environment on Earth as a control, and the third group will spend 30 days in orbit. The results will allow researchers to compare the health and biological responses of these groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mice will be monitored closely throughout the mission. Each mouse-carrying unit is equipped with essential systems, including feeding, lighting, ventilation, and waste disposal mechanisms. Specialized &lt;strong&gt;cameras and sensors &lt;/strong&gt;will provide real-time data on the mice’s condition, and some rodents will be implanted with chips to track physiological changes. Upon return to Earth, the researchers will analyze how the mice adapted to space conditions and how they readapted after returning to Earth’s gravity. This data will help scientists understand the long-term effects of spaceflight on living organisms and the potential risks involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lunar Simulants to Test Space Effects on Moon Construction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another significant component of the &lt;strong&gt;Bion-M No. 2&lt;/strong&gt; mission involves the study of lunar simulants. These are materials designed to mimic the dust and rocks found on the moon’s surface, specifically those from the high latitudes. The purpose of this experiment is to assess how space radiation and the vacuum environment affect these materials. The results of this experiment will have broad implications for future moon construction projects, where the ability to use local materials to build structures will be critical for long-term lunar habitation. The lunar simulants will be carefully analyzed after their return to Earth to see how they were altered by their exposure to space conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The collaboration between the &lt;strong&gt;Vernadsky Institute &lt;/strong&gt;and the &lt;strong&gt;IMBP &lt;/strong&gt;in preparing the lunar simulants underscores the importance of this mission in advancing the scientific understanding of space construction materials. The testing of these materials in space will also help scientists determine how radiation and microgravity might affect future building materials used in extraterrestrial environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Spaceflight Impacts the Biological Health of Organisms in Space&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bion-M No. 2 mission &lt;/strong&gt;will collect invaluable data on the biological effects of spaceflight, specifically focusing on how organisms respond to microgravity and radiation. Researchers hope to gain insights into how these factors contribute to the deterioration of biological systems in space. The experiment will provide essential information on how microgravity influences the radiation susceptibility of &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/12/nasa-discovers-massive-planet-bigger-than-earth-with-gas-tied-exclusively-to-living-organisms/" data-type="post" data-id="74921"&gt;living organisms&lt;/a&gt;, which could significantly impact the design of future deep-space missions. The data gathered could also be used to improve astronaut health management strategies, making long-term space travel safer and more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to the mice, more than &lt;strong&gt;1,000 fruit flies&lt;/strong&gt; are also part of the mission. Fruit flies are commonly used in biological experiments due to their relatively short life cycles and well-understood genetic makeup. Their inclusion in this mission provides another level of insight into how space conditions affect organisms at various levels of complexity. With multiple types of organisms being studied, the Bion-M No. 2 mission is expected to yield diverse and comprehensive data on the impact of spaceflight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Role of Radiation in Long-Duration Space Missions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the most crucial elements of the &lt;strong&gt;Bion-M No. 2 mission&lt;/strong&gt; is its focus on radiation. Space radiation is a major concern for long-duration space travel, as it can cause significant harm to living tissues and increase the risk of cancer. The Bion-M No. 2 spacecraft will be placed in a nearly circular orbit with an inclination of around 97 degrees, which will increase the level of cosmic radiation that the organisms are exposed to. This orbital position is specifically chosen to increase radiation exposure by at least an order of magnitude compared to previous missions like Bion-M No. 1. By studying the effects of this radiation on the mice and other specimens, the mission aims to better understand how space radiation influences biological systems and how to mitigate these risks for future missions to the moon, Mars, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The data gathered from this experiment will be critical for developing new technologies and strategies to protect astronauts from the harmful effects of radiation. Space agencies worldwide are keenly aware of the risks posed by space radiation, and the findings from this mission could pave the way for new innovations in space health and safety.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="73" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqb3ct0012o3m6haruencg@published"&gt;Two years ago, I had a conversation with my doctor that remains one of the more unnerving interactions I have ever had. After reviewing the results of a routine blood test, she wanted to know if I had recently experienced any of the following: loss of consciousness, dizziness, confusion, or a seizure. No, no, no, and no. Then she wanted to know: Did I have an altered mental state? At that point, debatable.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="27" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiog001z3b796m59o14w@published"&gt;It turned out I had too little sodium in my blood. As the doctor and I talked, the culprit became clear: My healthy lifestyle was to blame.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="24" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioh00203b79x2trp7xs@published"&gt;I run or go to the gym every day. I try to eat well. I drink plenty of water, especially when I’m working out.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioh00213b79fr9jjx5g@published"&gt;Bombarded by public health warnings about the dangers of not drinking enough, I was terrified of dehydration. Add in &lt;a href="https://slate.com/podcasts/decoder-ring/2021/04/decoder-ring-the-history-of-hydration"&gt;cultural myths&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12376390/#:~:text=Rather%2C%20surveys%20of%20food%20and,and%20certainly%20not%20overtly%20ill."&gt;the 8x8 rule&lt;/a&gt;—eight glasses of 8 ounces of water a day—and lifestyle messaging that drinking more water will help me have better skin, hair, sleep, digestion, you name it, and I was knocking back at least 3 liters of water each day&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; That was on top of my morning coffees, a soda here and there, food (water filled!), and any other drinks I happened to have. Yes, those things count toward water intake.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="11" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioh00223b79wzvc9abe@published"&gt;Altogether, I was getting too much water. Way, way too much.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioh00233b793vr0ujdn@published"&gt;And now I was in danger. In the body along with water is sodium—an essential electrolyte that helps your body maintain its fluid balance, preserves nerve and muscle function, and keeps your heart working, among other things. A healthy sodium level is anywhere between 135 and 145 millimoles per liter of blood. Sodium is naturally found in food, and people who eat a Western diet tend to add quite a bit extra to their meals in the form of table salt too.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="38" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioi00243b79boc8hg1q@published"&gt;But the body’s delicate balance between water and salt can be rapidly thrown out of whack, especially during exercise. At one end of the spectrum is dehydration. At the other is overhydration and hyponatremia, a potentially life-threatening condition.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioi00253b79j0ri6zan@published"&gt;Hyponatremia occurs when a person’s blood sodium levels drop below 135 millimoles per liter of blood. If someone drinks to excess, they effectively dilute their blood sodium levels. At the same time, water starts to leak into their body’s tissues, causing them to swell, explains &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tamara-Hew-Butler"&gt;Tamara Hew-Butler&lt;/a&gt;, a Texas-based podiatrist who specializes in treating and studying runners. In severe cases, the brain can start to swell, leading to some of hyponatremia’s core symptoms: confusion, dizziness, the inability to speak properly, and headaches.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioi00263b7923l55u4x@published"&gt;I was training for a half-marathon at the time that I was diagnosed with hyponatremia, and I was easily drinking 4 liters of water or sports drinks a day. My doctor was blunt: I was drinking too much and not replacing the salt I had lost in sweat. And while I didn’t &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; as if anything was wrong with me, if I didn’t change, I would be putting myself at risk of far worse than a headache.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioi00273b79d00u54cu@published"&gt;“When the sodium level starts to creep downward, people are more likely to experience more severe symptoms,” said &lt;a href="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/climateandhealth/about-us"&gt;Paul Charlton&lt;/a&gt;, an emergency medicine physician and an affiliate faculty member at the University of Colorado. A person can lose consciousness, have seizures, collapse, vomit, and fall into a coma. In extreme cases, the brain swells so much that the brain stem herniates—a rupture that is fatal. All of this can happen in the space of just a few hours. Multiple marathon runners and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/07/health/young-athletes-football-overhydration-partner"&gt;other athletes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-450341/Marathon-victim-died-drinking-MUCH-water.html"&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-aug-14-na-briefs14.1-story.html"&gt;died of overhydration&lt;/a&gt; in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="105" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioi00283b79qhgc2pza@published"&gt;While some people can be at risk of low sodium because they take certain medications or have an underlying health problem, exercise-associated hyponatremia strikes otherwise healthy people. A lot of what we know about the condition comes from studying ultrarunners and other endurance athletes, as well as the military. There’s some evidence to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9699060/"&gt;suggest that women&lt;/a&gt; may be more at risk than men, and while it’s unclear why, hyponatremia tends to be more severe in smaller individuals purely because it’s &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20199991/"&gt;easier for them to overconsume&lt;/a&gt; fluids relative to their body mass, said &lt;a href="https://hhpr.uark.edu/directory/uid/brendonm/name/Brendon+P.+McDermott/"&gt;Brendon McDermott&lt;/a&gt;, a physiologist at the University of Arkansas and a seasoned marathoner.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioi00293b79j3hzs7ob@published"&gt;It is also unclear how many people may experience hyponatremia, in part because not everyone shows symptoms, Charlton said. Interestingly, some studies suggest that certain people may just be low in sodium all the time, while others suggest that some people might not be able to access their body’s sodium stores efficiently, tending them &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16344476/"&gt;toward hyponatremia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioi002a3b798cglf65m@published"&gt;What is abundantly clear, however, is that when people stop drinking to thirst and instead compel themselves to take in fluids while exercising, their physiology can rapidly spiral out of control. (Theoretically, you could also overhydrate while sitting in your car and throwing back Stanley cups full of water, but it would be exceedingly difficult.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioj002b3b79pjtxkfqa@published"&gt;During exercise, the descent into hyponatremia can be exacerbated in particular ways, Hew-Butler said, not least by sweating out salts. But there is a hormonal aspect too: Vasopressin, an antidiuretic hormone, ramps up during exercise, and especially when it’s hot.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="50" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioj002c3b79w6yivswb@published"&gt;“Your body’s like, ‘Oh my God, I’m losing water. I’m not going to pee it out,’ ” Hew-Butler said. By suppressing the call of nature while you’re losing fluid through sweat, the body is trying to maintain that delicate water-to-salt ratio and keep everything working the way it should, she explained.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="117" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgioj002d3b79vtmuvade@published"&gt;In other words, the body starts trying to retain fluid. Importantly, subbing out water for sports drinks is not going to cut it: “It functionally makes very little difference in terms of people’s outcome,” Charlton said. He and other experts I spoke to all agreed that most sports drinks should be treated as water. (For context, most commercial sports drinks contain around 10 percent of a person’s recommended daily sodium—a 20-ounce bottle of Gatorade Thirst Quencher, for example, has 270 milligrams, or about 11 percent, while a 12-ounce bottle of Powerade contains 240 milligrams of sodium, which is 10 percent.) So if you start chugging sports drinks or water midway through a run, then you can quickly swell your cells.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="18" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiok002e3b79jl7e68zd@published"&gt;“That’s why sometimes people get in more trouble during exercise,” Hew-Butler said. “They preload and they keep loading.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiok002f3b796so943mx@published"&gt;Confoundingly, hyponatremia’s early clinical presentation—dizziness, headache, confusion—appears almost exactly the same as that of dehydration or heat exhaustion. Hyponatremia can be confirmed only by a blood test, and while medical tents at large sports events and emergency rooms have the kit to be able to quickly ascertain people’s sodium levels, your average Jane—me!—might not realize the true nature of their problem. And that can make things worse, fast.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="26" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiok002g3b797cemfdqz@published"&gt;In an increasing number of cases, Charlton said, people who don’t fit the typical mold for acute or exercise-associated hyponatremia are being diagnosed with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiok002h3b79ix827job@published"&gt;If someone is out hiking or playing in a high school football game, or even just doing some gardening in hot weather, they might be tempted to drink a lot of water even if they aren’t thirsty in a bid to avoid dehydration or merely to cool down, he said, unwittingly endangering themself in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="73" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiol002i3b79kwdqs2jn@published"&gt;Charlton recalled the case of a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39085067/"&gt;Japanese woman&lt;/a&gt; who was performing on an outdoor stage on a hot day. She collapsed and had a five-minute seizure after her act. It turned out that, worried about heat injury and following public health guidance to drink lots of water, she had drunk about 4 liters of liquid during her show. When staffers took her blood at the hospital, they learned that her sodium level was 117.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="31" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiol002j3b79akb2elia@published"&gt;“It was not clear at the beginning [that she had hyponatremia] because she did not fit their profile,” Charlton said. “She wasn’t an ultrarunner. She wasn’t engaged in regular high-stress activities.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="20" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiol002k3b79jvjtj9l7@published"&gt;She was simply trying to take care of herself. And doing that before you are thirsty can lead to trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="39" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiol002l3b79ztm4ocir@published"&gt;“You hear a lot about, like, thirst is inadequate, and if you get thirsty, it’s too late,” Hew-Butler said. “But thirst is a biological mechanism that’s been conserved for 700 million years,” she added. “It’s not defective when you exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="47" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiol002m3b79xofy7ex4@published"&gt;This resonated with me. I had always thought that if I felt thirsty during exercise, and especially in hot weather, then I was in trouble—dehydrated and at risk of heat exhaustion. I never once considered that I might not feel thirsty because I had drunk &lt;em&gt;too much&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="41" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiol002n3b79f9up9tbn@published"&gt;It’s true that dehydration and heat exhaustion are more common than hyponatremia—a survey of active military personnel in 2024 found just &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40591377/"&gt;134 cases of exertional hyponatremia&lt;/a&gt;, while there were &lt;a href="https://www.health.mil/News/Articles/2025/06/01/MSMR-Heat-Illness-2025?type=Reports"&gt;471 cases of heatstroke&lt;/a&gt; and 2,380 cases of heat exhaustion, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="46" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiol002o3b79t2oukfph@published"&gt;But McDermott, the University of Arkansas physiologist, noted that while dehydration alone is unlikely to kill you, if you develop hyponatremia and it goes unchecked, then it could rapidly be deadly in and of itself. “There should be education on hyponatremia, equal to dehydration,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiol002p3b7985wdgtq2@published"&gt;He and other experts I spoke to for this story said that people taking part in sporting events should be issued guidance on overhydration, and that public health messaging must be clearer about the specific dangers of hyponatremia. Hew-Butler suggested that events like marathons should actually limit their water and sports drink stations to discourage overconsumption.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiom002q3b79syvudr7o@published"&gt;Charlton argues that public health officials must be cognizant of hyponatremia when they make recommendations for dealing with hotter weather (something we’ll only have more and more of due to climate change). “Probably, as more people are experiencing heat with climate change, there is just going to be a different profile of person that we have to look at these issues in,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiom002r3b79btgqrgr5@published"&gt;If someone is suspected of having hyponatremia—a condition that is, again, tricky to diagnose—the first, best thing they can do is stop drinking water, Hew-Butler said. In my case, my doctor told me to drink no more than a liter of fluid—water, coffee, soda, whatever—for several days in order to bring my sodium levels back to a healthy baseline. As a person accustomed to drinking 3 or 4 liters a day, I found that cutting back was &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiom002s3b79xnc75iap@published"&gt;More acute cases require more intervention: In some instances, doctors might inject a little very salty saline into a person’s blood to try to bring up their sodium levels. If the patient is able to swallow, they might make them drink a quarter cup of water containing four dissolved bouillon cubes—which honestly sounds not bad. What about salt supplements? There is mounting evidence that &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2020/02/electrolyte-supplements-dont-prevent-illness-in-athletes.html"&gt;sodium supplements&lt;/a&gt; like salt tablets aren’t enough to prevent hyponatremia during intense exercise, although McDermott said they likely wouldn’t hurt either.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="101" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiom002t3b79mpjevhhd@published"&gt;At the same time, there is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12376390/"&gt;no single recommended amount of water&lt;/a&gt; that everyone should drink while working out, Hew-Butler said. In fact, you can calculate how much fluid you lose while exercising by weighing yourself before and after an hour of your chosen activity. The difference indicates the water weight shed through sweat. Apart from that, she and the other experts I spoke to for this piece all had the same recommendations: Drink when you’re thirsty. Stop when you’re not. Eat salt. And if you find yourself craving salt on a long run, buy a bag of pretzels or chips.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgiom002u3b798oiky8ko@published"&gt;Have I learned my lesson? Sort of. I’ve been diagnosed with hyponatremia more than once since that first instance; my doctor thinks I’m one of those people that just run a little low on sodium. But I have made changes. I make a conscious effort to notice my thirst while exercising. When I know I’m going to be sweating a lot, I also take an electrolyte mix called LMNT, which I order online; it contains almost half of my daily recommended sodium. I also feel entirely at liberty with the table salt. It’s working for me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebqgion002v3b79edeiuzbw@published"&gt;And as Hew-Butler told me, hydration is “an experiment of one.” Another way to put it: We live in a world full of giant water bottles. We fetishize an easy health fix. But, particularly if you’re an athlete, listen to your own thirst cues and just say no to big &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;hydration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In the United States alone, an estimated 178 million people are missing at least one tooth, which explains why dentures and titanium implants replacements are so common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dentistry is now aiming for something better, a living replacement that feels and functions like the original. The idea is not science fiction anymore, and it is moving from animal studies toward carefully designed human trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dental.tufts.edu/people/faculty/pamela-yelick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Pamela C. Yelick&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://dental.tufts.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tufts University&lt;/a&gt; School of Dental Medicine leads one of the teams moving this vision toward the clinic. A recent study from her and colleague &lt;a href="https://dental.tufts.edu/people/faculty/weibo-zhang" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Weibo Zhang&lt;/a&gt; have pushed the conversation onto the main stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dentures-as-tooth-replacements"&gt;Dentures as tooth replacements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tooth loss is not rare, and the burden rises with age worldwide. About 7 percent of people 20 or older have complete tooth loss, and that figure reaches 23 percent for those 60 or older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern implants are anchored directly to the jaw through osseointegration, a concept that traces back to Per Ingvar Brånemark’s mid twentieth century work with titanium and bone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The history matters because it explains why implants are stable, and also why they do not feel like natural teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural teeth are suspended in the socket by the periodontal ligament, which provides sensation and micro movement control that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-successfully-grow-human-teeth-in-a-laboratory-for-the-first-time/"&gt;implants&lt;/a&gt; lack. That difference shows up as reduced tactile sensitivity with implants compared with natural teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Load also travels differently through an implant than through a tooth root cushioned by ligament fibers. Over time, that can contribute to bone loss around the fixture and biological complications that sometimes lead to failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-two-routes-to-living-teeth"&gt;Two routes to living teeth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One route grows a replacement as a tissue, using a scaffold that guides cells to assemble into a tooth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent large animal &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39729491/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers used decellularized tooth bud scaffolds seeded with human dental pulp cells, porcine dental epithelial cells, and endothelial cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then implanted these constructs into adult minipig jaws where they formed tooth like tissues including periodontal ligament. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other route tries to spark tooth development in place by presenting the right developmental signals to adult cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40120109/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Teams&lt;/a&gt; mapping the choreography of early human tooth formation are building a playbook that identifies the epithelial and mesenchymal cues needed to kick off organized growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tooth-roots-and-ligaments"&gt;Tooth roots and ligaments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scaffold approach matters because the emerging structures were not inert. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They developed &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dental-pulp-stem-cells-from-extracted-wisdom-teeth-can-treat-multiple-diseases/"&gt;tooth&lt;/a&gt; supporting ligament and mineralized tissues in the socket and progressed over a period of months, which brings the approach closer to human scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even creating a tooth root that you could put an artificial crown on, with living dental pulp in the middle, secured by periodontal ligaments instead of being screwed into the jaw, could be a huge improvement to a person’s oral health and in turn, systemic health,” said Yelick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-protein-helps-tooth-replacement"&gt;Protein helps tooth replacement&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate line of work targets a specific protein, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7880588/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;USAG-1&lt;/a&gt;, that suppresses tooth formation. Blocking USAG-1 in mice rescued missing teeth caused by different genetic problems, and the same strategy produced new incisors in ferrets, which share a human-like replacement pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, a single administration was enough to generate a whole tooth,” stated &lt;a href="https://toregem.co.jp/en/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Katsu Takahashi&lt;/a&gt;, whose group &lt;a href="https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/research-news/2021-03-31" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; the antibody treatment while at &lt;a href="https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kyoto University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A humanized anti USAG-1 antibody has been advanced by industry collaborators, with investigators reporting that a phase 1 protocol has been finalized and preparations for future studies are underway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That marks the shift from animal proof of concept to testing for safety, dosing, and early signals of activity in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financing updates from partners indicate plans to run the first in human study and to prepare for subsequent pediatric trials if early results support it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial clinical focus is congenital tooth agenesis in young children, where a therapy that triggers tooth development could change lifelong care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-would-count-as-success"&gt;What would count as success&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A living &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tooth-enamel-analysis-suggests-early-eurasians-were-multiple-species-paranthropus-robustus/"&gt;tooth&lt;/a&gt; would restore ligament mediated sensation, which helps people modulate bite force and detect grit or high spots. It would also reconnect to bone through tissues that are built to bear chewing loads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those features could reduce pain and bone loss around a replacement compared with a rigid post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They could also lengthen functional life compared with today’s devices, which often need repair or replacement after years of wear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-about-cost-and-complexity"&gt;What about cost and complexity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cell based therapies will only reach clinics if they can be produced reliably and priced within reach of today’s prosthetic options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sourcing compatible epithelial cells at the right developmental stage is a known challenge, and that is why teams built their scaffolds around young pig tooth buds while they refine ways to recruit a patient’s own cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work with induced pluripotent stem cells (&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9065891/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;iPSC&lt;/a&gt;s) is also moving forward, including efforts to make enamel forming cells and repair enamel defects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As methods improve, the main questions will be safety, quality control, and whether costs can compete with implant dentistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tooth-replacement-and-future-tech"&gt;Tooth replacement and future tech&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An atlas of human fetal tooth development now details epithelial subpopulations and their signaling to mesenchyme. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That resource gives researchers the specific factors and timing likely needed to nudge adult cells toward making a new tooth unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If those cues can be delivered precisely, either by a staged therapy in the jaw or by organoid-like constructs that finish maturing in the socket, dentists could one day replace a lost tooth with a living one that integrates, remodels, and feels like it belongs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/stcltm/article/14/2/szae076/7933795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stem Cells Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;

in recent months, with social media users on both X and &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/reddit/index.html" id="mol-e2ab6080-7a06-11f0-9ec5-0f5451ed7906" class=""&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; trying to figure out what's wrong with the rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The reports date back to 2023, when residents in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/maine/index.html" id="mol-e2af7f30-7a06-11f0-9ec5-0f5451ed7906" class=""&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt; captured images of common gray squirrels covered in tumors while visiting their backyards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Witnesses have photographed these hairless growths oozing pus covering most of the animals' bodies, from their heads and eyes to their legs, feet, and genitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some on social media have suspected that the animals are carrying squirrel pox, a rare virus in the US that mainly affects red squirrels, others have pointed out that the illness is more likely to be squirrel fibromatosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This condition is caused by a different virus, resulting in wart-like growths that may ooze fluid but usually heal on their own, and is more common in US gray squirrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In either case, wildlife experts believe homeowners who put bird feeders in their yards may be unintentionally causing the virus to spread to more squirrels throughout North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shevenell Webb from the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife said: 'It's like when you get a large concentration of people. If someone is sick and it's something that spreads easily, others are going to catch it.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In November 2024, a Reddit user in the US posted an image of a squirrel covered in tumors consistent with squirrel fibromatosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Squirrel fibromatosis is caused by a virus that cannot be transmitted to people or other animals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Squirrel fibromatosis may look terrifying, but it's a common skin disease among gray squirrels in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's caused by the leporipoxvirus and is spread through direct contact between healthy squirrels and the lesions or saliva of infected squirrels, similar to herpes transmission in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease causes hairless growths or tumors, which can break open and leak clear fluid just like an open wound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although the virus cannot spread to humans or other animals such as dogs or birds, Webb said people should not touch or attempt to help infected squirrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I would not recommend trying to capture a squirrel that has the virus,' Webb told the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.bangordailynews.com/2025/05/15/homestead/squirrel-pox-maine-joam40zk0w/"&gt;Bangor Daily News&lt;/a&gt;. 'It is naturally occurring and will run its course in time.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To Webb's point, while the growths can look alarming, they typically heal without the need for medication and are rarely fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, some severe cases of squirrel fibromatosis may affect the animal's internal organs and lead to death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While sightings of infected squirrels date back to the summer of 2023, the most recent cases were posted online less than a month ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Residents in Canada have also captured images of infected squirrels who were covered in hairless tumors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The cases are not believed to be squirrel pox, which generally infects red squirrels and is more common in the UK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At first I thought it was eating something from my front beds, but then I realized it was on its face,' one Reddit user posted on July 31 after spotting a gray squirrel with a large tumor on its mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wildlife officials noted that sightings tend to rise during the summer when more animals are out gathering food, especially from homes that put out bird feeders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Like a lot of people, I love watching birds,' Webb said. 'Unfortunately, you can attract multiple [squirrels] to that feeder and risk exposure if one has the virus.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The expert explained that squirrels with fibromatosis can leave their saliva on uneaten bird seed at these feeders, which healthy animals can then ingest and contract the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To this point, wildlife experts have not confirmed whether the new sightings are cases of fibromatosis or squirrel pox (SQPV), but there's less of a chance that squirrel pox is spreading through the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;SQPV is a systemic condition that often results in death among red squirrels, who are more vulnerable to the virus. Moreover, SQPV is more common in the UK, as there are more red squirrels in that country compared to the US and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Fibromatosis tumors typically heal on their own within 2 months and do not return among gray squirrels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A similar condition affecting rabbits in the Midwest has prompted many on social media to ask if it would be humane to euthanize animals spotted with these tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just like the rabbits infected with cottontail papilloma virus, causing tentacle-like tumors on their heads, wildlife officials have said that people should leave squirrels with fibromatosis alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A squirrel's immune system can clear the virus within four to eight weeks, although it may take longer for larger or secondary infections to heal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition does not typically come back once a squirrel contracts fibromatosis, and gray squirrels generally recover fully, meaning the horrifying growths won't be visible by the time people see that same animal next year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 13:31:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxOclNQbXI1ZHBObUxkc1NVTFBtSkZQSjJMMHQ2OVJLY2RBQ2hfRE00NDBQblFUMGJmbmw5WFR1azlLRXlINnppQmpxQkdpT3ZwWDhKM1Azc2cyX1hiTEc3Z21xYXdYbzhLYlNET2RoaG5PXzMzTk5BZ3poRnVNeUQ0R2NTODVxSTBERkZ1cktONzV5ZzNoX29UN3BKN25Mek5vejNfZ2NB0gGrAUFVX3lxTE5QZ0ZHTW5GWVpsVVF2QkNrWllnd0wxdi02dmVRcW5uMXFXWTBFTmdwMnhfdlZVc3pKNzgwTzluQ3A4c0N2eERmaVVUcjFaZTJlRV9uWnpJalhheTlEMTQxTENra3BfMFFqSlM0R0NOZzI1Y012RlhtcDQxYnBzUVNPY0ptNzB2MDZ1dWRlS0RqRFVTOHQ4UFN0NXlTY1hkZEt3ZTBfTDhqbzBoMA</guid></item><item><title>拉斯维加斯日益严重的蚊子问题是“定时炸弹” - NBC新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxQY1ltWVQzYWU1MFREb3I3ZTRqZ3BzdVlFWS1Qb0hhU0lpZW9oQm5xRUZGcjgzQ1JNVTZSRzlmRXZDV0hfZWtmM2NZNlJ0akU1TlJmNlNHcnREdXk3WEczZ0dFQjNyc3gzMjBDRkZhUWYxNkRzV0YwM2l5N2QtQW5GZ05ZTHV0ck1FTmp6UE5oOFBzeVdqNlg40gFWQVVfeXFMTlVCN0FOVlBVcV9kNnFkdHh6UGVoMC1tOU1ZLU5RZ3RYdGp1ZElETU1WeW5haFRkaDR4cmdhNUxIWnJRRGprTFo1RjhjNjJSV2pYVVpra1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f5ad3b" class="body-graf"&gt;LAS VEGAS — If at one time it was thought mosquitoes couldn’t survive in desert climates, this city is a case study in how wrong that is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fac0c8" class="body-graf"&gt;Mosquitoes typically prefer more tropical, humid conditions, but these biting machines have &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/las-vegas-mosquitoes-carrying-west-nile-virus-record-rcna157818" target="_blank"&gt;exploded in number throughout the Las Vegas Valley&lt;/a&gt; in recent years because of a host of changes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8f96d3" class="body-graf"&gt;A mix of urban development, climate change,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;insecticide resistance and genetic adaptations are creating a more hospitable environment for the insects in southern Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e3bb04" class="body-graf"&gt;Las Vegas is hardly alone in its battle against the pesky insects. Warmer temperatures and shifting weather patterns are expanding the geographic range in which mosquitoes live and breed. In many ways, what’s happening here is playing out across the desert Southwest, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e45a8e" class="body-graf"&gt;The mosquitoes have brought with them not only the nuisance of bug bites, but also the major threat of mosquito-borne diseases such as &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cdc-warns-increased-dengue-fever-risk-us-rcna158851" target="_blank"&gt;dengue fever&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/mosquito-viruses-are-spreading-know-west-nile-eee-rcna168653" target="_blank"&gt;West Nile virus&lt;/a&gt; to Las Vegas and the rest of Clark County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b7e8be" class="body-graf"&gt;It's also caught people off guard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b2f244" class="body-graf"&gt;“People aren’t wrong that mosquitoes shouldn’t really thrive in desert conditions, but it’s clear that the particular set of species that we do have in Clark County has adapted to the local ecology,” said Louisa Messenger, an assistant professor in the department of environmental and global health at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-31b6ef" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'A ticking time bomb'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c60c42" class="body-graf"&gt;The species that have taken hold in Clark County include Culex mosquitoes, which can carry West Nile virus, and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary spreaders of dengue. What’s more, Messenger and her colleagues at UNLV have found that mosquitoes in Las Vegas are &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/mosquitoes-carry-west-nile-are-becoming-resistant-insecticides-cdc-say-rcna96867" target="_blank"&gt;becoming resistant to insecticides&lt;/a&gt;, a major public health risk in a city built on tourism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8ad6d4" class="body-graf"&gt;“It is a little bit of a ticking time bomb,” Messenger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f8afc4" class="body-graf"&gt;She has for some time been concerned about how vulnerable Las Vegas is to mosquito-borne diseases. In particular, dengue has been surging in North America and South America, with more than 13 million cases recorded across the continents in 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/outbreaks/2024/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-57f600" class="body-graf"&gt;“In Vegas, we have more than 48 million visitors coming through our doors every year from all over the planet,” Messenger said. “It just takes a couple of mosquito bites to start local transmission.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0bc9b6" class="body-graf"&gt;Last year, there were 26 reported cases of West Nile virus in humans in Las Vegas, &lt;a href="https://media.southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/download/mosquito-control/weekly-updates/2025/20250811-arbo-report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Southern Nevada Health District&lt;/a&gt;, trailing the city’s largest outbreak of 43 cases in 2019. Yet, in 2024, scientists still found a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/las-vegas-mosquitoes-carrying-west-nile-virus-record-rcna157818" target="_blank"&gt;record number of mosquitoes that tested positive for the virus&lt;/a&gt; in and around the city, which suggests the risk of exposure was very concerning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e4f998" class="body-graf"&gt;This year, the public health department hasn’t identified any human cases so far, even as mosquitoes have tested positive for the virus in certain ZIP codes. Messenger said it’s not well understood what specific factors fuel outbreaks in some years and not in others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2a334a" class="body-graf"&gt;“We see these overlapping factors but they are quite difficult to tease it apart,” she said. “All we can say for certain is that we have these bumper years and these zero years, and they are hard to predict.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7263f4" class="body-graf"&gt;The Southern Nevada Health District has been &lt;a href="https://www.southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/programs/mosquito-surveillance/" target="_blank"&gt;conducting mosquito surveillance in the region&lt;/a&gt; since 2004. Its meticulous records show which mosquito species are present across the Las Vegas Valley year after year and where these flying insects have tested positive for diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4d41c2" class="body-graf"&gt;One of the most astonishing trends in the data was the explosive growth of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which were first identified in Las Vegas in 2017, said Vivek Raman, environmental health supervisor for the Southern Nevada Health District.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-31df0d" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 'relentless biters' are spreading &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7c3dbf" class="body-graf"&gt;“In 2017, this mosquito was found in just a few ZIP codes,” said Raman, who oversees the health district’s mosquito surveillance program. “A few years later, it was six ZIP codes. Then 12 ZIP codes, then maybe 20, and now it’s in 48 different ZIP codes across the valley.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fcbb13" class="body-graf"&gt;In addition to being able to spread dengue, these insects are a major nuisance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cbcecd" class="body-graf"&gt;“Aedes aegypti are very aggressive daytime-biting mosquitoes,” Raman said. “They are just relentless biters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a88839" class="body-graf"&gt;Unlike Culex mosquitoes, which prefer breeding near larger sources of water such as untended swimming pools, culverts or  detention basins, Aedes aegypti tend to breed in much shallower standing water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ad2c51" class="body-graf"&gt;“One of the reasons they are spreading so quickly is the mosquito can lay its eggs in small containers, like if rain fills a child’s toy or tires or a wheelbarrow,” Raman said. “All it takes is a couple inches of water.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-838f64" class="body-graf"&gt;Urban development in Las Vegas has also inadvertently spurred the spread of mosquitoes in the city. Golf courses, human-made lakes and other forms of artificial irrigation have all made this outpost in the Nevada desert a welcome home for mosquitoes, according to Messenger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-11040e" class="body-graf"&gt;Climate change is likely also a factor, and it’s an active area of research for Messenger and other scientists. Warmer temperatures are &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/dengue-fever-climate-change-mosquitos-tropical-disease-rcna149366" target="_blank"&gt;expanding the range of geographies for  mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt; around the world. A warmer atmosphere can also hold more moisture, which increases humidity and rain, both mosquito-friendly conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-869c2b" class="body-graf"&gt;In Las Vegas, how the interplay between local environmental factors and changing climate trends is affecting mosquito populations is less well understood, but the implications are paramount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6e59d1" class="body-graf"&gt;“Las Vegas is kind of a case study for what climate change is going to look like in other parts of the world,” Messenger said. “We’re seeing record-breaking temperatures, we’re becoming much more arid, precipitation is becoming much more aberrant and unpredictable. That’s what large parts of the world are going to look like over the next 15 to 25 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b562f1" class="body-graf"&gt;What that means for mosquitoes in the city remains to be seen, but the problem so far shows no sign of slowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1370f2" class="body-graf"&gt;The Southern Nevada Health District conducts public outreach on  how to identify and protect against mosquito breeding sites in and around homes, and how to prevent mosquito bites. But, controlling the number of mosquitoes in the city — and thus controlling the public health risk — will require a coordinated effort from the local government, Messenger said. Currently, there isn’t one in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3a6c88" class="body-graf"&gt;“You’ve got private pest companies that people can call for severe infestations, you have some work going on around wetlands, but what we don’t have, which many other jurisdictions have, is a centralized, coordinated abatement,” Messenger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-313aa3" class="body-graf"&gt;That lack of coordination has resulted in mosquito populations building up resistance to insecticides, she added. A centralized effort could assess which chemicals are safe to use — particularly around humans — and monitor the performance of insecticides and pesticides to prevent mosquitoes from building up immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d4e04f" class="body-graf"&gt;In the years ahead, Messenger said, prevention and control will be key to protecting the residents of Las Vegas and its many visitors from around the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c2506f" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“The bottom line is that this is entirely preventable,” she said. “Nobody in southern Nevada, in Clark County, should be getting bit by mosquitoes and contracting any kind of virus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 13:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxQY1ltWVQzYWU1MFREb3I3ZTRqZ3BzdVlFWS1Qb0hhU0lpZW9oQm5xRUZGcjgzQ1JNVTZSRzlmRXZDV0hfZWtmM2NZNlJ0akU1TlJmNlNHcnREdXk3WEczZ0dFQjNyc3gzMjBDRkZhUWYxNkRzV0YwM2l5N2QtQW5GZ05ZTHV0ck1FTmp6UE5oOFBzeVdqNlg40gFWQVVfeXFMTlVCN0FOVlBVcV9kNnFkdHh6UGVoMC1tOU1ZLU5RZ3RYdGp1ZElETU1WeW5haFRkaDR4cmdhNUxIWnJRRGprTFo1RjhjNjJSV2pYVVpra1E</guid></item><item><title>哈佛大学训练有素的营养学家建议在验血前停止服用这种维生素补充剂；原因如下-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While social media can be a global stage for a lot of unexpected nuisances, it also provides a platform for information sharing between professionals and people about topics that need more attention than they are getting at the moment. One such issue is a lack of knowledge about a vitamin supplement that can interfere with blood tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, in a video going viral on the internet Dr. Amy Shah, an MD &amp;amp; Nutrition Expert, trained at Cornell, Harvard, Einstein and Columbia shared the name of a vitamin that can hamper blood tests. Her video has received about 2K likes and 84 comments, with more and more people appreciating her putting the information out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don’t know why we don’t talk about this enough. It’s really a nuisance at best and dangerous at worse. I don’t think most people know this and it’s such a common supplement/ingredient in supplements," wrote Shah in the caption of the video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is such a PSA especially for all of my girlfriends because you know what? Everyone that I know is taking a hair, skin and nail supplement and a lot of them, most of them have high doses of biotin and you have to know that biotin interferes with blood testing for heart attacks like with troponin levels, with thyroid testing, with reproductive hormone testing, with parathyroid testing," said the doctor in the video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So, imagine this, you're having chest pain, you go to the ER and they're like oh my god, you're having a heart attack because your troponin levels are elevated. But you failed to tell them that you've been taking high dose of biotin and that is the reason why the troponin was high," she explained further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So not only are we confused, we get excess blood testing, we might not diagnose it correctly. That's why I want you to know that if you are taking these things, definitely stop them before you get your blood testing about 72 hours, and if you end up in the hospital for whatever reason, let them know that you've been taking biotin."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is this true?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

According to a study published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5951654/#:~:text=The%20problem%20is%20that%20many,to%20unnecessary%20procedures%20and%20treatments." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, many common blood tests employ a biotin-streptavidin reaction as a part of the test procedure. While the amount of dietary biotin intake is not expected to affect these tests, biotin supplementation at doses greater than 1 mg per day can cause either falsely low or falsely high test results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is particularly dangerous for patients in emergency situations who are not aware that they are taking high doses of biotin or when the physician doesn't know that the patient is doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Biotin-HealthProfessional/#:~:text=Interactions%20with%20Laboratory%20Tests,-Very%20high%20intakes&amp;amp;text=Even%20a%20single%2010%20mg,of%20the%20patient%20%5B32%5D." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, even a single 10 mg dose of biotin has interfered with thyroid function tests administered within 24 hours of taking the supplement. Additionally, according to the FDA a patient with a high intake of supplemental biotin died following a troponin test that gave a falsely low result because the test was subject to biotin interference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, as Dr Shah advised if you are taking biotin supplements it is better to avoid them before blood tests and inform your physician about them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 13:12:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>登革热病例再次上升：如何保持安全-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi4gFBVV95cUxORV9NclVDNDNDT0U5VE9JRWo5Undldi14ekd0bElLNWdhZ1VmNl9KZWJZSDlpWTRMOVN4S055a2tsX3F1bU5tNXB4ZWxYTF9kNXZKWDNOWlVORmI2cmU2SkFxYzhGQTlHTlA5dlhGYTl2Z1ZmR2Q0cmk2Slhpa3BzRkNORGFpR0hZSXBaZlkwS2ZKQk9heEo3dm1IZFAyTGpJUXlGU2NhN3h5RWx1SVRwdWJfTFhOaWg0ZUpjdS0zSEh4WG13ZlZrdmhfMDh0WVFfMGg3U2lRR2d2dHgxaEMyTjZ3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intolerable summer heat and sudden notification ‘80% chances of rain today’ - sounds more like a relief, right? But love for the monsoon isn’t just human-only-mosquitoes feel the same too. The Aedes aegypti mosquito, which carries the dengue virus, mostly breeds in stagnant water. From water collected in old tyres and flower pots to puddles that one hates, these tiny breeding spots can turn into the reason for extreme loss, even death. Throughout the monsoon season, humidity remains high which is favourite for mosquitoes to breed, particularly in the range of 80% or higher. This simply allows them to retain moisture and survive longer. On the other hand, because of the limited sunlight, which may feel like a relief after spending a scorching summer in India, evaporation of stagnant water slows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;When to know ‘You are not safe anymore’:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sudden high fever:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If one starts developing high fever, sometimes reaching up to 104°F, then there is a need for proper medical consultation.

Sudden ache in any body part is a red flag itself and demands immediate attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling nauseous and vomiting are common during dengue infection, contributing to discomfort and dehydration risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Dengue: Early signs and preventive measures to stay safe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a report published by the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/index.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, about 1 in 20 people who get sick with dengue will develop severe dengue. Severe dengue can result in shock, internal bleeding, and death. So, instead of doing experiments at home, if these symptoms continue beyond 2–3 days, it is crucial to seek immediate medical testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

But is it enough to not let water get clogged or always stay inside the net? The question that comes more often is: How to make the body ready to fight these diseases?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin C-rich foods like oranges, kiwi, and guava help because Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that boosts the immune system by supporting various cellular functions, making you less prone to infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11196968/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Library of Medicine study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, papaya leaf extract is not a cure-all, but studies show it may help maintain platelet counts, especially in dengue, by stimulating blood cell production and reducing platelet loss. So, while it is no magic potion, it’s a smart natural aid to have on your side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying hydrated with coconut water, herbal teas, and fresh juices is essential because liquids help flush out toxins and keep body cells functioning optimally, giving the immune system the best chance to fight invaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional favorites like turmeric milk and giloy juice have bioactive compounds shown to have anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting effects, making them worthy old-school heroes worth sipping for that extra defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

					&lt;p&gt;After the death of two children from measles in less than a week, Prof. Eyal Leshem, director of the travel medicine and tropical diseases center at Sheba Medical Center, told The Times of Israel that he was calling upon “every community leader who knows the children in their community are unprotected and are at risk of contracting a deadly disease that is vaccine preventable to act now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the measles outbreak began in Israel about three months ago, 526 cases have been diagnosed, of which 209 are active cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the recently diagnosed patients are from the Jerusalem and Beit Shemesh area, which have large ultra-Orthodox communities, with most of the hospitalized patients being unvaccinated children.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p id="gpt-passback"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;As of Sunday, 19 children are still hospitalized, all under the age of 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the children are in intensive care, and one is connected to a life-support system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="timesofisrael" data-from="After 2 deaths, infectious disease doctor urges community leaders to back measles vaccines"&gt;

	&lt;p class="newsletter-error newsletter-article-error"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
		
&lt;p&gt;“We know in public health that the most effective interventions are done in close collaboration with community leaders,” Leshem said. “We hope that the Health Ministry is able to effectively collaborate with the community leaders of the affected communities to save children who are not vaccinated and at risk of death to protect their children.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;div id="attachment_3621991" class="wp-caption  alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/08/f313ab02-5bbf-4f3d-a07f-46ec8ef20d24.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3621991" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/08/f313ab02-5bbf-4f3d-a07f-46ec8ef20d24-640x400.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A contagious but preventable disease&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious viral disease characterized by fever, malaise, runny nose, and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius), according to the US Centers for Disease Control.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;Most children will recover from measles, but infection can lead to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The routine vaccination schedule recommended by Israel’s Health Ministry  includes two doses: at the age of one and in first grade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, due to the outbreak, the ministry has expedited the administration of the second dose in high-incidence areas.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;div id="attachment_2167824" class="wp-caption  alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2019/10/measles.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-2167824" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2019/10/measles-640x400.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The measles virus. (Cynthia Goldsmith, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention via AP)&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, in order to protect infants in Jerusalem, Beit Shemesh, and Bnei Brak, it is now recommended to give an additional dose to infants aged six months to one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three communities have a large number of ultra-Orthodox residents. In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/500-british-kids-get-emergency-vaccinations-after-measles-spreads-from-israel/"&gt;a measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; centered on ultra-Orthodox communities, where immunization rates are generally lower than the rest of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In communities with a vaccination rate of above 95 percent, measles have a harder time spreading because of what is called “herd immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;But in Jerusalem, Leshem explained, only 80% of children aged one are vaccinated. In Beit Shemesh, it’s just 78%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some Israeli communities have vaccine coverage rates similar to what we see in Africa,” Leshem said. “So in Israel, in 2025, the fact that there are kids who are dying from a disease that is vaccine preventable is shocking and appalling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Outbreaks of measles in Israel, and around the world&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While measles cases is Israel are rare, the disease has not been considered eliminated in the country, and there have been multiple recorded deaths related to the virus in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An 18-month-old girl died of measles in Jerusalem in 2018 during a spike in cases. The toddler, who had not been vaccinated, was Israel’s first recorded measles fatality in 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, the United States had more than double the number of measles cases it saw in all of 2024, according to &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/as-measles-outbreak-grows-us-has-800-cases-and-outbreaks-in-several-states/"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, measles cases and outbreaks continue to occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a decrease in global measles incidence during the COVID-19 pandemic, measles activity globally continues to rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-measles-vaccination/data-research/global-measles-outbreaks/index.html"&gt;outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; around the world, including Russia, Romania and Canada, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;For women with hair loss, there are more treatment options than ever before — and more ways to access them, as anyone scrolling social media has likely seen firsthand. But it can be confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For women with hair loss, there are more treatment options than ever before, and more ways to access them, as anyone scrolling social media is likely to find out. But all those choices can be confusing. NPR pharmaceuticals correspondent Sydney Lupkin reports on how best to navigate the world of hair-loss remedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY LUPKIN, BYLINE: When Allison Richards (ph) was little, she had long, straight blond hair, and a lot of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALLISON RICHARDS: That was the beauty feature that people commented on. They're like, oh, your hair is so pretty. It's so long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUPKIN: It started thinning in her 20s and then got really bad during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RICHARDS: There was one day, in the shower, where just I had hundreds of strands of hair. Like, fistfuls of hair coming out. It was a very scary experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUPKIN: To understand hair loss, it's important to understand hair growth, says Dr. Carolyn Goh, a clinical professor of dermatology at UCLA Health. Each hair on your head goes through cycles of growth, transition and rest. The rest phase is called telogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAROLYN GOH: So it's at the end of that telogen phase is when your hair actually sheds. And when the hair's shedding, it's actually because there's a new hair growing and pushing it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUPKIN: And each strand of hair does this at different times. Sometimes, however, stress, like having a baby or even COVID, can cause the hair cycles to sync up, causing a bigger shed. But it's temporary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOH: Mostly it's time will tell, and that's really difficult to deal with. You know, you see all this hair coming out. It is this huge change, and it seems like the world is ending. But in fact, most of the time is fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUPKIN: She says about half of all women will experience hair loss in their lifetime, and sometimes it doesn't resolve on its own. Goh says patients have come to her with all kinds of solutions they've seen on social media, from onion juice to rosemary oil. Goh says there is one randomized controlled study of a hundred people showing rosemary oil could work, but there's also a lot of misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOH: I think somebody asked me about cucumber today, and I said, you know, I think if that worked, cucumbers would probably be $50 a pop for hair loss, you know? Someone would've figured, you know, a way to monetize it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUPKIN: When it comes to prescription drugs, it's important to get a formal diagnosis because different kinds of hair loss respond to different treatments. But some people say their doctors can be dismissive or it can be hard to get an appointment. So telehealth companies are stepping in. Dr. Jessica Shepherd, chief medical officer of Hers, says the company takes women's hair loss seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JESSICA SHEPHERD: We are going to be there when you're scrolling your phone, on commercials. That's really how we are exposed or how we introduce ourselves to our community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUPKIN: But Thea Chassin, the founder and CEO of the nonprofit Bald Girls Do Lunch, says telehealth isn't always the answer. She has alopecia areata - an autoimmune kind of hair loss - and says a telehealth visit alone wouldn't have gotten her diagnosis right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THEA CHASSIN: They don't know because even with alopecia areata, there are look-alike conditions that are completely different. For example, you could have a fungal condition, and that's treatable, but you don't want to wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUPKIN: New drugs to treat alopecia areata were approved in just the last few years. They're called JAK inhibitors. As for Allison Richards, who first noticed hair loss in the shower, she considers herself lucky. She was able to get to a dermatologist in person, who took her seriously. Now she takes oral minoxidil - the same compound in Rogaine but in a pill - and spironolactone. Both are being prescribed off-label, meaning they weren't approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat hair loss. But they're working for her, and her doctor monitors her for side effects. Richards mostly wants other women like her to know they're not alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RICHARDS: There's always going to be somebody to hold your hand, cheer you on. And if you ever feel like your beauty is compromised, beauty gets redefined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUPKIN: Sydney Lupkin, NPR News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(SOUNDBITE OF VALANTE'S "RISSA")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Natural selection meant that using these new medicines gave an advantage to the microbes that could survive the assault – and a treatment that worked today could become ineffective tomorrow. A British doctor put the challenge in military terms: “We may run clean out of effective ammunition. Then how the bacteria and moulds will lord it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;More than 70 years later, that concern looks prescient. The UN has called antibiotic resistance “one of the most urgent global health threats”. Researchers estimate that resistance already kills &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01867-1/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more than a million people a year&lt;/a&gt;, with that number forecast to grow. And new antibiotics are not being discovered fast enough; many that are essential today were discovered more than 60 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"books","tags":[{"id":"books/series/big-idea","type":"Series","title":"The big idea"},{"id":"society/antibiotics","type":"Keyword","title":"Antibiotics"},{"id":"books/books","type":"Keyword","title":"Books"},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"Keyword","title":"Culture"},{"id":"education/medicine","type":"Keyword","title":"Medicine"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"science/science","type":"Keyword","title":"Science"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"environment/environment","type":"Keyword","title":"Environment"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/saturday","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"Saturday"},{"id":"theguardian/saturday/culture","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"Culture"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/saturday-magazine-books","type":"Tracking","title":"Saturday Magazine books"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/saturday-magazine","type":"Tracking","title":"Saturday Magazine"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"books/2025/aug/17/why-antibiotics-are-like-fossil-fuels","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The thing to remember is that antibiotics are quite unlike other medicines. Most drugs work by manipulating human biology: paracetamol relieves your headache by dampening the chemical signals of pain; caffeine blocks adenosine receptors and as a result prevents drowsiness taking hold. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/antibiotics" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, target bacteria. And, because bacteria spread between people, the challenge of resistance is social: it’s as if every time you took a painkiller for your headache, you increased the chance that somebody else might have to undergo an operation without anaesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That makes resistance more than simply a technological problem. But like that British doctor in 1954, we still often talk as if it is: we need to invent new “weapons” to better defend ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;What this framing overlooks is that the extraordinary power of antibiotics is not due to human ingenuity. In fact, the majority of them derive from substances originally made by bacteria and fungi, evolved millions of years ago in a process of microbial competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This is where I can’t help thinking about another natural resource that helped create the modern world but has also been dangerously overused: fossil fuels. Just as Earth’s geological forces turned dead plants from the Carboniferous era into layers of coal and oil that we could burn for energy, so evolution created molecules that scientists in the 20th century were able to recruit to keep us alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Both have offered an illusory promise of cheap, miraculous and never-ending power over nature – a promise that is now coming to an end. If we thought of antibiotics as the “fossil fuels” of modern medicine, might that change how we use them? And could it help us think of ways to make the fight against life-threatening infections more sustainable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The antibiotic era is less than a century old. Alexander Fleming first noticed the activity of a strange mould against bacteria in 1928, but it wasn’t until the late 1930s that the active ingredient – penicillin – was isolated. A daily dose was just 60mg, about the same as a pinch of salt. For several years it was so scarce it was worth more than gold. But after production was scaled up during the second world war, it ended up costing less than the bottle it came in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-19m4xhf"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;It’s hard to imagine a more perfect anti-capitalist commodity than a product whose value depletes every time you use it&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This abundance did more than tackle infectious diseases. Just as the energy from fossil fuels transformed society, antibiotics allowed the entire edifice of modern medicine to be built. Consider surgery: cutting people open and breaking the protective barrier of the skin gives bacteria the chance to swarm into the body’s internal tissues. Before antibiotics, even the simplest procedures frequently resulted in fatal blood poisoning. After them, so much more became possible: heart surgery, intestinal surgery, transplantation. Then there’s cancer: chemotherapy suppresses the immune system, making bacterial infections one of the most widespread complications of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The effects of antibiotics have rippled out even further: they made factory farming possible, both by reducing disease among animals kept in close quarters, and by increasing their weight through complex effects on metabolism. They’re one of the reasons for the huge increase in meat consumption since the 1950s, with all its concomitant welfare and environmental effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Despite the crisis of resistance, antibiotics remain cheap compared with other medicines. Partly – as with fossil fuels – this is because the negative consequences of their use (so-called externalities) are not priced in. And like coal, oil and gas, antibiotics lead to pollution. One &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/4/4/pgaf096/8113371?login=false" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; estimated that 31% of the 40 most used antibiotics worldwide enter rivers. Once they’re out there, they increase levels of resistance in environmental bacteria: one study of soil from the Netherlands showed that the incidence of some antibiotic-resistant genes had &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es901221x" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;increased by more than 15 times&lt;/a&gt; since the 1970s. Another source of pollution is manufacturing, particularly in countries such as India. In Hyderabad, where factories produce huge amounts of antibiotics for the global market, scientists have found that the wastewater contains levels of some antibiotics that are a million times higher than elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Like the climate crisis, antibiotic resistance has laid global inequalities bare. Some high-income countries have taken steps to decrease antibiotic use, but only after benefiting from their abundance in the past. That makes it hard for them to take a moral stand against their use in other places, a dilemma that mirrors the situation faced by post-industrial nations urging developing nations to forgo the economic benefits of cheap energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This may be where the similarities end. While we look forward to the day when fossil fuels are phased out completely, that’s clearly not the case with antibiotics, which are always going to be part of medicine’s “energy mix”. After all, most deaths from bacterial disease worldwide are due to lack of access to antibiotics, not resistance. What we are going to need to do is make our approach to development and use much more sustainable. Currently, many pharmaceutical companies have abandoned the search for new antibiotics: it’s hard to imagine a more perfect anti-capitalist commodity than a product whose value depletes every time you use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That means we need alternative models. One proposal is for governments to fund an international institute that develops publicly owned antibiotics, rather than relying on the private sector; another is to incentivise development with generously funded prizes for antibiotic discovery. And to address the issue of overuse, economists have suggested that health authorities could run “subscription” models that remove the incentive to sell lots of antibiotics. In one pilot scheme in England, two companies are &lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/antimicrobial-products-subscription-model-guidance-on-commercial-arrangements/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;being paid a set amount&lt;/a&gt; per year by the NHS, regardless of how much of their product is actually used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Finally, we have to remember that antibiotics aren’t the only game in town. Supporting other, “renewable” approaches means we get to use the ones we do have for longer. Vaccines are vital to disease prevention – with every meningitis, diphtheria or whooping cough vaccine meaning a potential course of antibiotics forgone. And the 20th century’s largest reductions in infectious disease occurred not because of antibiotics, but thanks to better sanitation and public health. (Even in the 2000s, the threat of MRSA was addressed with tried-and-tested methods such as handwashing and cleaning protocols – not new antibiotics.)

(Good, we imagine?

No one wants to imagine people their grandparents’ or parents’ age having sex, so we cast out those thoughts. What we get as a result are limited discussions and representations of sex in later life; think of how few scenes we see of older people getting it on in movies and TV, and how often post-50 sex and Viagra are the butt of the joke for late-night comedians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re all going to get older eventually (hopefully, anyway) but because we’ve stigmatized post-50 sex so much, we’re ill-prepared for the realities of it, Chavez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a lack of comprehensive sex education tailored to older age groups, leaving many individuals uninformed about the changes and challenges they may face regarding sexuality as they age,” she told HuffPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This all leads to misconceptions and curiosity about what sexual experiences are like in later life,” she said. “Overall, increased awareness, education, and open dialogue about sex and aging can help eliminate the mystery and promote healthier attitudes toward sexuality in older age groups.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heartening reality is that those who are AARP-aged are still having, enjoying and desiring sex, even when they’re not coupled up. Four out of 10 people ages 65-80 are still sexually active, &lt;a href="https://www.michiganmedicine.org/health-lab/sex-after-65-poll-finds-gender-differences-lack-communication" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="according to a 2018 study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e4aa6e4b048e97f078fdd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.michiganmedicine.org/health-lab/sex-after-65-poll-finds-gender-differences-lack-communication" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;according to a 2018 study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;from the &lt;a href="http://healthyagingpoll.org/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="National Poll on Healthy Aging" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e4aa6e4b048e97f078fdd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="http://healthyagingpoll.org/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;National Poll on Healthy Aging&lt;/a&gt;. And whether or not they have an active sex life, nearly two-thirds of older adults said they’re interested in sex. More than half said sex is important to their quality of life, according to the same study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To shed some light on post-70 sex, we asked sex therapists and people over 70 to share some things people should know about sex in the golden years.

When we’re young, we don’t want to believe that old, saggy humans still want sex. But we do. Physical attraction and satisfaction, communication and personal hygiene are still important, even in our 70s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are certain things that have to be worked out, of course: &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/erectile-dysfunction" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="erectile dysfunction" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e4aa6e4b048e97f078fdd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/topic/erectile-dysfunction" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;erectile dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/e" target="_blank" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="extreme dryness" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e4aa6e4b048e97f078fdd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/e" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;extreme dryness&lt;/a&gt;, pain and &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/best-sex-positions-over-60-experts_l_65bbfc0ae4b0102bd2d86548" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="limited positions" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e4aa6e4b048e97f078fdd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="65bbfc0ae4b0102bd2d86548" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;limited positions&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s great to be alive at a time when science has solved some of these issues with easy solutions. Drugs and creams for both women and men, as well as physical exercises and therapies, make it possible to enjoy sex at this late stage. I understand that there are many people at this age who have debilitating diseases or physical limitations that make it very difficult or even undesirable to have sex. And I certainly respect that. But there are also many older people, older than us even, who still want and have sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the biggest problem is the stigma of being old, with gray hair or bald, saggy breasts and butts, means that there’s no longer a need for sex. When we were in our 50s, we thought that if we were alive in our 70s, we’d be done. To our pleasant surprise, it’s just the opposite.” ― &lt;em&gt;Frank, 76, who lives in the Texas panhandle and has been married for almost 53 years&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: blackCAT via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;blackCAT via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;People AARP-aged are still having sex, enjoying sex and desiring sex, even when they're not coupled up.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The frequency decreases but the quality often increases.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the most surprising thing about sex after 70 for many folks is that it has the potential to be better than ever. Many of my clients in their 70s (and 80s!) report that while the frequency of sex generally declines with age, the quality improves. Sometimes this is related to so-called sexual dysfunction which leads them to discover new pathways to pleasure. For example, if penetration is painful or uncomfortable, they often learn to explore and enjoy full-body pleasure. Or if erectile issues arise, many folks finally discover that the hands, tongue, lips, toys and skin can lead to intense pleasure and orgasms in the absence of penile erections.” ― &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sexwithdrjess.com/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Jess O’Reilly" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e4aa6e4b048e97f078fdd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.sexwithdrjess.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;Jess O’Reilly&lt;/a&gt;, a sexologist and the host of the &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0sL5FqZrxCAa94DhntIm5M" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Sex With Dr. Jess podcast " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e4aa6e4b048e97f078fdd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://open.spotify.com/show/0sL5FqZrxCAa94DhntIm5M" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;Sex With Dr. Jess podcast &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Erectile dysfunction doesn’t need to end your sex life. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve dealt with ED for over 20 years.

No one is going to give you a disapproving glance and no one is going to discourage you from doing something you want to do and, really, who cares if they do?” ―&lt;em&gt; David Daniel, a 70-something in Cedar Rapids, Iowa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It can be painful, especially for women.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The aging process has a tremendous impact on sexual functioning and satisfaction. In addition, as we age, we tend to have more medical issues and many medications can impact sexual function. As we age, we often experience changes in our sexual behavior, desire, what we find arousing, and overall sexual well-being. Some of the biological changes we experience as we age involve hormones: When women reach middle age, they experience &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/menopause" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="menopause" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e4aa6e4b048e97f078fdd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/topic/menopause" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="15"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;. This happens because the body stops producing estrogen. Some of the results of decreased estrogen production include vaginal dryness, decreased lubrication, and loss of elasticity in the vaginal tissues. This often leads to discomfort and even pain during intercourse. In some cases, there may be a decrease in nipple and clitoral sensitivity.

While peeing in the pool is gross, is it really all that bad? What can happen if you or someone around you does this just once? In the name of science, we tapped a toxicologist, infectious disease physician and microbiologist to break it all down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens when you pee in a pool?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few things. The big issue is the interaction of urine with the chemicals in the pool. “When human urine combines with chemicals that are present in chlorinated swimming pools, potentially harmful compounds called disinfection byproducts, or DBPs, can form,” said &lt;a href="https://www.medstarhealth.org/doctors/kelly-krisna-johnson-arbor-md" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Kelly Johnson-Arbor," data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e1ed5e4b0df16e32b96fa" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.medstarhealth.org/doctors/kelly-krisna-johnson-arbor-md" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. Kelly Johnson-Arbor,&lt;/a&gt; a toxicologist at MedStar Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Stefan Cristian Cioata via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Stefan Cristian Cioata via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The more organic matter in the pool, the more chloramines are produced (that includes pee, along with sweat and poop particles).&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Urine naturally contains nitrogen-containing compounds like urea, ammonia and creatinine, Johnson-Arbor explained. “These nitrogen-rich compounds can react with chlorine or other disinfectants found in swimming pools to form DBPs that can cause harmful health effects.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chlorine specifically forms something called chloramines when it binds to human waste products (like pee) in the pool, according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthy-swimming/toolkit/chloramines-and-pool-operation.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e1ed5e4b0df16e32b96fa" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/healthy-swimming/toolkit/chloramines-and-pool-operation.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. These chloramines can build up in the water and off-gas into the air. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This isn’t just a urine thing. “Chlorine interacts with many kinds of organic matter,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=tmelendy" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Thomas Melendy" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e1ed5e4b0df16e32b96fa" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=tmelendy" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thomas Melendy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, associate professor of microbiology and immunology, and biochemistry in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at the University at Buffalo in New York. “The reason it’s put in pools is to act as an antibacterial and antiviral. It helps to keep the pool clean and noninfectious.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How big of a deal is it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It depends on how you look at it. “From an infectious disease point of view, peeing in a well-chlorinated pool doesn’t really present a problem. That’s not to be confused with pooping in the pool, which does,” said &lt;a href="https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=trusso" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Thomas Russo," data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e1ed5e4b0df16e32b96fa" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=trusso" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Dr. Thomas Russo,&lt;/a&gt; professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo. While &lt;a href="https://www.europeanurology.com/article/S0302-2838%2815%2900206-7/abstract/-sterile-urine-and-the-presence-of-bacteria" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="urine isn’t sterile" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e1ed5e4b0df16e32b96fa" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.europeanurology.com/article/S0302-2838%2815%2900206-7/abstract/-sterile-urine-and-the-presence-of-bacteria" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;urine isn’t sterile&lt;/a&gt;, most people don’t carry major pathogens in their pee that chlorine can’t handle, Russo said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But chloramines can be an issue, according to Melendy. “Any time chlorine interacts with organic matter, it makes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; chloramines,” he said. “The more chloramines that are produced,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; the higher the risk of skin, eye and lung irritation.” (This can be a bigger problem in people with underlying respiratory issues such as asthma, he said.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If ventilation in an area isn’t great, chloramines that off-gas from the water will settle on the water’s surface, where they can cause symptoms, according to the CDC. One of those chloramines is trichloramine, a volatile chemical that evaporates easily into the air and causes that signature “chlorine” smell in swimming pools, Johnson-Arbor said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The more organic matter in th&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;e pool, the more chloramines are produced, Melendy said. (That includes pee, along with sweat and poop particles.) This also inactivates the chlorine, he points out. “The more organic matter you introduce to the pool, the less effective chlorine is at being an antibacterial because it gets used up,” Melendy said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if you pee in a saltwater pool?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The impact is likely the same, Johnson-Arbor said. “Saltwater pools use &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35725075/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="electrochemically generated chlorine" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e1ed5e4b0df16e32b96fa" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35725075/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;electrochemically generated chlorine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; instead of liquid chlorine for disinfection,” Johnson-Arbor said. (Electrochemically generated chlorine happens after an electric current is passed through a concentrated salt solution.) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Since this process still generates chlorine, any nitrogen-containing matter that is present in a saltwater pool can still combine with the chlorine to generate DBPs,” Johnson-Arbor said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if only one person pees in the pool?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you really have to go and there’s no bathroom nearby, it’s fair to wonder how much of an issue it will be if just one person pees in the pool. “It’s a matter of concentration,” Melendy said. “There’s so much chlorine and water in the pool. If just one pers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;on pees in a very large pool, it’s unli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;kely to create a significant irritant.” (However, he points out that sensitivity varies from person to person.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If it’s one person in a really small pool, it might have a significant impact,” Melendy said. “Conversely, if it’s a big pool and a lot of people are doing it, i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;t’s going to produce lots of chloramine gases. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a nuanced thing.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Johnson-Arbor also pointed out that this isn’t just a urine issue. Sweat and poop particles inevitably slip off your skin and into the water, too. “In addition, if individuals do not shower before entering pools, their loose hairs and skin cells can transfer from their bodies into the pool, further contributing to development of DBPs,” Johnson-Arbor said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

People aren’t cooking as much as they used to, and they’re snacking more instead of sitting down to meals.

One of the reasons it’s important to get enough of this nutrient, she said, is because potassium plays an important role in regulating blood pressure. “But the foods richest in potassium — fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and legumes — aren’t eaten enough as part of the standard American diet,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One reason for this imbalance, said registered dietician nutritionist &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/corymygrant/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Cory Mygrant" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e1f59e4b048e97f076f45" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.linkedin.com/in/corymygrant/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="16"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cory Mygrant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, is the high sodium content in our diets. “Many people consume too much sodium, often due to processed foods, and so they aren’t getting enough potassium to balance it out. Potassium is a crucial nutrient that works alongside sodium to help maintain the right balance of fluids and electrolytes in your body. This imbalance can lead to high blood pressure, which is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Two top sources of potassium, potatoes and bananas, have been “demonized” in some circles, Hernandez said, but they’re great sources of a vital nutrient: “A medium baked potato has 164 calories and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170030/nutrients" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="952 milligrams of potassium" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e1f59e4b048e97f076f45" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170030/nutrients" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="17"&gt;&lt;span&gt;952 milligrams of potassium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and a medium banana has just 105 calories, but &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/173944/nutrients" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="422 milligrams of potassium" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689e1f59e4b048e97f076f45" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/173944/nutrients" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="18"&gt;&lt;span&gt;422 milligrams of potassium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole Foods, Not Pills, Will Make A Difference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All this talk of shortfalls might leave you wondering if it’s at all possible to keep yourself well nourished these days.

If you aren’t already eating well, moving your body, drinking water and managing your stress, don’t waste money on supplements. Taking supplements and then eating processed foods is not the same as eating a whole foods diet and using supplements to help ensure you’re getting enough.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She offered this example of the joy of whole foods: “When you eat an avocado, it’s not just about the potassium or dietary fiber, but the synergy of the nutrients working together.

It’s also about how satisfying it tastes.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

&lt;p&gt;On the coast of Acadia National Park in Maine, a lone seal suns itself ahead of me in a little nook on the rocky shore. I’ve never seen a seal in real life before. She is silky white and grey, with her belly out in the sun and her flipper tilted up. I’ve spent the past day bopping around Bar Harbor with my friend, making jokes about curing my depression with day drinking and lobster rolls and the cool Maine air. I feel okay. I’m six weeks back on Zoloft, which has been terrible, but at least my Adam Sandler meets Caroline Bessette Kennedy outfit isn’t pinching anywhere on my matronly body. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maine makes me remember my high school East Coast Ivy aspirations but the memories feel like a movie I watched, not my own life. I try to find them in me, the me here now, but the only thing that’s left is maybe the desire to plant some hydrangeas where they won’t get scorched by the North Carolina sun when I get home. On the rugged coastline, I watch the tide come in below me in surges of clear North Atlantic water, turning the submerged green plants into a color richer and more sparkling than fine jewels. I’ve been thinking about fairy tales and motherhood, who I’ve been and wondering who I might still become–or if that’s even possible at 38? It must be, but it is very hard for me to imagine–and now, watching the seal sun herself, I think about the Selkie Wife.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" id="h-postpartum-depression-amp-the-selkie-wife-a-story-of-motherhood-and-losing-and-finding-myself"&gt;Postpartum Depression &amp;amp; the Selkie Wife: A Story of Motherhood and Losing (and Finding) Myself&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Selkie Wife is a fairy tale about a creature that can shapeshift between a woman and a seal, and who is forced into marriage as a human woman when her seal skin is stolen. Unable to return to the ocean without her skin, she lives life on land, staring longingly into the sea despite her husband and children on shore. In the story, she eventually finds her seal skin—or has it returned to her by her children—and leaves for the ocean. Like the Selkie Wife, I imagine myself slipping into these cold, clear waves where my fat is turned to sleekness and the waters are deep and dark. I imagine myself swimming very far away where it is silent and I am alone. I’m committed to living, as I’ve told all my care providers in the weeks leading up to this trip, but I understand the Selkie Wife. Some call it post-partum depression, or “the baby blues,” but for me, it is an inexplicable grief I am reborn into with each child. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Post-Partum Depression is one of those tedious subjects no one really wants to read about—not even me—which never makes an auspicious subject for writing. When you are pregnant, the doctors make you fill out the depression and anxiety screener sheet every time they ask you to pee in a cup—so, I’m already weary of the topic. Beyond that, depression is boring. Someone else’s depression is even less interesting than their dreams. Like menopause or incontinence or anything involving your pelvic floor, post-partum depression ends up getting muddled through, privately, in our own mundane ways, none of which is interesting or pathological enough to warrant an essay. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is no surprise to my doctors or therapists I am depressed, but it is somehow always a surprise to me. I’m one of those lucky people that gets the pre-disposition to it via genes &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; trauma. Like having mommy &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; daddy issues. A yeast infection &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; bacterial vaginosis. But there is a part of me that still fundamentally misunderstands depression as a lack of will to live or a question of my vitality. I’m always semi-delusional like no no, you don’t understand, I want to do and be all these things, I’m depressed because I can’t and I’m not!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Science mostly explains that post-partum depression is due to the hormone progesterone drop within the three days after birth, and while I understand it, I have a hard time accepting it. If post-partum depression was simply a matter of hormones, then when my hormones regulated, so would I! I shouldn’t be two years out in a sea of grief. When I start looking at the timeline, it is admittedly more complicated than those three days to level out progesterone. The other hormones involved in pregnancy go back to normal levels three to six &lt;em&gt;months&lt;/em&gt; after birth. But if you breastfeed (like I did), those don’t go back until three to six months after &lt;em&gt;weaning.&lt;/em&gt; This means, if you breastfeed for one year (the recommendation), you can expect to be hormonally disrupted for up to 18 months. And then, just because your hormone levels return to pre-pregnancy, that doesn’t mean your body does. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this superficially, of course. I’m somehow sweatier now and I can’t budge my weight lower than 20lbs over my pre-pregnancy self. My hair has fallen out and regrown, leaving a wild demarcation line of regrowth. Then there’s the changes from my three other children–the stretch marks under my arms and knees and belly from the swelling in pre-eclampsia, the loose skin that just waits for the next pregnancy or death, and the softness in my breasts. But it’s deeper than flesh. Your child’s DNA—DNA that is totally separate from yours—stays in your body after pregnancy. Starting as early as six weeks, the DNA from your child migrates into your body and can stay there a lifetime. This foreign DNA can have positive and/or negative effects on things like wound healing, lactation, thyroid function, autoimmune disease, cancer and maternal emotional, and psychological health (&lt;a class="" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26316378"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;). And during breastfeeding? The milk isn’t just flowing out: immune information is flowing back into your body—changing &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; immune profile for years to come. I feel this as a kind of body horror, not empowerment. It feels like becoming a mother is to become a chimera–a single organism composed of different genetic identities. Each time I give birth, I am reborn as a new and far stranger creature. Four children later, there is no part of me that feels like myself. I do not even know my own face. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My youngest son and current reason for traveling through this post-partum wasteland of self, is two-and-a-half. He is a lover and rubs my arm, all night long, even in his deep sleep. He hates my moles and will hone in on one or two that are directly in his rubbing path to try and pick off. Before the Selkie Wife, before the Zoloft, lying there bleeding while trying to put him to sleep, I thought a lot about changelings. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fairy tales, a changeling is the substitute left behind when a human is stolen by the fae. The substitute can be a piece of wood, spelled to resemble the stolen human or a deformed or ravenous creature with the human’s face. It is frequently a child who cries all the time or acts too old for their age or uncanny in some way. Nearly all those fairy tales tell a story of a child being replaced, not the mother. I keep imagining myself being substituted by someone else—someone who wears my skin, and my face, but that both me and my baby recognize is not me. It goes like this–one day I go to pick up my son and he reaches to rub his mother’s familiar moles but finds them no longer there, only smooth, perfect skin. Gasp, horror. An &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; mother, a changeling mother, has taken my place. She will try to soothe him just the same, but he knows—he knows something is wildly wrong. This is not his mother, she is only wearing her face.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I imagine this other mother is better than me—placid, less sweaty, less the extra twenty pounds swaddling her belly. I imagine her in chic, flowing white while she feeds the baby organic fruits and never screams back. I feel the horror in the imaginary story from my child’s perspective—of finding the dynamic warmth of your messy, sweaty mother and her witchy moles replaced by cool, smooth perfection. I take the Zoloft to fix my brain chemistry, but it can never fix the part of my grief that is rooted in finding that I cannot substitute a better, more perfect being as the mother of my children. They’ve only got me—my mistakes, my insecurities, my struggles, and my moles. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If I look at it through a Jungian lens, where every element or character in this scene is a reflection of myself, I can see that this imaginary tableau reveals both my longing for another—&lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;—mother to take my place, but also my horror at not recognizing myself in the role of mother at all. When I look in the mirror these days, I don’t see myself at all. I see someone’s sad mom–sweaty and chubby and unnecessary. I have no idea who she is and even when I try to care for her, I feel like I get it all wrong and I long for the foaming tide and the shimmer of my sealskin. I just want to unzip myself out of this terrible form and go back to the dark water where the stars seem to touch the horizon and nobody needs me to find their soccer socks. But to go back to the sealskin is to leave my children. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Maine, my baby refused to Facetime me. He was determined to wait it out until I got home and he could rub my arm instead. What I’m about to admit makes me a terrible mother, I know. But when I leave my children, I don’t really miss them all that much. I truthfully don’t think about them unless I’m telling someone about them or anxious about the person I’ve left to care for them, or replying to their texts. I don’t resonate with descriptions of the relationship to my children in terms of someone who is part of me or someone whom I am always longing for. It is simply that these are the people I care most about. The closest I’ve ever or will ever allow anyone to reach me.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Much of my comfort with leaving is knowing I will return. I am committed, after all. The selkie wife can shapeshift—she could come back to her children on the shore–but in no version does she leave the water again. It is a difficult part of the story for me. It feels so cut and dry–couldn’t she have split the difference? And I think that’s what I end up trying at this point post-partum–to belong both fully to myself while also belonging fully to my children. But no matter how physically I can divide it, spiritually there is something zero sum about motherhood. No matter how much me and my partner strive for 50/50 or how much I organize things to give myself time away, I feel like a battery that must be drained for anyone else to be filled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to blame society for this zero-sum situation. There’s so much to blame–the lack of substantive support, the way we force new parents to go back to work right away, the white-Victorian ideals of motherhood and the way this version of capitalism puts the responsibility of surviving entirely on individuals and then prunes back our opportunities to do so. But like hormones, while I can explain my post-partum struggles this way, I feel like it’s an incomplete answer. I’ve had four wildly different pregnancies, births and circumstances. I’ve been a stay-at-home mom and a working mom, a single one and a married one, a poor one and a middle-class one. The consistent thread in all of them is that I am most vulnerable to depression when reality collides with my vulnerable post-partum self. Each time, I’ve left the water in the form of a woman of my own volition, like the Selkie does, but it’s when I realize my sealskin has been stolen and I am now fixed to this shore that the grief overwhelms me. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most interpretations of the Selkie Wife view the husband in the fairy tale as the patriarchal villain, stealing her sealskin and pinning her against her will to the shore. But in truth, I am my own husband. I am the one who wanted this, who longed to be here, who committed, ruthlessly, to being a mother. I am the one who stuffed my seal skin into the chimney to keep it safe, and who takes it out in the dead of night to move it again. The husband part of me is &lt;em&gt;committed&lt;/em&gt; to them in a way I’ve never been committed to myself. I don’t think I would have ever had the courage to leave my abusive family or ex-husband if I hadn’t done it for my children. I wouldn’t be so driven to succeed if they weren’t depending entirely on me. My commitment to living is really a commitment to mothering. But that’s the whole crux of motherhood that I end up mourning each time, the thing hormones and society cannot explain: once you’ve met yourself on that shore, you can never wholly belong to yourself again. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I leave the seal to her waters and fly back home the same day my middle two leave for their week-long youth service trips. While my youngest one is happily reunited with my moles, it is a long week before my older ones return to me. I am in different seasons of motherhood at the same time and I start seeing something new. For these older children, the season is turning, and the moon is rising into the dark and they’ve started slipping away into the depths of the sea. They come back with their hair wet and their faces shining and I meet them on the shore and can only know what they want to tell me. Somehow, when we shapeshift and slide into those waters, we are each alone. It is only on land where I can meet my children and they me. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The worst answer–the one that I hate because it leaves me in this sweaty, miserable mess–is that there is no answer. That this is an inherent tension in being human. We cannot substitute better versions of ourselves. To live in community, perhaps we can only meet each other on the shore, where we then no longer belong wholly to ourselves. That after giving birth I become so much more sensitive and aware of the world, deeply feeling all its tensions both around and inside me, and this demands both medication and tenderness. I slip back into the routine of taking my meds, working, ubering my children everywhere, carrying my screaming toddler out of Target, and scheduling time with my partner for meetings and for a moment to breathe. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s only one part of the Selkie Wife that I still wonder about–her child in the fairy stories who finds the sealskin and returns it to his mother, thereby setting her free. Even though it feels impossible to ever find a young and new part of me, I have a vague recollection of feeling exactly this old, exactly this matronly and sad with my first at the age of twenty-two. So I hang on to hope that there is still some part of me that will return with its gifts of youth and freedom, like a tide that always returns to the shore.&lt;/p&gt;

The findings, published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2500830122" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, provide evidence that aversive societal conditions are linked to the development of personality traits associated with callousness, exploitation, and moral disregard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an analysis of more than 1.7 million individuals across 183 countries and over 140,000 people from all 50 U.S. states, researchers found a consistent, though modest, association between adverse societal conditions and higher levels of what psychologists refer to as the “Dark Factor of Personality.” This general factor reflects a tendency to prioritize one’s own interests while disregarding—or even causing—harm to others, often accompanied by beliefs that justify such behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark personality traits refer to enduring patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are socially and ethically aversive. These include traits like narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism, sadism, and spitefulness. Although each trait emphasizes different features—such as callousness in psychopathy or manipulativeness in Machiavellianism—research over the past decade suggests they share a common core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shared disposition, termed the Dark Factor of Personality (or simply “D”), is thought to reflect a general tendency to pursue personal gain at the expense of others, underpinned by beliefs that such behavior is justifiable. For example, someone high in D might believe that “everyone looks out for themselves” or that “most people deserve what they get.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as intelligence researchers have identified a “g” factor that underlies cognitive ability, personality researchers argue that D underlies all dark traits. People high in D are more likely to behave dishonestly, seek revenge, exploit others, and rationalize unethical behavior. But what shapes the development of this psychological tendency?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the new study hypothesized that certain adverse social environments might foster the development of darker personality profiles. They refer to these as “aversive societal conditions” (ASC), measured by four factors: corruption, economic inequality, poverty, and violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is that in settings where exploitation, injustice, and insecurity are common, self-interested behavior might be perceived not only as acceptable but as necessary for survival. In such societies, people may learn that others cannot be trusted, that cheating pays off, or that harming others is a legitimate way to get ahead. Over time, such beliefs may become internalized and crystallize into stable personality traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was motivated by “an intertwining between theoretical and pragmatic reasons,” according to lead author Ingo Zettler of the University of Copenhagen. “Theoretically, there have always been ideas that societal conditions contribute to the proliferation of certain personality traits in a society, but research has not looked too much into very aversive (or antisocial) personality characteristics so far. Pragmatically, we were able to collect survey responses from close to two million people from more than 180 countries, which, we believe, is a good data set to explore whether aversive societal conditions also relate to the proliferation of aversive personality characteristics across societies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers created an index of aversive societal conditions across countries and U.S. states using publicly available data. Importantly, they focused on how these conditions looked about 20 years before personality data were collected, to examine whether long-term exposure during formative years predicted later personality tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers drew on a massive dataset of individuals who voluntarily completed the Dark Factor of Personality questionnaire through an online platform, which offers feedback on personality. (&lt;a href="https://qst.darkfactor.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;You can take the test here&lt;/a&gt;.) After applying various quality control checks and matching participants’ self-reported country with geolocated IP data, the final sample included 1,791,542 people from 183 countries, and a separate sample of 144,576 individuals across 50 U.S. states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each person completed a validated short version of the D questionnaire. Items included statements such as “My own pleasure is all that matters” and “People who mess with me always regret it.” Participants rated how much they agreed or disagreed with each item.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each country and state, the researchers calculated an ASC index based on corruption, income inequality, poverty rates, and homicide rates from 2000–2004. These measures were combined using principal component analysis to create a single score reflecting how aversive the local societal conditions were at that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multilevel regression analyses revealed that individuals living in countries or states with higher ASC scores tended to have higher D scores. While the effect sizes were small, the findings were statistically significant and consistent across both the international sample and the 50 U.S. states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that average levels of dark personality traits varied systematically across U.S. states, with certain regions consistently scoring higher on the Dark Factor of Personality than others. States such as Nevada, New York, Texas, Louisiana, California, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee were among those with the highest average D scores. These states also tended to have higher levels of aversive societal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, states such as Vermont, Utah, New Hampshire, Oregon, Maine, Alaska, Minnesota, Idaho, Montana, and Colorado had the lowest average D scores in the sample. These states generally exhibited more favorable socioecological conditions during the early 2000s, with lower levels of violence, corruption, and poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We did expect to find a link between aversive societal conditions and the proliferation of aversive personality characteristics, but it was nice to see this replicating within the same country,” Zettler told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that people’s personality traits—specifically those related to selfishness, moral disengagement, and interpersonal harm—are not only shaped by individual or genetic factors but also by the broader social environment. This supports the view that personality development is sensitive to socioecological conditions, particularly during adolescence and early adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In societies marked by widespread corruption and violence, people may learn that exploiting others is normal or even necessary. Over time, repeated exposure to such environments may promote beliefs and behaviors that align with the Dark Factor of Personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the researchers found that this association was stronger among younger individuals and in societies that emphasize individualism. These patterns suggest that cultural values and developmental timing may moderate the influence of aversive societal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also held up when using alternative measures of societal aversiveness, such as an index of rule violations (including tax evasion and fraudulent politics), providing further support for the link between harsh environments and the proliferation of dark traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would say there are two main take-aways,” Zettler said. “First, the average levels of aversive personality characteristics differ across societies. While there are also many differences between people within the same society, there are also differences between societies. Second, reducing aversive conditions in one’s society does not only facilitate the life for several people in the society, but might also reduce the likelihood of very aversive (or selfish) individuals in this society in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study’s scale is impressive, there are still some caveats to consider. First, the researchers used online convenience samples, meaning the participants were not randomly selected and may not fully represent the general population. Second, although the analysis accounts for time lags to reduce the risk of reverse causality, the data are still correlational. This means the findings point to an association—not a definitive causal link—between adverse environments and dark personality traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another consideration is the potential variability in the quality of the societal data used to build the ASC index. For example, some countries may underreport corruption or violence, which could influence the accuracy of the index. The researchers also acknowledge that they do not know how long participants had lived in their stated country or state, making it difficult to determine the duration of exposure to aversive conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study opens the door to further research on how environments interact with personality development. “We are continuing in trying to better understand the development of the D factor, as well as how it expresses in certain behavior in certain situations (e.g., based on different situational affordances),” Zettler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2500830122" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Aversive societal conditions explain differences in ‘dark’ personality across countries and US states&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Ingo Zettler, Lau Lilleholt, Martina Bader, Benjamin E.

Gas chromatography separates the compounds, and mass spectrometry weighs them, allowing you to determine the precise nature of the molecules present.

My name is Kaitlin Reilly, and I’m here to round up this week’s best wellness tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Are you drinking less these days — or just more carefully considering how much you imbibe? If so, you’re not alone: A recent Gallup poll found that many Americans are &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/record-number-americans-see-moderate-103548097.html" data-ylk="slk:rethinking their relationship with alcohol;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;rethinking their relationship with alcohol&lt;/a&gt;. Today 53% of U.S. adults say moderate drinking is bad for your health, compared with just 28% in 2015. The increase is driven largely by young adults, but older adults are also more likely than ever to view even one or two drinks a day as risky. That leads to less drinking overall, with the Gallup poll finding that reported drinking by Americans was among the lowest in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What could be behind this change? It may have to do with &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/alcohol-good-bad-heres-experts-123044393.html" data-ylk="slk:shifting guidelines and attitudes around imbibing;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;shifting guidelines and attitudes around imbibing&lt;/a&gt; from public health officials.

That’s because as you get closer to bedtime, the body becomes “less efficient at handling sugar, so late meals can lead to higher blood sugar and may disrupt sleep in some people,” dietitian Michelle Routhenstein explains. Plus, research has shown that people who eat dinner earlier are more likely to lose weight, while people eating later are more likely to gain it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still feel hungry post-dinner?

Some good options are pistachios or cherries — they both contain melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/person-lifting-weights" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🏋️;cpos:19;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🏋️&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Do ‘just one set’ at the gym&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Become more efficient at building muscle by following this tip from &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/fitness/exercise/articles/study-says-one-set-rule-143607354.html" data-ylk="slk:Tom’s Guide;cpos:20;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Tom’s Guide&lt;/a&gt;: Do just one set at the gym.

An easy one that you can follow right now is to leave your phone outside the bedroom, especially if you’re prone to scrolling before shutting your eyes.

Our friends at &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:28;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/your-body/oral-health/articles/dentists-reveal-time-brush-teeth-110000945.html" data-ylk="slk:Women’s Health;cpos:28;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Women’s Health&lt;/a&gt; spoke to dentists who have the answer: Brush right after you wake up, before you have anything to eat or drink. Not only will it squash “horrible morning breath,” dentist Steven Katz says, but it will also “remove the plaque and bacteria that developed overnight.” Plus, dentist Anjali Rajpal says that brushing with toothpaste before you eat protects your teeth from acid (like in a morning glass of OJ) by coating your teeth with “protective fluoride, hydroxyapatite, calcium phosphate or other minerals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:29;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/woman_running_facing_right_dark_skin_tone" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🏃🏿‍♀️‍➡️;cpos:29;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🏃🏿‍♀️‍➡️&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Work out twice a week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Only have time to work out a couple of days a week, like on the weekend?

This follows &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:32;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62450870/weekend-exercise-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:previous research;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:32;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; that shows that exercising on weekends offers the same reduced risk of 264 diseases as sweating it out during the week. While staying active as often as you can is ideal, if you’re strapped for time, squeeze in as much exercise as you can when you have a few free hours: Go for a spin class or hike with friends instead of brunch, or run around with your kids at a park instead of heading to the movie theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:33;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/canned-food" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🥫;cpos:33;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🥫&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pick healthier versions of ultra-processed foods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ultra-processed foods have a bad rap — &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:34;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/ultra-processed-foods-linked-higher-174518565.html" data-ylk="slk:and for good reason;cpos:34;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;and for good reason&lt;/a&gt;. But a new report from the American Heart Association says not all of them are the same. While the organization recommends cutting back on these types of foods — think highly processed meats like hot dogs and sausages, as well as packaged cookies, chips and pastries — healthier options include “certain whole grain breads, low-sugar yogurts, tomato sauces and nut- or bean-based spreads.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Overall, though, the problem with ultra-processed foods is that they can contain high amounts of fat, sugar and sodium and not enough nutrients, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:35;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/beating-maha-punch-american-heart-090042557.html" data-ylk="slk:CNN;cpos:35;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; reports. Keep them as a minimal part of your diet by picking whole foods like vegetables, fruit, nuts, eggs and fish whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:36;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/person-gesturing-ok" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🙆;cpos:36;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🙆&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Practice wall Pilates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Wall Pilates is exactly what it sounds like: Pilates you do against the wall — and as &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:37;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/fitness/exercise/articles/think-pilates-too-easy-wall-203000696.html" data-ylk="slk:Women’s Health;cpos:37;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Women’s Health&lt;/a&gt; reports, it’s surprisingly challenging. The movements are based on the ones you’d find in a traditional Pilates class, except using a wall to improve stability, support and resistance. One move to try at home is the “roll-up,” in which you lie on your back with feet flexed against a wall and arms overhead. Exhale as you curl up and reach toward your toes, then repeat for eight reps at a time. Your abs may burn, but you’ll get stronger with every move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 09:00:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAJBVV95cUxQbXlhUHBUTzlKNGNwbTIyOXJxN0NBU3hYNkdMeWJuWEZGZk1tOWZydUdZSzRsc1dQbnZrSFdLdlFtMGdiVXJyTFp3eVIxQ25vRUJlWGYzSVBudVhIVDZUcVJvOTY3cjdEMjJSVjZpZVhtbTJiTG8tcXZJWW4tUW1FRFp4UmR3TUh0aDgyRVJUR0otbHh5VC1LenpndjBSSE5LbUcybndYTEc3bzRhVzllcEh5Tl81ejhGZllkamxhRFBsdW9kUVFqaHpGaENHUUtLeE1naVpsYU81QzNJdGVZOU5QQ3ZreXhQSTFSVXpqVEI0UlRzQ2RUSjZ2bXRZLXVNUTJTejNhamc</guid></item><item><title>蓝光对睡眠的危害程度如何？ -《纽约时报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNTHRnNmxDQ1ZEd2lqMkVnQnFHbkhiTkYxb3Jid05mWWlMRjY5Sk5WTE5BdUhHaFdUU2tmNXY5UXVoZVpfQUgxTkxaRDZSY0IyVmpwRE9YYjZSaTRpM2NKNnQxckxyYkc3dDRJU19OWi1LRHBfYnJ2djM1bk1VRTFybEVkb1ZVcFBW?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 09:00:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNTHRnNmxDQ1ZEd2lqMkVnQnFHbkhiTkYxb3Jid05mWWlMRjY5Sk5WTE5BdUhHaFdUU2tmNXY5UXVoZVpfQUgxTkxaRDZSY0IyVmpwRE9YYjZSaTRpM2NKNnQxckxyYkc3dDRJU19OWi1LRHBfYnJ2djM1bk1VRTFybEVkb1ZVcFBW</guid></item><item><title>为什么有些人在癌症治疗后会长出“化疗卷发” ？ - Live Science</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxQTjEtSmppeUdOQm9iM0NYVUJ1STFmQzJZY1N4QU56T2FFX1c1cnU5MDhlNThLWlFneGlpYW4yZ1JTWjl1LXpLQmY3OGcyWGlRc0VVTDNqLXR6bHJKN2J3R2VJZjhQYXdQclp1OEVmMFhJQ2o5QW5uVGwteFpIZnFiaG8tZDg0dVhvLXZTbGhyQklxWC1zY1g4RQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p id="6fae2d7d-f175-4f1e-80bc-e4c62a272f71"&gt;​​Hair is an important part of our personal identity, so its loss during cancer treatment can be distressing at an already difficult time. However, this can be a positive sign that chemotherapy is working, and the hair usually grows back after treatment, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://people.ucd.ie/desmond.tobin" target="_blank" data-url="https://people.ucd.ie/desmond.tobin" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Desmond Tobin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a dermatological scientist&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://people.ucd.ie/desmond.tobin" data-url="https://people.ucd.ie/desmond.tobin" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;at University College Dublin's Charles Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hair can look different after &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/chemotherapy.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/chemotherapy.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;chemotherapy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Tobin said. "In the vast majority of cases, post-treatment the hair regrows well and similar to the way it was before," he told Live Science. "But in the early stages of recovery, the hair texture and appearance may change."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="6fae2d7d-f175-4f1e-80bc-e4c62a272f71-2"&gt;The most commonly reported difference by patients who have completed chemotherapy is "chemo curls" — hair that regrows as curly when it had previously been straight. Usually, this changed hair returns to its original form within about a year, Tobin said. But why does hair grow back differently after chemotherapy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="02090f8a-9b67-4db6-9ef4-71b145c2ad81"&gt;To explain "chemo curls," first we need to understand how hair grows normally. Individual human hairs are long fibers of dead skin cells, composed mainly of keratin proteins,&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medschool.umich.edu/profile/4461/sunny-y-wong" target="_blank" data-url="https://medschool.umich.edu/profile/4461/sunny-y-wong" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Sunny Wong&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of dermatology at the University of Michigan Medical School, told Live Science. Each strand is created by a hair follicle — a complex factory of different cell types — which passes through a constant cycle of growth, rest and shedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="d7c118b1-4e3d-428d-a168-a2c292f8aa18"&gt;We're born with all of the hair follicles we will ever have, Tobin said. But a mixture of factors — including &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics"&gt;&lt;u&gt;genetics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, nutrition and fluctuating hormone levels during the different stages of life — means that the appearance of hair is constantly evolving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pigments control hair color: The production of sex hormones at the onset of puberty causes fair hair to darken, and pigment loss with age &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/why-does-hair-turn-gray" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/why-does-hair-turn-gray"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lightens hair to gray&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or white later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/can-gray-hair-be-reversed" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/can-gray-hair-be-reversed"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can gray hair be reversed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the shape of the hair follicles determines the shape — and, therefore, texture — of each fiber, with circular follicles producing straight hair, flattened oval follicles creating coiled hair, and a follicle somewhere in between giving looser waves or curls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-591b7722-97b5-4798-9697-9bbf176a1928" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-chemo-changes-hair-3"&gt;How chemo changes hair&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="340a83d0-ac5c-4703-af89-e2a23876d0b7"&gt;So what are chemotherapy drugs doing to these hair follicles? &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/cancer" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/cancer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cancer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; treatments target rapidly dividing cells so the hair follicles, which also contain stem cells to act as fuel for hair growth, are particularly vulnerable to damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The hair follicle is one of the most proliferative and actively dividing tissues in the body, probably second to the bone marrow or gut, so it's preferentially attacked," Tobin said. "That causes the hair follicle to go into a hyper-stress response." Chemotherapy therefore halts the hair cycle, forcing these follicles to expel fibers during the growth stage or shift them into a dormant phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, post-treatment, the stem cells within the individual hair follicles begin to wake up. The cycle gradually starts again, which enables the hair to regrow, but sometimes with a slightly altered appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The chemotherapeutic exposure will damage the existing hair follicle and may turn it into an abnormal shape so it produces a fiber of a different shape or length, maybe thinner," Tobin explained. "It depends on how that hair follicle copes with the impact of the drug."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the effect of chemotherapy on other bodily systems — such as the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/26496-endocrine-system.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/26496-endocrine-system.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;endocrine system&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is responsible for making hormones — can temporarily alter the production of pigments, leading to a change in hair color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the complexity of factors determining hair's appearance makes it difficult to predict an individual patient's response, in most cases, hair returns to normal as the body processes the remnants of the drug, Wong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These drugs work by incorporating themselves into replicating &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/37247-dna.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/37247-dna.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so it takes time for them to elute from the system," Wong explained. "Probably the cells just need to build up over time and the signals [that regulate the hair cycle] just have to return and reconfigure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="d19e37ab-db7d-47d9-99a7-f562216fcd55"&gt;The human body is remarkably resilient, and hair follicles damaged by cancer treatments can make a full recovery. Although it can be frustrating to wait for hair to return, experts urge patients to avoid damaging treatments like dyeing or straightening on their new growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hair typically grows a centimeter a month on the scalp, but good nutrition and blood supply will hopefully feed the soil in which those hair follicles are growing and improve its recovery," Tobin said.&lt;/p&gt;

It involves challenging your brain to do something unfamiliar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;Experts from the &lt;a class="TextLink_text-link__dBSS0 TextLink_enabled__dJF3l" href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/nhs" target="" aria-label="" tabindex="0"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; explain that dementia is a group of related symptoms associated with an ongoing decline of brain functioning. There are many different causes and many different types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;Dementia is not only about memory loss. It can also affect the way you speak, think, feel and behave. However, there are certain things you can do to reduce your risk of the disease. This comes as it was announced that services which are dementia "lifelines" for people living in rural &lt;a class="TextLink_text-link__dBSS0 TextLink_enabled__dJF3l" href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/county-durham" target="" aria-label="" tabindex="0"&gt;County Durham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="TextLink_text-link__dBSS0 TextLink_enabled__dJF3l" href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumberland" target="" aria-label="" tabindex="0"&gt;Northumberland&lt;/a&gt; will continue for three further years,&lt;a class="TextLink_text-link__dBSS0 TextLink_enabled__dJF3l" href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/dementia-lifelines-support-500-people-32223985" target="_blank" aria-label=" as reported by ChronicleLive.Link opens in a new tab." tabindex="0"&gt; as reported by ChronicleLive.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;Dr Helen Moore, a dementia researcher with more than 20 years’ experience in cognitive health, says one of the most effective ways to lower dementia risk is to spend five minutes a day learning something new. "It could be reading an article on a topic you’ve never explored, trying a new word in a foreign language, or even solving a different type of puzzle," she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="BoxStyles_box-container__Qk3WH BoxStyles_non-commercial__aiWwo" data-testid="recommended-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;"The key is to challenge your brain with something unfamiliar. Just five minutes a day of this mental stretching can build cognitive reserve — the brain’s resilience against decline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="HeadingThree_heading-three__PBHLs  __className_15fe42"&gt;Why it works&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;Research shows that mentally stimulating activities help strengthen neural connections and may delay the onset of Alzheimer’s symptoms. Learning something new, even in small bursts, forces the brain to adapt, creating new pathways that could help offset age-related changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="BoxStyles_box-container__Qk3WH BoxStyles_non-commercial__aiWwo" data-testid="non-commercial-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;"Think of it like exercise for your brain," Dr Moore says. "You don’t have to run a marathon — a short, consistent workout can still make a difference."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;Live-in care experts at &lt;a class="TextLink_text-link__dBSS0 TextLink_enabled__dJF3l" href="https://alderberrycare.co.uk/" target="_blank" aria-label="Alderberry CareLink opens in a new tab." tabindex="0"&gt;Alderberry Care&lt;/a&gt;, who support people with dementia, say they see the benefits of mental stimulation first-hand. "We encourage our clients to keep their minds active every day," a spokesperson from Alderberry Care said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;"It might be playing a quick game of cards, listening to a podcast, or chatting about the news. Even a short mental activity can lift mood, boost confidence, and keep the mind engaged."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;They also stress the importance of variety. They added: "Switching activities helps work different parts of the brain. One day it might be a crossword, the next day a short walk with a conversation about what you see. These little habits can add up to a big difference over time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="HeadingThree_heading-three__PBHLs  __className_15fe42"&gt;Easy ways to get started&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;If you want to try Dr Moore’s five-minute brain workout, here are a few ideas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="UnorderedList_unordered-list__gzblI"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-700e1ff3-0 VljCu"&gt;Learn a new fact every day — pick a topic you know nothing about&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-700e1ff3-0 VljCu"&gt;Try a brain teaser or puzzle you’ve never done before&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-700e1ff3-0 VljCu"&gt;Listen to a short podcast on a completely new subject&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-700e1ff3-0 VljCu"&gt;Practise a few words in another language&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-700e1ff3-0 VljCu"&gt;Write down three things you noticed today that you’ve never paid attention to before&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;While no single habit can guarantee you’ll avoid dementia, experts agree that keeping your brain active is one of the best defences. As Alderberry Care’s team puts it: "The earlier you start, the better the long-term benefits. A few minutes today could mean more memories tomorrow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Chronicle Live</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNclFvZEFIU0piMk1WemhEeUZCRGl2aGhzaldXYzhkQXJoWjhZMWR2ZEJzREJpYXpmdnB3UlpYcm82QzJfODQzZTZiNVE4YzZDemgwT2h2RExIUjBMUHpUSVNmMm5LNDFTTDFUWWFjT0N1eVJJdWE5aDRrVXVwVGpYaWNxU0gtTF9oenfSAY8BQVVfeXFMTVl0aTBDZXRGOWZXUWxZajZIMzNndkU5czdMU0xBYUFrZDdrdFRzZ0ZwN3ZURmdSWUJCb0oycVdNV19pZU42QkxUZW5tTmp1TjZET0lwdGhCZ0RNQVNHUXZIek9sT0NHRXo5V1NDdXFfczBlMENRSHpqOFNqTTVnclBBSk5ScDM3MkZ1Nk11SlE</guid></item></channel></rss>
